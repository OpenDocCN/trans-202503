    Be (and future Android) colleague Hiroshi Lockheimer. At Danger, Swetland worked
    on the kernel and other system software, and helped to ship the first couple of
    Hiptop devices. But after the first few years, most of the work tended to be incremental
    improvements, or features implemented at the request of the carrier (or killed
    on their behalf; even sometimes killed based on what product managers thought
    the carrier *might* request). Eric Fischer, who worked on text and other platform
    features at Danger (and later Android) said, “Everything we did there was in the

    Fischer，曾在Danger（后来是Android）从事文本和其他平台功能开发的工程师表示：“我们在那里做的每一件事，都在运营商接受流程缓慢保守的阴影下，这个流程能够否决任何功能或设计。”
- en: Swetland was always more interested in building new systems than iterating on
    existing ones, and he was getting frustrated. Danger had become a much larger
    organization of about 150 people by 2004, far from the tiny team he joined back
    in 2000\. It had also been four years of long hours, first helping Danger as a
    struggling startup, and then working to ship the company’s first two phones. So

    into his hiatus, he realized he was pretty happy not being at work. He also realized

    into the history of just about every country in the world. In the United States,
    railroads fueled enormous expansion and economic growth, perhaps more than any
    other technology in the 19th century. Today, railroads continue to serve as a
    vital mode for moving freight and people from place to place.

  zh: 铁路是最早的陆上交通方式之一，它们与几乎每个国家的历史息息相关。在美国，铁路推动了巨大的扩展和经济增长，可能比19世纪的任何其他技术都要重要。今天，铁路依然是运输货物和人员的一个重要方式，连接着不同的地方。
- en: Railways take advantage of two features to provide rapid and efficient transportation
    of people and goods. First, the steel wheels on steel rails waste little energy
    to friction (especially compared to rubber tires on asphalt). Locomotives may
    look huge, but their engines are almost trivial compared to the enormous weight
    they move. If your car were so efficient, it could run off a tiny string-trimmer
    engine. Second, and more important, railways run along dedicated rights of way,
    relatively direct and unobstructed paths that are not affected by motor vehicle
    traffic. These reserved tracks create a level of reliability that is hard to match
    with other modes of travel.

    enthusiasts around the world (often self-described as *railfans*). Whether it’s
    due to nostalgia for an earlier era or the simple appeal of seeing large machinery
    up close, enjoying the details of railroads is a passion for many, and there is
    much to enjoy. Perhaps more than the trains themselves, the paths they travel
    along are full of noteworthy particulars ripe for observation and appreciation.

    quickly and smoothly to its destination. The most distinct aspect of a railway
    is the rail itself, which supports the tremendous weight of trains and cargo.
    Rails are made from high-quality steel to withstand these incredible stresses.
    Look closely, and you can often note markings on the rail web that list the year
    of manufacture and other details about how each rail was made. Rails can be of
    different sizes and shapes, but they mostly follow a similar form: an I-shape
    with a bulbous head upon which wheels ride and a flat foot attached to the ties.'

  zh: 铁路轨道由所有必要的元素组成，以确保列车交通能快速而平稳地到达目的地。铁路最显著的特点就是轨道本身，它支撑着列车和货物的巨大重量。轨道是由高质量钢铁制成的，以承受这些巨大的压力。仔细观察时，你经常可以看到轨道背面上有标记，列出生产年份及其他关于轨道制造的细节。轨道的尺寸和形状可以有所不同，但它们大多遵循相似的形式：呈I形，顶部有一个膨大的部分，车轮在上面行驶，底部有一个平坦的部分与枕木相连接。
- en: The force required to move a train forward is transferred into the rail through
    friction with the driven wheels of the locomotive. Incredibly, the contact patch
    between each wheel and the rail is only the size of a small coin. That means an
    average freight train sits on an area of steel roughly the size of this book.

- en: Historically, lengths of rail were bolted together using fishplates. The joint
    between each section creates the iconic click-clack sound as the wheels of the
    train pass over the small gap. These small but frequent discontinuities generate
    wear and tear on the railway vehicles (called rolling stock) and are uncomfortable
    for passengers. Most modern tracks use welded rails to create continuous stretches
    of smooth-running track with no joints.

  zh: 历史上，轨道的接头是通过鱼尾板连接在一起的。每个轨道段之间的接头会发出标志性的咔哒声，当列车车轮经过这些小缝隙时。这些小而频繁的不连续性会对铁路车辆（称为滚动库存）造成磨损，并让乘客感到不适。大多数现代铁路使用焊接轨道，以创造连续平滑的轨道，没有接头。
- en: One challenge of eliminating these gaps is thermal movement. Steel contracts
    with low temperatures and expands with heat. Where many structures provide freedom
    to move using expansion joints, tracks with continuously welded rail restrain
    this thermal movement. On cold days, the rails experience tensile stress as they
    try to contract. On warm days, they undergo compressive stress as they try to
    expand from their restraints. At some point in between, called the *neutral temperature*,
    the rail is free of thermal stresses. If the ambient temperature deviates too
    far from the neutral temperature, the stresses can exceed the track’s strength.
    On scorching days, railways can buckle (also called sun kink), creating the danger
    of a derailment. Rails are often warmed or stretched before installation to mitigate
    the possibility of buckling. This technique raises the neutral temperature of
    the rail so that hot days don’t overload it with thermal stress.

  zh: 消除这些间隙的一个挑战是热胀冷缩。钢铁在低温下收缩，在高温下膨胀。许多结构通过使用伸缩缝来提供运动自由，而焊接轨道的轨道则限制了这种热胀冷缩的自由。在寒冷的日子里，轨道在试图收缩时会经历拉伸应力；在温暖的日子里，它们会经历压缩应力，因为它们试图从约束中膨胀。在某个中间点，称为*中性温度*，轨道不再受到热应力。如果周围温度偏离中性温度过多，轨道的应力可能会超过轨道的承载能力。在炎热的天气里，铁路可能会发生弯曲（也叫做日晒弯），从而导致脱轨的危险。为减轻弯曲的可能性，轨道通常在安装之前被加热或拉伸。这种技术提高了轨道的中性温度，以便炎热的日子不会使轨道承受过大的热应力。
- en: 'There are many ways to attach the rail to the horizontal ties (also called
    sleepers). Historically, a large steel spike with an offset head was hammered
    in place to secure each side of the rail. These spikes are still used on some
    railroads in the United States. More modern railways use one of many types of
    heavy-duty clips. In North America, ties are usually made from wood because of
    its abundance, but they can be made from concrete as well. Ties have two essential
    jobs: bear the weight of loads from the train traffic above and keep the two rails
    running with the correct space between (called the track gauge). Wooden ties often
    include a tie plate to distribute the concentrated force of the rail.'

  zh: 有许多方法可以将轨道固定在水平枕木上（也叫做道床）。历史上，使用一个带有偏头的大钢钉将轨道两侧固定住。这些钉子在美国的一些铁路上仍在使用。更现代的铁路使用多种类型的重型夹具。在北美，由于木材丰富，枕木通常使用木材制造，但也可以使用混凝土制造。枕木有两个基本任务：承载来自列车上方的载重，并保持两条轨道之间的正确间距（称为轨距）。木枕通常配有枕木板，用于分散轨道的集中压力。
- en: Maintaining an accurate gauge is critical because of the way trains stay on
    the tracks. You might think a train would struggle to navigate around a bend with
    a solid axle because the outside wheel would need to turn farther than the inside
    wheel. Cars use a *differential* between the drive wheels so they can rotate independently
    around curves. Rolling stock gets around this problem by using conical wheels.
    When the train goes around a bend, each axle shifts, so the outside wheel rides
    on a larger radius and the inner wheel on a smaller radius. This compensates for
    the difference in travel distance between the inside and outside of the curve.
    The wheel’s flange is only a safety feature to keep it on a track that is damaged
    or out of alignment. During regular operation, it shouldn’t touch the rail at
    all.

  zh: 维护精确的轨距非常关键，因为列车是通过轨道保持在轨道上的。你可能认为，列车如果使用实心轴，会在转弯时遇到困难，因为外侧车轮需要转动得比内侧车轮更多。汽车通过驱动轮之间的*差速器*来使车轮在弯道上独立转动。滚动库存通过使用圆锥形车轮解决了这个问题。当列车转弯时，每个轴会发生偏移，因此外侧车轮在更大的半径上行驶，而内侧车轮则在更小的半径上行驶。这补偿了弯道内外侧的行驶距离差异。车轮的缘缘只是为了防止轨道受损或错位时，车轮脱轨的安全设计。在正常运行时，车轮缘缘不应该与铁轨接触。
- en: Railroad ties do not sit directly on the ground below the track, called the
    subgrade. The soils are rarely strong enough to bear the immense weight of train
    traffic. Instead, an embankment of loose rock called ballast is used to spread
    the load evenly to the underlying soil. Ballast is often made from crushed stone
    because the angular features help it interlock into a solid foundation. Not only
    does it distribute the vertical forces from the track, but ballast also provides
    horizontal support to each tie, helping resist buckling due to thermal stress
    and shifting from horizontal train forces around bends. Many embankments have
    raised shoulders to provide extra resistance against lateral forces in each tie.
    The open spaces within the stone ballast allow water to flow freely through (instead
    of ponding up along the sides).

  zh: 铁路枕木并不直接放置在轨道下方的土壤上，也就是称为基床的地方。土壤通常不足以承受火车运输的巨大重量。因此，使用一种叫做道砟的松散岩石堆积物，将负荷均匀地分布到下层土壤中。道砟通常由碎石制成，因为其角状特征有助于它们相互嵌套，形成稳固的基础。道砟不仅能分散来自轨道的垂直压力，还能为每根枕木提供水平支撑，帮助抵抗由热胀冷缩产生的弯曲和由火车通过曲线时的水平力量造成的位移。许多路堤还在两侧设有加高的肩部，以提供额外的抵抗力，防止枕木在横向力量作用下移动。石砟之间的空隙允许水自由流动，而不是沿路堤两侧积水。
- en: 'The geometry of railways is a critical component in their design. Railroads
    can use a much narrower right of way than a highway because they don’t need large,
    clear zones on each side of the travel lanes. However, trains require much gentler
    curves and grades than can be navigated by motor vehicles. Couplers between cars
    can’t handle sharp bends. Also, the centripetal force around curves can create
    undue stress on passengers and cargo. One solution to this problem is similar
    to a feature used on highways: raise the outside rail so that the train leans
    into curves. This tilting, also called superelevation or *cant*, reduces the horizontal
    force felt by the train.'

  zh: 铁路的几何形状是其设计中的一个关键组成部分。与公路相比，铁路可以使用更窄的路权，因为铁路不需要在行车道两侧留出大面积的空旷区域。然而，火车需要比机动车能够通过的更平缓的曲线和坡度。车厢之间的联接装置无法应对急转弯。此外，曲线周围的向心力可能会给乘客和货物带来过大的压力。解决这个问题的一种方法类似于公路上使用的特性：抬高外侧轨道，使火车在过弯时向内倾斜。这种倾斜，也叫做超高或*外倾*，能减少火车所感受到的水平力。
- en: As for vertical alignment, trains do not have enough traction on steel rails
    to brake effectively on steep slopes. Significant uphill gradients also cause
    trains to slow down, reducing the capacity of the railway. Next time you’re driving
    parallel to a railway, watch the tracks as you travel. Although the road will
    often follow the natural ground closely, the tracks will maintain a much more
    consistent elevation with only gradual changes in slope.

  zh: 至于垂直对接，火车在钢轨上没有足够的牵引力，无法在陡坡上有效刹车。较大的上坡坡度也会使火车减速，从而减少铁路的容量。下次你开车经过铁路时，观察一下轨道。虽然公路通常会跟随自然地形，但轨道的高度会保持更为一致，坡度变化也较为平缓。
- en: The number of tracks is another essential consideration in railway design. A
    single track is less expensive to build and maintain than two but has some disadvantages.
    Most important, trains traveling in opposite directions must have a way to pass
    each other. A siding (or *passing loop*) is a short section of parallel track
    that allows trains to pass. The capacity of a single-track railroad depends on
    the number of these sidings. Careful scheduling can maximize the use of the single
    track, but two or more tracks dramatically increase the railway’s capacity and
    reliability.

- en: One significant challenge to managing railway traffic is the considerable distance
    required to stop a fully loaded train. Unlike motor vehicles whose drivers see
    and respond to hazards in real time, a train can take more than a mile to reach
    a complete stop. If a train operator can see an obstruction on the tracks while
    traveling at full speed, it is already too late. Trains sharing a railway need
    to maintain enough distance between each other to stop as required without the
    potential for collision, and they need to keep this distance without relying on
    the vision of the train crews.

- en: Over the years, many solutions to multi-train traffic management have been used.
    The earliest method was simply to establish a timetable of when and where each
    train should be at any time of the day. The apparent limitation of this system
    is the possibility of a train breaking down or encountering a problem that prevents
    it from following the schedule. In the best case, a breakdown would delay all
    the other trains on the line, and in the worst case, it could lead to a crash.
    Most modern railway traffic control schemes are instead based on a block system.
    The tracks are subdivided into segments (called blocks), and trains are prevented
    from entering any specific block until it is free from obstructions. For non-signalized
    railways, traffic can be managed through *warrants*. A dispatcher provides a standardized
    authorization to the crew for specific train movements on the main tracks. However,
    most heavily trafficked lines use signals as the primary means of controlling
    traffic between blocks.

  zh: 多年来，已经使用了许多管理多列火车交通的解决方案。最早的方法是简单地建立一个时间表，规定每列火车在一天中的何时何地应该到达。这个系统显而易见的局限性是火车可能会发生故障，或者遇到一些问题，导致无法按时执行计划。在最好的情况下，火车故障会导致所有其他火车的延误，而在最坏的情况下，它可能导致碰撞。大多数现代铁路交通控制方案改为基于区段系统。轨道被细分为多个区段（称为区块），火车只有在特定区块没有障碍物时才可以进入。对于没有信号的铁路，交通可以通过*许可证*进行管理。调度员为列车员提供标准化的授权，以进行主轨道上的特定列车调度。然而，大多数繁忙的铁路线路仍然使用信号作为控制区块之间交通的主要手段。
- en: Just like a traffic signal on a roadway (as discussed in Chapter 3), railway
    signals tell the train operator when it’s safe to proceed. In fact, many railway
    signals use combinations of lights to provide further information about the routes
    and speed limits ahead. Even in North America, many railways use different standards,
    so interpreting the meaning of their signals can take some work. The simplest
    signals are those between blocks, which usually have a single signal head with
    three lights—green, yellow, and red—similar to those used at roadway intersections.
    A green light means the following blocks are clear and the train can continue
    at full speed. Yellow indicates that the next block is clear, but the one after
    is obstructed, and the next signal will indicate stop. A red light means the next
    block is occupied, and the train cannot proceed.

- en: Some signals are controlled by a dispatcher, but many operate automatically
    using *track circuits*. In the most basic configurations, a low-voltage electric
    current is introduced into the rails at one end of the block. At the other end,
    a relay measures the current to control the nearby signals. When a train enters
    a block, the wheels and axles create a conductive path between the rails, shorting
    the circuit and de-energizing the relay. Insulating joints are installed between
    each track block to ensure that adjacent signals aren’t inadvertently triggered.
    A nonconductive material is used to attach two sections of rail while keeping
    them electrically isolated. Modern track circuits can even provide information
    about the location and velocity of each train. The relays, electronics, and batteries
    used to control the signals are usually hidden inside enclosures called signal
    bungalows.

  zh: 一些信号由调度员控制，但许多信号是通过*轨道电路*自动运行的。在最基本的配置中，低电压电流会从区块的一端引入到轨道中。在另一端，一个继电器通过测量电流来控制附近的信号。当火车进入区块时，车轮和轴承在轨道之间形成导电路径，从而短路电路并切断继电器的电源。轨道区块之间安装了绝缘接头，以确保相邻的信号不会被无意中触发。使用非导电材料将两段轨道连接起来，同时保持它们的电气隔离。现代轨道电路甚至能够提供每列火车的位置信息和速度。用于控制信号的继电器、电子设备和电池通常被隐藏在称为信号小屋的外壳内。
- en: Beyond block signals, multiple signal heads and light combinations carrying
    various meanings add even more complexity. The busiest companies use centralized
    traffic control offices that operate like air traffic controllers to coordinate
    the schedules and routing so that conflicts are avoided. Modern traffic systems
    provide warnings and information inside the cab of each train, reducing the possibility
    of human error. In addition, the most sophisticated signal systems allow trains
    to communicate their positions to each other so the blocks can travel along with
    the train, rather than being static stretches of track on a map.

- en: Another vital element of railway traffic management is movement between tracks.
    Trains often need to pass one another, divert to destinations off the main line,
    and swap cars and compartments in rail yards. Without a way to transition between
    railways, trains would be forever stuck on a single track, making these tasks
    impossible. Switches (also known as *turnouts*) provide the means for trains to
    change tracks. The most basic type of switch uses two flexible tapered rails called
    points. The train wheels are guided in one of two directions, depending on which
    of the two points is contacting the nonmoving stock rail. A connecting rod below
    the track attaches the points to a mechanism that selects the train direction.
    Sometimes a switchstand with a lever that a rail employee must throw manually
    controls the switch. Alternatively, a dispatcher may control the switch remotely
    using an electromechanical *switch machine*.

    into two categories: passive and active. *Passive warning devices* are those that
    do not change when a train is approaching. They include a stop or yield sign and
    a crossbuck, the international symbol for a railway crossing that consists of
    two slats in an X formation. When more than one rail is present, a supplementary
    plate states the number of tracks at the intersection. A crossbuck is often included
    as a pavement marking to make sure drivers know the tracks are coming up. Many
    low-traffic grade crossings use only passive safety features. It is the driver’s
    responsibility to heed these warnings, look out for trains, and proceed only when
    it is safe to do so.'

  zh: 在许多国家，铁路平交道口会被分配一个标识符，称为平交道口编号，以简化事故和故障报告。现代铁路公司（及其监管机构）致力于公共安全，并对问题报告作出迅速响应。平交道口的安全设施通常分为两类：被动安全设施和主动安全设施。*被动警示装置*是指在列车接近时不会发生变化的警示设施，包括停车标志、让行标志和铁路平交道口的国际标志“十字架标志”（由两条交叉木条组成）。当有多个轨道时，补充板会标明交叉口处轨道的数量。十字架标志通常还会作为路面标记，以确保驾驶员知道即将到来的轨道。许多低交通量的平交道口仅使用被动安全设施。司机有责任遵守这些警示，留意列车，只有在确保安全时才可通行。
- en: '*Active warning devices* provide a visual or audible notice that a train is
    approaching. They are usually triggered by a track circuit of the same kind used
    in automatic block signaling (described in the previous section). Like railway
    signals, the relays, electronics, and batteries that control the automatic warning
    devices at grade crossings are hidden inside enclosures, often called signal bungalows.
    When a train approaches the intersection, a pair of red warning lights begins
    to flash, letting motorists know they need to stop. If the roadway has multiple
    lanes, the crossing may include a second pair of warning lights mounted overhead
    on a cantilever support. Mechanical or electronic crossing bells also provide
    an audible warning at the crossing for pedestrians or bicyclists who may not see
    the flashing lights.'

- en: In addition to lights and bells, many grade crossings include gates that drop
    across the oncoming lanes when a train crosses the roadway. The gates are equipped
    with reflective tape and lights to make them more conspicuous, even at night.
    Many intersections include a central median to discourage drivers from going around
    the gate. At the highest-risk crossings, exit gates are often installed for the
    same reason. They operate on a delay to avoid trapping a vehicle on the tracks.
    Most grade crossing gates are designed to provide a visual warning, but they aren’t
    strong enough to hold back an errant vehicle. At crossings of high-speed trains,
    a more robust *barrier gate* may be installed.

  zh: 除了灯光和铃声外，许多平交道口还配备了当列车穿越道路时会下降的栅栏。栅栏上装有反光带和灯光，以增加它们的显眼度，即使在夜间也能看见。许多交叉口设置了中央隔离带，以防止司机绕过栅栏。对于高风险交叉口，通常还会安装出口栅栏，原因相同。它们的工作方式是延时操作，以避免将车辆困在轨道上。大多数平交道口的栅栏设计用于提供视觉警示，但它们的强度不足以阻挡闯入的车辆。在高速列车经过的平交道口，可能会安装更坚固的*屏障栅栏*。
- en: One challenge with grade crossings happens in urban areas where signalized intersections
    are present near the railway. Red lights form a *queue* of vehicles that can back
    up across the tracks. You should never proceed across a railway until you know
    it’s clear on the other side. Still, drivers queueing at a traffic signal often
    misjudge the available space and find themselves inadvertently stopped right on
    top of the tracks. Traffic signals at busy intersections near grade crossings
    are usually coordinated with automatic warning devices. When a train is approaching,
    the signal goes green to clear the queue blocking the tracks.

  zh: 道口面临的一个挑战出现在城市地区，那里有信号控制的交叉口，靠近铁路。红灯会形成一条*排队*的车流，可能会倒退跨过铁轨。你绝不能在不确定另一侧清晰的情况下穿越铁路。不过，排队等红灯的司机常常会错误估计可用的空间，结果不小心停在了铁轨上。繁忙交叉口附近的交通信号通常会与自动警告装置协调配合。当火车接近时，信号灯会变绿，以清除堵塞铁轨的车流。
- en: A key consideration in the design of grade crossings is the *warning time* between
    the activation of devices and the train’s arrival at the intersection. Engineers
    need to provide enough time for vehicles to clear the tracks or stop, but not
    so much that impatient motorists assume the devices are malfunctioning and try
    to bypass the gates. People are naturally distrustful of automatic equipment,
    and that wariness is only reinforced when signals take too long to operate or
    interrupt a journey for no good reason. Engineers consider the volume and types
    of traffic, the proximity of signalized intersections, the number of tracks, and
    many other factors to strike a careful balance. The most sophisticated track circuits
    can estimate the speed of a train to make sure that warning times aren’t too long
    and can even cancel the warning if a train stops before it reaches the crossing.

  zh: 设计铁路道口时一个关键考虑因素是设备启动与火车到达交叉口之间的*警告时间*。工程师需要提供足够的时间让车辆清理道口或停车，但又不能太长，以免让不耐烦的司机认为设备出现故障，并尝试绕过栅栏门。人们天生对自动设备持怀疑态度，尤其是在信号操作缓慢或没有明显理由中断行程时，这种戒备心理会更加强烈。工程师会考虑交通流量和类型、信号交叉口的距离、铁轨数量以及其他诸多因素，以确保在安全和效率之间取得平衡。最先进的轨道电路能估算火车的速度，确保警告时间不会过长，甚至在火车停在道口前就可以取消警告。
- en: Automatic warning devices are designed to operate on the failsafe principle.
    When a malfunction or loss of power occurs, the device reverts to the safest condition
    (which is to assume a train is approaching). If power is lost, most devices have
    batteries to power the flashing lights and bells. Counterweights are carefully
    adjusted so that the gates will automatically fall when the electricity isn’t
    present to hold them up. Failsafe operation ensures that motor vehicles won’t
    inadvertently cross the tracks if there’s a problem with the warning devices.

  zh: 自动警告装置设计时遵循“故障安全”原则。当发生故障或断电时，装置会恢复到最安全的状态（即假设有火车接近）。如果电源丧失，大多数装置都有电池来为闪烁的灯光和铃声提供电力。平衡重经过精心调整，以便在没有电力支撑的情况下，栅栏门能够自动落下。故障安全操作确保了如果警告装置出现问题，机动车辆不会无意间穿越铁路。
- en: 'In addition to the crossing warning devices, locomotives provide their own
    warnings, including bells, bright headlights, and smaller flashing ditch lights.
    Most noticeably, they sound a blaring horn ahead of each grade crossing. The standard
    pattern is two long blasts, one short blast, and one final long blast. This sequence
    is either prolonged or repeated until the train reaches the crossing. If you look
    closely, you can sometimes see a whistle post beside the tracks: a short sign
    placed ahead of a grade crossing to notify the train operator when to begin sounding
    the horn. In the United States, they usually consist of a small white marker with

    in freight locomotives connect to an electric generator that powers *traction
    motors* to pull the train. Electric motors eliminate the need for massive and
    complex transmission systems that would otherwise be required to drive the wheels
    directly from an engine. With the relative simplicity of delivering electricity
    across long distances, it is natural to wonder why an onboard engine is necessary
    at all. Indeed, many railways are electrified, meaning they provide electric power

  zh: 几乎所有现代火车都使用电力驱动。即使是货运机车上的大型柴油发动机，也会连接到一个电力发电机，通过电动机为火车提供牵引力。电动机消除了直接从发动机驱动车轮所需的庞大而复杂的传动系统。由于电力可以跨越长距离相对简单地传输，许多人不禁想知道是否真的需要车载发动机。事实上，许多铁路已经实现电气化，即直接为火车提供电力驱动。
- en: Electrifying a railway has many advantages. First, trains don’t have to carry
    the weight of large engines and the enormous volume of fuel they require. They
    are generally faster and more efficient than their diesel counterparts. Removing
    the engine also removes its exhaust, improving air quality. This feature is particularly
    important for trains that run through tunnels or subway systems where engine fumes
    could concentrate to dangerous levels. Nearly all rapid transit systems use electric
    railways. Finally, electric trains are capable of regenerating electricity upon
    braking. Instead of converting the kinetic energy into wasted heat with brakes,
    the electric motors can act as generators, transforming it back into electricity
    that other trains on the railway can use. On rapid transit, where trains decelerate
    quickly, *regenerative energy* comes in short bursts, reducing its usefulness
    to other trains. However, in areas with many hills, it can be a boon. In an ideal
    situation, much of the energy a train uses to climb a large hill can be returned
    to the system as it descends to be used by other trains.

  zh: 电气化铁路有许多优势。首先，火车不需要承载大型发动机及其所需的庞大燃料。与柴油机车相比，电力驱动的火车通常速度更快、效率更高。去除发动机也去除了其排放，改善了空气质量。这个特点对于穿越隧道或地铁系统的火车尤为重要，因为在这些地方，发动机排放物可能会集中到危险水平。几乎所有的快速轨道交通系统都使用电气化铁路。最后，电动火车在刹车时能够回收电能。与其将动能转化为刹车时浪费的热量，电动机可以作为发电机，将其转化为其他火车可以使用的电能。在快速轨道交通中，由于火车迅速减速，*再生能源*通常以短时间的脉冲形式出现，导致它对其他火车的实用性降低。然而，在多丘陵的地区，这种方式可能大有裨益。在理想情况下，火车在攀爬大山时消耗的大部分能量可以在下坡时回馈给系统，供其他火车使用。
- en: There are numerous electric railway standards around the world, many of which
    have not changed for more than 100 years. Many systems use direct current because
    it’s easy to change the speed of a DC motor with simple equipment in the cab.
    However, low-voltage direct current cannot travel far in conductors without significant
    losses, so most DC railways require regularly spaced substations to convert grid
    power to direct current along the length of the track. Alternating current can
    be delivered at a higher voltage and stepped down inside a train. However, it
    is more dangerous and requires extra equipment onboard the locomotive to convert
    AC for traction motors.

    conductor that runs along the track parallel to the main rails. The energized
    rail sits atop insulators to keep it isolated from the ground. Trains are equipped
    with shoes that slide along the third rail to collect traction power. It’s a simple
    and effective system, but it does create a shock hazard for people or animals
    near the railway. Strict control of the right of way is required for safety, including

- en: The other option for delivering electricity to trains is overhead. Overhead
    lines are safer, and thus, most high-voltage systems are installed above the tracks.
    In this setup, a current collector sits atop the train. A few different devices
    can perform this task, but most modern trains employ a pantograph. They use spring-loaded
    arms to maintain contact between a replaceable graphite shoe and the overhead
    conductor. It’s a simple concept but complex in practice. Take a look at standard
    overhead electric or utility lines, and you’ll notice the challenge right away.
    They sag in the middle of the span. Maintaining contact with such large deviations
    in height between each support at high speeds would be impossible, so overhead
    railway power systems use a pair of lines to ensure reliable transfer of electricity
    to the train. The top wire, called the messenger wire, is only for support. The
    curved shape it takes between poles is called a *catenary*, so that name is often
    used to describe the whole system. From the messenger wire, vertical supports
    called drops connect the contact wire below, and that is the line on which the
    pantograph rides.

  zh: 另一种为列车提供电力的方式是通过架空线路。架空线路更为安全，因此大多数高压系统都安装在轨道上方。在这种设置中，电流收集器位于列车顶部。有几种不同的设备可以执行这一任务，但大多数现代列车采用弓形接触器。它们使用弹簧加载的臂来保持可更换的石墨鞋与架空导体之间的接触。这个概念很简单，但在实践中却非常复杂。看看标准的架空电力或公共事业线路，你会立刻注意到挑战所在。它们在跨度的中部下垂。由于在高速度下，每个支撑点之间的高度差异如此之大，因此维持接触几乎是不可能的，因此架空铁路供电系统使用一对导线，以确保电力可靠地传输到列车。顶部的导线称为信号线，仅用于支撑。它在电杆之间形成的弯曲形状称为*悬链线*，因此这个名字通常用于描述整个系统。从信号线出发，垂直支撑被称为下垂线，它们连接到下面的接触线，这就是弓形接触器所依靠的线路。
- en: The two-wire system allows the contact wire to be held at a consistent height
    along the tracks, making it possible for a pantograph to slide along it at rapid
    speeds. Both wires are energized to carry the traction current, and they are often
    kept under tension with weights suspended on pulleys on either side of the lines.
    This tension takes up slack to reduce the sag of the lines as they expand and
    contract from temperature changes. The tension also increases the speed of waves
    that travel along the wires. It makes the vibrations smaller and higher-frequency
    (just like a guitar string) to minimize bouncing, which can create electric arcs
    each time the contact wire and pantograph separate. The contact wire is held in
    a horizontal zig-zag pattern with registration arms so that the pantograph’s shoe
    wears evenly across its width.

  zh: 双导线系统使得接触线在轨道上保持一致的高度，这使得弓形接触器可以在其上以快速速度滑动。两根导线都带电以传输牵引电流，且它们通常通过悬挂在两侧滑轮上的重物保持张力。这种张力可以消除松弛，减少由于温度变化引起的导线下垂。张力还增加了沿导线传播的波速。它使得振动变得更小且频率更高（就像吉他弦一样），以减少弹跳，这样每当接触线和弓形接触器分离时，就能减少电弧的产生。接触线以水平之字形模式通过登记臂支撑，使得弓形接触器的鞋面能够均匀地磨损。
- en: An electric circuit requires a loop, so electrified railways need a second conductor
    to complete the connection. In most electrified railways, return current travels
    in the steel running rails on which the wheels roll. With a good connection to
    the earth, the voltage on the rails will stay low enough to avoid presenting a
    danger to people and animals. However, return currents create several engineering
    challenges. For one, the rails are where signal circuits typically travel. If
    the rails are carrying return current, the small track circuit signals get overwhelmed.
    Electrified railways often use AC track circuits to control the signals. Relays
    used to detect trains can be designed with filters to pick up specific frequencies
    and ignore the traction current in the rail.

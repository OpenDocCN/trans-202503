- en: A book like this can’t exist without the effort of dozens of people, either
    directly or indirectly. When I decided to publish my work in 2016, I had no idea
    just how many people would pitch in to help me finish what I started. Then I started
    thinking about all the people I really owed my career growth to over the years.
    It has made me realize it would be impossible for me to list each of you individually,
    so let me start by saying a general thank-you to everyone who has contributed
    to any of my projects over the last 20 years. The hacker community has always
    been about the open sharing of knowledge. It’s through this sharing and encouragement
    that I was able to develop the skills to be a security analyst. The organizers
    of conferences like DEF CON and local BSides events deserve a special thanks for
    all the effort they put in. Attending these events is a chance to bond with the
    members of our community and learn from one another. These events can also be
    chaotic whirlwinds behind the scenes, and organizing this chaos is no small feat!
    I’d also like to thank the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation and Daniel Trujillo at
    the Artists Rights Society for helping me navigate the licensing process for the
    Guggenheim images used in the book. I’ve never worked copyrights, but you made
    the whole process exceedingly simple, which I appreciate!

  zh: 一本像这样的书，离不开几十个人的努力，无论是直接还是间接的。当我决定在2016年出版我的作品时，我完全没有想到会有这么多人参与进来，帮助我完成我开始的事情。然后，我开始思考这些年来，我真正应该感激的那些在我职业成长中提供帮助的人们。这让我意识到，列举每一个人的名字几乎是不可能的，所以让我先对过去20年来所有为我的项目贡献过的人表示感谢。黑客社区一直以来都是开放共享知识的社区。正是通过这种共享和鼓励，我才能够发展出成为安全分析师所需的技能。像DEF
    CON和本地BSides等会议的组织者们，值得特别感谢他们为这些活动付出的努力。参加这些活动是与社区成员建立联系、相互学习的机会。这些活动背后也往往是混乱的旋风，而组织这些混乱可不是一件小事！我还要感谢Frank
    Lloyd Wright基金会以及来自艺术家权益协会的Daniel Trujillo，感谢他们帮助我处理书中使用的古根海姆图片的版权许可。我从未涉足版权工作，但你们让整个过程变得异常简单，我非常感激！
- en: I also want to say a huge thank-you to the team at No Starch Press. The time
    you’ve all put in to making my scribbles into a book is truly amazing. I never
    really understood the work it takes to produce a No Starch title, and now that
    I do, I appreciate my collection even more! Athabasca and Alex, you’ve both spent
    so much time revising my drafts that I can honestly say this book wouldn’t exist
    without you! Jill, Miles, and Rachel, you’ve all taught me so much about the editorial
    process. I cannot think of a better team of people to have supported me through
    this process.

  zh: 我还想对No Starch Press的团队表示衷心的感谢。你们为将我的涂鸦变成一本书付出了如此多的时间，真是令人惊叹。我以前从未真正理解出版一本No
    Starch书籍需要付出多少工作，而现在我明白了，我对我的收藏更加珍惜了！Athabasca和Alex，你们花了如此多的时间修订我的草稿，我可以真诚地说，这本书没有你们就根本不可能存在！Jill、Miles和Rachel，你们让我学到了如此多关于编辑过程的知识。我真无法想象还有什么更好的团队，能够在整个过程中支持我。
- en: 'In my professional life there have been a lot of people who have helped me
    grow and evolve, but my teammates at Easy Metrics deserve special recognition.
    I seriously couldn’t have accomplished any of this without all the knowledge and
    support you’ve all provided over the years we’ve known each other. Dean, Derek,
    Jessica, Josh, Owen, and Paul: you’ve each brought a special set of skills to
    the group dynamic, and I’ve learned so much from working with you over the years.
    I’m honored to count you all as colleagues and friends. Dan, you’ve been more
    than my manager; you’ve been my friend and sifu. I’ve learned more about business
    in our casual chats than most people pay a tuition for. With a team like ours,
    there’s nothing we can’t accomplish! Jay, what can I say other than thank you
    for everything, from teaching me how to run product development and encouraging
    me to take my security research more seriously, to being my sounding board for
    wild ideas and helping me rein them in just the right amount. You’re a great mentor
    and friend, and there’s always a spot open for you at my campfire.'

  zh: 在我的职业生涯中，有很多人帮助我成长和进步，但我的Easy Metrics团队特别值得表扬。如果没有你们多年来提供的知识和支持，我根本无法完成这些成就。Dean、Derek、Jessica、Josh、Owen和Paul：你们每个人都为团队带来了独特的技能，我从你们身上学到了很多东西。能把你们当作同事和朋友，我感到非常荣幸。Dan，你不仅是我的经理，更是我的朋友和师父。我在我们轻松的聊天中学到了比大多数人上学费还要多的商业知识。有了像我们这样的团队，什么都不可能做不到！Jay，除了感谢你为我做的一切，我还能说什么呢？从教我如何进行产品开发、鼓励我认真对待我的安全研究，到成为我疯狂想法的倾诉对象，帮助我适度地控制这些想法，你都是我伟大的导师和朋友，在我的篝火旁永远为你留一个位置。
- en: On a personal note, there are a couple of people who have given so much of their
    time, energy, knowledge, love, and encouragement that I want to let them know
    how important they’ve been. Tony and Bam, my lawyer advised me that I cannot thank
    you for specific events that may implicate anyone in that thing that time, but
    you know. You’re more than just my closest friends; you’re the family that I needed
    when I needed it the most. Plus, I’ve learned more about security from hanging
    out with you two than any course, class, or book could ever hope to teach. In
    a lot of ways, this is all your fault!

  zh: 在个人方面，有几位人士为我投入了大量的时间、精力、知识、爱和鼓励，我想让他们知道他们对我有多么重要。Tony和Bam，我的律师告诉我，我不能感谢你们在某些事件上给予的帮助，因为那可能涉及到当时某些事情的相关人，但你们知道的。你们不仅是我最亲密的朋友，你们是我在最需要的时候所需要的家庭。而且，和你们两个一起消磨时光，我学到的安全知识远超过任何课程、班级或书本所能教给我的。在很多方面，这一切都要怪你们！
- en: Finally, the biggest thanks goes to my girlfriend and kids for putting up with
    me. I know I can be a lot to absorb at times. You’ve been subjected to impromptu
    math lectures and dragged to security conferences, or left at home when I traveled
    to one. You take care of literally everything while I get lost in weeks-long coding
    projects. You’ve done everything possible to support me through my career, and
    I love you all.

  zh: 最后，最大的感谢要给我的女朋友和孩子们，感谢你们的包容。我知道有时我可能让你们感到难以承受。你们曾经被迫听我即兴的数学讲座，或者在我去参加安全大会时被留在家里。每当我沉浸在数周的编程项目中时，都是你们照顾了所有的一切。你们为我的事业做出了所有可能的支持，我爱你们所有人。

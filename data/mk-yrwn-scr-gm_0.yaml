    scary. We enjoy playing games because they act like windows into other worlds,
    worlds that move and change as we play with them, worlds whose rules are different
    than our own. (Sometimes these rules seem to make more sense than our world’s.)
    Games can be places we visit for a short time or places we get lost in for long
    stretches at a time. Through games, we can try on other personas and explore different
    perspectives.

    3D movies. It seems like people were born to *play*. Whenever a group of people

    on to new players, the new group puts its unique spin on it. For example, a *Tag*

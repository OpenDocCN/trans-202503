- en: Chaos erupted on the deck as the thugs danced away from the wash of pickling
    juices and sliding eels. A second barrel landed a moment later, sending out a
    fresh wave. The eels, Deepwater Longbacks by the look of them, measured around
    four feet from end to end and threatened to trip and tangle, not to mention disgust.
    A group of three thugs fell into a heap as they tried to escape the splash zone.

  zh: 当腌制汁液和滑动的鳗鱼溅到甲板时，混乱爆发了，恶棍们跳开了。一桶腌汁随之落下，激起了新一轮的波涛。从鳗鱼的外观来看，它们是深水长背鳗，每条大约有四英尺长，令人既想绊倒又想纠缠，更别提那种恶心的感觉了。一群三个恶棍试图逃避溅射区时跌成一团。

  zh: “不知道，”弗兰克说道。“但现在是我们的机会。走这边！”
- en: He pulled Notation toward the railing at the ship’s edge, sliding through the
    puddles of pickling juices and piles of eels. A fourth barrel hit the deck and
    sent the thugs scurrying again. The deck was beginning to look like a grotesque
    bowl heaped with long, pale gray noodles.

  zh: 他拉着诺塔申朝船边的栏杆走去，踩过腌制汁液的水洼和鳗鱼堆。第四桶落到甲板上，恶棍们再次四散逃开。甲板开始看起来像是一个堆满长长的、苍白灰色面条的怪异碗。
- en: Alongside the ship bobbed a small, nondescript, but oddly familiar schooner
    loaded with more barrels. A teenage boy, dressed in wizard’s robes, was rolling
    a new barrel onto a contraption composed of planks.

  zh: 船旁边漂浮着一艘小型、不起眼，但奇异熟悉的双桅帆船，船上装满了更多的桶。一个穿着巫师长袍的少年正在将新的一桶滚到由木板组成的装置上。

  zh: “我们应该跳过去，”诺塔申说。
- en: “Jump,” agreed Frank, eyeing the other ship. He didn’t recognize the boy but
    figured that he must be an enemy of the Vinettees. Nobody in their right mind
    would fling pickled eels at the Vinettees unless they were already at war. Then
    again, very few people in their right mind would chose eels as a weapon under
    any circumstance.

  zh: “跳吧，”弗兰克同意道，目光盯着另一艘船。他没认出那个男孩，但猜测他一定是维内提人的敌人。除非他们已经开战，否则没人会在理智的情况下把腌制的鳗鱼扔向维内提人。再说了，理智的人在任何情况下都不可能选择鳗鱼作为武器。
- en: Notation nodded, pulled herself onto the railing, and jumped without hesitation.
    She sailed through the air, clearing the gap easily, and landed on the schooner’s
    deck.

  zh: 诺塔申点点头，毫不犹豫地跳上了栏杆。她轻松地跃过间隙，稳稳地落在了双桅帆船的甲板上。
- en: Frank pulled himself up onto the railing, muttered a handful of Boolean curse
    words, and hesitated again as he balanced on the wooden beam. Then, after counting
    to three a few times, he jumped. Frank missed the schooner by two feet and plunged
    into the freezing water. He surfaced in time to see another barrel soar overhead.
    He paused briefly to wonder if the boy was still flinging eels or whether he had
    moved onto something else—soft cheeses, perhaps.

  zh: 弗兰克爬上了栏杆，低声咒骂了一堆布尔值的脏话，在木梁上犹豫了一下。然后，他数了几次到三，终于跳了下去。弗兰克差了两英尺没跳到双桅帆船，跌入了冰冷的水中。他浮出水面，刚好看到另一桶从头顶飞过。他稍微停顿了一下，心想那个男孩还在继续扔鳗鱼吗，还是换了别的东西——比如软奶酪。
- en: Notation reached down and pulled him onto the ship. He got to his feet and began
    wringing out his cloak while he assessed their new situation. The teenager was
    continuing his barrage of the *Retry Loop*. Sailors hurried around the deck, pushing
    the smaller ship away from the *Retry Loop* with long wooden poles.

  zh: 诺塔申伸手把他拉上了船。他站起来，开始拧干他的披风，同时评估他们的新处境。那个少年还在继续向*重试循环*发动攻击。水手们在甲板上忙碌，拿着长木杆推开那艘小船，远离*重试循环*。

  zh: “梅维斯？”弗兰克大声叫道。“我知道你就在这儿某个地方。”

    pointing at the teenager. “It’s up to him how he wants to unload it.”

    month they stole one of my caches—17 bushels of carrots!”

  zh: 梅维斯挥手示意他不要再说了。“反正我欠维内提人一个人情，”她解释道。“上个月他们偷走了我的一个藏匿点——17蒲式耳的胡萝卜！”

    business. A hundred bushels of carrots wouldn’t be close to worth it.
  id: totrans-18

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: Frank 目瞪口呆地盯着她。与 Vinettees 作对是件危险的事。一百车篓的胡萝卜也远远不值这个。
- en: “Don’t look at me like that, Frank,” she said. “I’m not doing this out of the
    goodness of my heart. It’s a paid contract. Simple as that. Socks made it worth
    my while.”

    In my business, you don’t press for real names.”

  zh: Mavis 朝那个男孩示意，然后耸了耸肩。“那是他自己叫的名字。在我的行业里，你不能要求知道真实姓名。”

    Notation. Mavis gave her a skeptical look.

  zh: “你在让他登船之前没有要求出示正式身份证明吗？”Notation 问道。Mavis 投给她一个怀疑的目光。
- en: By now, Mavis’s crew had gotten the *TCP Flyer* turned around, and they were
    heading out to sea. Dirty sails were hoisted into the air, blocking Socks’s barrel
    throwing. He took a last long look at the *Retry Loop*, smiled, and turned finally
    to Frank.

  zh: 到现在为止，Mavis 的船员已经将 *TCP Flyer* 转向，他们正驶向大海。脏污的帆被升到空中，挡住了 Socks 投掷桶的视线。他最后长时间地看了一眼
    *Retry Loop*，微笑着，最终转向 Frank。

    Frank shook it warily.

  zh: “嗨，”他说得异常欢快，“我是 Socks。”他伸出手。Frank 小心翼翼地和他握手。

    She eyed him beadily, then, apparently unsatisfied with the subtlety of her approach,
    followed with, “What’s your real name, Socks?”

  zh: “谢谢你救了我们，*Socks*，”Notation 也伸出手和他握手。她眼神锐利地打量着他，然后显然对自己这种微妙的方式不满意，于是接着问道，“Socks，你的真名是什么？”

    name is Socks Repellent, Officer.”

  zh: “不幸的是，那确实是我的真名，”Socks 有些伤感地回答道。“我的全名是 Socks Repellent，警官。”

    for such a misfortune, she repeated, “Thank you for saving us.”
  id: totrans-28

  zh: “哦……”Notation 没有继续下去。显然未能找到合适的安慰来应对这样的不幸，她重复道，“谢谢你救了我们。”

    I’m glad it worked.”

    we needed help?”

    one of the police department thefts, right? I saw Captain Donovan visit Frank
    last night, so I assumed it had something to do with the one at headquarters.”
  id: totrans-40

    in.
  id: totrans-43

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “为什么巫师们关心从警察局偷盗的事？”Frank 插话道。

    kingdom’s most senior and respected wizards to investigate a theft. I’m Gretchen’s
    apprentice, of course. It’s only my second year, but—”
  id: totrans-44

  zh: “国王召集了他们。几周前，Fredrick 国王召集了一些王国最资深和受人尊敬的巫师调查一起盗窃案件。我当然是 Gretchen 的学徒。虽然只有第二年，但——”
- en: “Why did he call in senior wizards?” Frank interrupted again. Gretchen wasn’t
    a name he’d heard before. Evidently, the more powerful wizards had been occupied
    with more pressing tasks, and the king had worked his way down the list, but Frank
    didn’t want to embarrass the boy by questioning his mentor’s seniority.
  id: totrans-45

  zh: “为什么他要召集高级巫师？”Frank再次打断道。Gretchen这个名字他之前没有听过。显然，实力更强的巫师们已经被更紧急的任务占据，而国王只能按名单往下走，但Frank不想因为质疑导师的资历让孩子难堪。
- en: “The Capital Police are well equipped to handle thefts,” added Notation. “It
    should be their investigation.”

    important investigation. If you have information that would help in this case,
    it is your duty to provide it. Please tell us everything.”

  zh: “从头开始说，”Frank补充道。
- en: It took 10 minutes for Socks to finish his excessively detailed story concerning
    a monthlong crime spree in which a multitude of unrelated items were stolen from
    secure locations. The most disturbing revelation involved the theft of a dangerous
    magical artifact, an enchanted mask, from a military convoy. When pressed for
    details on what the mask did or why it needed an armed escort, Socks would only
    repeat that it was “extremely powerful.” The awe in his voice made Frank nervous.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 经过10分钟，Socks终于讲完了他那段过于详细的故事，内容是关于一场持续一个月的犯罪狂潮，期间大量无关的物品从安全的地方被盗走。最让人不安的揭示是，盗贼从一支军队护送的车队中偷走了一件危险的魔法物品——一副魔法面具。当被追问面具的功能或为何需要武装护送时，Socks只会重复说那是“极其强大的”。他语气中的敬畏让Frank感到不安。
- en: “You think this theft is related to the one at the police station?” asked Notation.
  id: totrans-54
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “你认为这次盗窃与警察局的盗窃案件有关联吗？”Notation问道。
- en: “Gretchen thinks so,” Socks answered. “In every case, the guards were completely
    unaware that a theft had occurred until the next day. She thinks the thief used
    a memory spell or a sleep charm.”
  id: totrans-55
  prefs: []

  zh: “Gretchen也是这么认为的，”Socks回答道，“在每个案件中，警卫们直到第二天才发现盗窃事件发生。她认为小偷使用了记忆法术或睡眠咒语。”

    away.

    about it didn’t add up. “Why tail us?” he asked finally. “You’re on an investigation
    sanctioned by the king himself, right? You could have just walked up and introduced
    yourself.”

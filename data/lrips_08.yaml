- en: Permute was a small village not far from Symbol. Hugh Rustic’s shop was easy
    to find. Its sign was even bigger and fancier than Tinker’s.

  zh: Permute是一个离Symbol不远的小村庄。Hugh Rustic的店很容易找到，它的招牌比Tinker的还大还花哨。

- en: “Hello, Mister Rustic?” Laurie called as she stepped inside the shop. “Mister
    Tinker back in Symbol owes me an algorithm, and he said I should talk to you about
    it.”

  zh: “你好，Rustic先生？”Laurie走进商店时叫道，“Symbol的Mister Tinker欠我一个算法，他说我应该来找你谈。”
- en: Rustic was a tall, loud, messy-looking man with a big red beard. He didn’t look
    anything like the elegant Eponymous or the neat and proper Tinker.

  zh: Rustic是一个高大、声音大、看起来有些邋遢的男人，留着一大把红胡子。他看起来完全不像优雅的Eponymous或者整洁得体的Tinker。

    had recommended him, so Laurie handed him the IOU.

  zh: 他看起来完全不像Laurie认为的作曲家应该的样子！不过Tinker推荐了他，所以Laurie把欠条交给了他。

    me?”

  zh: “我，我是想找一条穿过所有城镇的最短路径。你能帮我吗？”

    miss. Improbable we can do right away. Impossible, by Tuesday at the latest.”

  zh: “太棒了！有趣！”Rustic说道，“Tinker把你送到对的地方了，小姐。*不可能*我们立刻就做完。*不可能*，最迟到周二。”
- en: “But if it’s impossible—” Laurie began.

  zh: “只能说是*不可能*，”Rustic纠正道。
- en: “If it’s *improbable*, how do you do it?”
  id: totrans-12
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “如果是*不可能*，那你怎么做呢？”
- en: “By shifting your point of view,” said Rustic. “Instead of looking for an answer
    that fits your problem, you imagine an *answer* and look for a problem to fit
    it.”
  id: totrans-13

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “通过改变你的视角，”Rustic说道，“不是去寻找一个适合你问题的答案，而是先想一个*答案*，然后去寻找一个适合它的问题。”
- en: “But you can’t just change the problem, can you?”
  id: totrans-14
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “但你不能随便改变问题，对吧？”
- en: “Why, of course you can! Worrying about the problem is a waste of time! What
    you really want is an answer, right?”
  id: totrans-15

  zh: “当然可以！担心问题是在浪费时间！你真正想要的是答案，对吧？”

- en: “Well, I . . . what?”
  id: totrans-18

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “嗯，我……什么？”
- en: “Let’s say you’re at the market. You want the best, most perfect tomato. But
    to find the *best* tomato, you’d have to compare them all, right? You’d look at
    each and every one, turn it around, maybe squeeze it a bit. For every tomato in
    the whole market.”
  id: totrans-19
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “假设你在市场上。你想要最好的、最完美的西红柿。但是为了找到*最好的*西红柿，你必须比较它们，对吧？你得看看每一个，把它转过来，可能还得捏一捏。每一个西红柿都得这么做。”
- en: “No one does that!” said Laurie. “Well, old Mrs. Harris *does* do that. But
    my mom says she’s a little batty. I just pick a good one.”
  id: totrans-20
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “没有人这么做！”Laurie说，“嗯，Harris老太太*确实*这么做。但我妈妈说她有点疯狂。我只是挑个好的。”
- en: “See? You already know how to do things the Hugh Rustic way. You don’t waste
    your time looking for the *best* tomato when there are plenty that are Good Enough.”
  id: totrans-21
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “看吧？你已经知道怎么用Hugh Rustic的方法做事了。当有很多‘足够好’的西红柿时，你就不浪费时间去找*最好的*西红柿。”
- en: “So instead of trying to find the *shortest* path through all of the towns in
    Userland,” Laurie said, “we look for one that’s short *enough*?”
  id: totrans-22
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “所以，我们不是试图找出穿过所有Userland城镇的*最短*路径，”Laurie说道，“而是找一个*足够短*的路径？”
- en: “Why not?” asked Rustic. “Out of all the zippity-million paths, I bet there
    are a whole lot that are pretty short. You need to find only *one* of them, and
    that’s much easier.”
  id: totrans-23
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “为什么不呢？”Rustic问，“在所有那些快得不得了的路径中，我敢打赌，有很多路径是相当短的。你只需要找到*一个*就行了，这要容易得多。”
- en: Rustic pulled out a large map and placed it on the counter.
  id: totrans-24

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: Rustic拿出一张大地图，放在柜台上。
- en: “Here is where we are,” he said, pointing to Permute, “and this is where you
    started, am I right? Let’s put some pencils here to stand in for Mount Upper Bound,
    and a little spoon there for Lower Bound Valley.” The map also had markers for
    Bach and Recursion Junction, as well as many other places Laurie hadn’t been to
    yet.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “这里就是我们的位置，”他说着，指向Permute，“这就是你出发的地方，对吧？让我们在这里放上几根铅笔，代表Upper Bound山，而那边放个小勺子代表Lower
    Bound Valley。”地图上还有Bach和Recursion Junction的标记，以及Laurie还没去过的很多地方。
- en: “Now for the fun part,” said Rustic. “Let’s ask the ants.”
  id: totrans-26

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “现在是有趣的部分，”Rustic说道，“让我们去问蚂蚁。”
- en: “Ask the *ants*? What are you talking about? Ants can’t read maps!” Laurie said.
    At the mention of insects, Xor was suddenly alert.
  id: totrans-27
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “让*蚂蚁*来做？你在说什么呢？蚂蚁不能读地图！”Laurie说。提到昆虫，Xor突然警觉起来。
- en: “Who says they can’t? Next you’ll try to tell me that turtles can’t draw circles,”
    Rustic said.
  id: totrans-28

  zh: “谁说它们做不到？接下来你是不是要告诉我乌龟也不会画圆圈？”Rustic说道。
- en: “So you teach the ants to read maps?”
  id: totrans-29
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “所以你是教蚂蚁读地图？”
- en: “Not exactly. Ants are good at finding their way home already. The idea is to
    get them to work for us.” He opened a jar of honey and put a tiny daub of the
    sweet stuff on each town.
  id: totrans-30
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “不完全是。蚂蚁本来就擅长找到回家的路。关键是让它们为我们工作。”他打开一瓶蜂蜜，在每个小镇上涂上一点甜蜜的蜂蜜。
- en: A minute passed. Nothing happened. Then a little ant crawled onto the table.
    It smelled the honey and zig-zagged its way onto the map. It nibbled from one
    bit of honey, then wandered around until it walked into another one.
  id: totrans-31
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 一分钟过去了。什么也没发生。然后，一只小蚂蚁爬上了桌子。它闻到了蜂蜜的气味，沿着地图蜿蜒而行。它从一块蜂蜜上舔了一点，然后四处游荡，直到走到了另一块蜂蜜上。

- en: “When an ant finds food, she leaves a little scent message for the others that
    come after her,” Rustic said. “Ants follow the scent of food and also the scent
    of other ants. Lots of ants can try lots of different paths at the same time.
    Eventually they’ll settle on a quick route to all of the food and back to their
    nest.”
  id: totrans-33

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “当一只蚂蚁找到食物时，它会留下一个小小的气味信息，供后来的蚂蚁跟随，”Rustic说。“蚂蚁会跟随食物的气味，也会跟随其他蚂蚁的气味。很多蚂蚁可以同时尝试多条不同的路径，最终它们会找到一条快速的路线，带着食物回到巢穴。”
- en: The first ant continued on to Bach. Another appeared and went directly to Recursion
    Junction instead. Still others went all the way across to Probability Bay, Permute,
    Notation, and other towns. Soon the map had dozens of ants going every which way,
    collecting bits of honey and leaving scents for their sisters.
  id: totrans-34
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 第一只蚂蚁继续前进，走向巴赫（Bach）。另一只蚂蚁出现了，直接走向递归交汇点（Recursion Junction）。还有一些蚂蚁穿越到概率湾（Probability
    Bay）、排列（Permute）、符号（Notation）以及其他小镇。很快，地图上就有数十只蚂蚁四处走动，收集蜂蜜并留下气味供它们的姐妹们跟随。
- en: After a few minutes it was clear that some paths were more popular than others.
    The lines of ants got wider and wider, until there was just one ant superhighway
    that marched all around the map and back to the nest. Hugh Rustic copied it to
    a piece of paper before the honey disappeared.

  zh: 几分钟后，很明显有些路径比其他的更受欢迎。蚂蚁的队伍越来越宽，直到最后只剩下一条蚂蚁超级高速公路，绕着地图一圈又一圈，回到了巢穴。Hugh Rustic在蜂蜜消失之前，将这条路径画了下来。
- en: “Ah, there you go!” he said, handing Laurie his sketch.
  id: totrans-36

  zh: “啊，就是这个！”他说着，把他的草图递给了Laurie。
- en: “Thank you, Mister Rustic! Is this really the shortest way?”

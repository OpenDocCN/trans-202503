  zh: G1 接待
- en: The G1 didn’t overtake the iPhone in sales, didn’t become a worldwide best-seller,
    and didn’t become the phone that everyone had to have.

  zh: G1 并没有超越 iPhone 的销量，没有成为全球热销产品，也没有成为每个人都必须拥有的手机。
- en: The reviews shared the opinion that it was . . . interesting. The hardware wasn’t
    awful, although the screen was quite small. It didn’t support video recording.
    And there were not many must-have applications beyond the pre-installed Google
    apps.

  zh: 评测普遍认为它是...有趣的。硬件并不差，虽然屏幕确实很小。它不支持视频录制。而且除了预装的 Google 应用外，并没有很多必备应用。
- en: On the Android team, too, the reception was mixed. As Fadden said, “The G1 was
    right on the edge of good but was a bit lumpy and awkward.”

  zh: 在 Android 团队中，反响也是褒贬不一。正如 Fadden 所说，“G1 几乎达到了好的边界，但它有点笨拙、不流畅。”
- en: 'Dan Egnor agreed: “It was kind of this enthusiast device. Some people were
    excited about it, but in many ways, it was kind of a crappy device. It showed
    a lot of potential. But for somebody to adopt it? It wasn’t exactly flying off
    the shelves.”'

  zh: Dan Egnor 同意：“它有点像一个爱好者设备。有些人对此很兴奋，但在很多方面，它其实是个挺差的设备。它显示了很大的潜力。但要让某些人去采纳它？它并不是那种一上架就飞
    off 的东西。”
- en: 'Dave Burke talked about the G1: “The impression was: ‘Wow, this thing is sophisticated,
    it can do a lot. If anything . . . it can do almost too much.’ It had a keyboard
    and it had a trackpad and a rollerball and touch. It had everything. All these
    sensors. You got a feeling initially that Android was trying to do everything.
    I remember thinking at the time, What’s going to survive? Is the keyboard and
    the touchscreen going to survive? Is that trackball really going to be the thing?
    There was recognition that this thing was super-powerful, but total uncertainty
    that it might have been a one-off and flopped. It wasn’t clear to people.”'

  zh: Dave Burke 讲述了 G1：“给人的印象是：‘哇，这东西真是很复杂，能做很多事。如果说有什么问题...那就是它做得几乎太多了。’它有一个键盘，一个触控板，一个滚珠鼠标和触摸屏。它几乎什么都有。所有这些传感器。一开始你会感觉，Android
    似乎想做一切。我记得当时在想，什么功能会存活下来？是键盘和触摸屏会存活吗？那个滚珠鼠标真的会成为关键吗？大家都意识到这个东西非常强大，但也完全不确定它可能只是昙花一现，最终会失败。大家并不清楚。”
- en: Dianne said, “The G1 was definitely an everything-and-the-kitchen-sink device . .
    . which as a general consumer product, is not the best thing in the world. But
    it was good for the platform since we had to support all of that stuff.” So while
    it might not have created the best consumer experience for a phone,^([1](#c42-footnote-1))
    it paved the way for a myriad of follow-on devices that were able to take advantage
    of the myriad of capabilities that the platform provided.

  zh: Dianne 说：“G1 绝对是一个‘什么都要有’的设备...作为一个普通消费品，这可不是最好的东西。但它对平台来说是好的，因为我们必须支持所有这些东西。”所以，虽然它可能没有为手机创造最佳的消费者体验，^([1](#c42-footnote-1))它为随后的一系列设备铺平了道路，这些设备能够利用平台提供的各种功能。
- en: 'Holiday sales are the biggest time of year for new devices. Dan Egnor remembered
    that first holiday with the G1: “Michael Morrissey [manager of the services team]
    had bad memories of Christmas day spikes [from Danger], and nobody on the team
    being available while things were melting down. So he was like, ‘We’re gonna have
    an on-call coverage that day. We’re gonna have a War Room. Who’s gonna be around?
    Big sacrifice, working Christmas Day. . . . ‘I was like, I’ll do this, sure.’
    And then nothing happened. We had more activations than a typical day, but there
    wasn’t even a particularly large spike.”'

  zh: 假日销售是新设备一年中最重要的时期。Dan Egnor 记得与 G1 一起度过的第一个假日：“Michael Morrissey [服务团队经理] 记得圣诞节那天的高峰[来自
    Danger]，那时团队里没人可用，事情一团糟。所以他就说，‘我们那天要安排值班。我们要设立一个战情室。谁能在那儿？大牺牲，圣诞节当天工作……’我就说，‘我来吧，没问题。’结果什么都没发生。我们活跃度比平常多，但并没有出现特别大的激增。”
- en: So the G1 wasn’t an immediate overnight triumph. But there was promise.

  zh: 所以，G1 并没有成为一夜之间的胜利。但它有潜力。
- en: It was decent enough for people to take the phone seriously. And it was purchased
    in real, if not overwhelming, numbers. T-Mobile reported^([2](#c42-footnote-2))
    that it had reached sales of over a million units in the US six months later.
    This was, coincidentally, the number of devices needed in that timeframe to convince
    the Google networking team to not take back its dedicated VIP resource^([3](#c42-footnote-3))
    from the Android services team, which would have caused serious problems for all
    of the Google apps on Android.

  zh: 它足够让人们认真看待这款手机。并且它的销量虽然不算压倒性，但还是达到了真实的数字。T-Mobile报告^([2](#c42-footnote-2))称，六个月后，它在美国的销量已超过一百万部。这恰好是那个时间框架内，谷歌网络团队需要的设备数量，以说服他们不收回原本为Android服务团队配备的专门VIP资源^([3](#c42-footnote-3))，否则这将给所有Android上的谷歌应用带来严重问题。
- en: The G1 also provided a decent enough experience for people to take Android seriously
    as a platform. Android had finally been released out into the world. People were
    able to use the device and the platform to do what they needed to do, and that
    was good enough for now. Consumers could take Android seriously as a phone, and
    potential partners could take Android seriously as a platform. It allowed manufacturers
    to see that Android was real and that they could use it to build their own devices,
    which would eventually be more interesting and more powerful than that initial
    G1.

  zh: G1也为人们认真看待Android平台提供了足够的体验。Android终于发布到世界上了。人们能够使用设备和平台完成他们需要做的事情，这对于当时来说已经足够好了。消费者可以把Android当作手机来认真对待，潜在的合作伙伴也可以把Android当作平台来认真对待。这使得制造商看到Android是真实存在的，他们可以利用它来打造自己的设备，这些设备最终将比最初的G1更有趣、更强大。
- en: 'Hiroshi said, “The G1 made Android. Commercially, G1 wasn’t a huge success.
    The G1 was good but wasn’t a huge volume driver and didn’t really get that much
    attention outside of the tech industry. But launching it made it real for the
    OEMs: ‘OK these people can actually ship. It’s a real thing. It’s not vaporware.’
    By the time G1 launched, we were already in discussions with all the major OEMs,
    who eventually became our partners.”'

  zh: Hiroshi说：“G1造就了Android。从商业上来说，G1并不是一个巨大的成功。G1不错，但并没有成为巨大的销量驱动者，也没有在科技行业之外引起太多关注。但它的发布让OEM厂商看到了Android的真实存在：‘好吧，这些人实际上能够发布产品。这是一个真实的东西，不是空中楼阁。’到G1发布时，我们已经和所有主要的OEM厂商展开了讨论，最终他们成了我们的合作伙伴。”

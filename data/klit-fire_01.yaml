- en: In the summer of 2016, I found myself sitting in front of the weirdest system
    I had ever encountered as a software engineer. There was a fairly banal web application
    written in Java that was connecting to what I would eventually figure out was
    a mainframe. The mainframe itself wasn’t the weird part. When you venture into
    the world of legacy modernization, you quickly realize that mainframes are still
    *everywhere*—in banks, in government, buried deep in the foundation of civil society.
    Having a web application send requests to a mainframe wasn’t so weird. I had a
    hard time accepting that a technology designed for bulk transactions would respond
    quickly enough to meet the demands of a website at a reasonable scale, but despite
    my concerns, it did appear to be doing okay.

  zh: 2016年夏天，我坐在了作为软件工程师所遇到的最奇怪的系统面前。那是一个用Java编写的相当普通的Web应用程序，它连接到我最终会弄明白的是一台大型机。大型机本身并不奇怪。当你进入遗留系统现代化的领域时，你很快会意识到大型机仍然*无处不在*——在银行、政府机构中，深藏于民间社会的基础设施中。让一个Web应用程序向大型机发送请求并不奇怪。我曾难以接受一项为大宗交易设计的技术能够足够快速地响应，以满足一个网站在合理规模下的需求，但尽管我有担忧，它似乎还是能做得不错。

    storing data on magnetic tape. There was no way *that* mainframe could respond
    quickly enough, so when I saw this on the architecture diagrams, I focused on
    a group of mysterious machines that were sitting in the middle; a modern web application
    was on one side and an ancient mainframe on the other.

    organization used for it. Nobody on the engineering teams I was working with seemed
    to know what the machines did. It took a lot of digging through several decades
    of documentation before I figured out what they were: *Unisys ClearPath Dorados*.
    In other words, they were more mainframes, newer ones, that were effectively configured
    like a cache in front of the old mainframe. That was how 60-year-old code was
    responding fast enough to serve requests from the modern internet. The organization
    had a new machine sitting in between that was storing a temporary copy of the
    relevant data. About once a week, the new mainframes would request an update from
    the older mainframe.'

    languages are different. On this point, the engineer added another interesting

    a calendar, keeping notes, reading the news, and viewing stock prices. Despite

- en: Mainframes in their heyday existed in a world where processor power was limited.
    Having enough of it to make offloading calculations to a machine required investing
    in a whole room full of equipment and specialized operators, which were expensive.
    The market invested heavily in making the hardware faster. The lowest-hanging
    fruit in that endeavor was actually just making the chips smaller so you could
    pack more of them into the same machine. Doing this did not immediately result
    in smaller mainframes, but rather it expanded the market to capture different
    price points so that large organizations would still pay millions of dollars,
    while small organizations could be persuaded to pay tens of thousands to have
    mainframes of their own. This exposed computers to a larger audience and stimulated
    the market for what eventually became the PC. Even still, there wasn’t any need
    to make improvements to network speeds, because the computers were slow and couldn’t
    store much data. A supercomputer in 1985, for example, had about as much processing
    power as an early-generation iPhone. A more typical computer from that era might
    have a few hundred kilobytes of RAM and storage. The National Science Foundation
    Network, which would eventually become the backbone of the early internet, offered
    56kbps in the 1980s. At that speed, it would have taken only about an hour to
    transfer an entire computer’s worth of data across the network.

  zh: 在黄金时代，主机存在于一个处理器能力有限的世界里。为了将计算卸载到机器上，足够的处理能力需要投资一个充满设备和专业操作员的房间，这些都非常昂贵。市场在加速硬件提升上投入了大量资金。在这一过程中，最简单的办法其实是让芯片变得更小，这样你就可以在同一台机器上塞入更多的芯片。这样做并没有立即导致主机变得更小，而是将市场扩展到不同的价格区间，让大型组织仍然愿意支付数百万美元，而小型组织则能够被说服支付几万美元来拥有属于自己的主机。这让计算机接触到了更广泛的受众，并刺激了最终变成个人电脑的市场。即便如此，仍然没有必要提升网络速度，因为计算机很慢，存储能力也有限。举个例子，1985年的超级计算机的处理能力大致相当于早期的iPhone。一台那个时代的典型计算机可能只有几百KB的RAM和存储空间。国家科学基金会网络，后来成为早期互联网的骨干，在1980年代提供56kbps的速度。以这个速度，传输一台计算机的全部数据大约只需要一个小时。
- en: Eventually, decades of engineering work changed that relationship. Faster, more
    powerful computers were now waiting for their data to come across the network.
    More and more of these machines were smaller and cheaper with endlessly growing
    storage capacity. As the number of machines increased, the load on their networks
    also increased. The more computers connected to a network at the same time, the
    slower the network becomes. It was going to take time for the demands for more
    speed to produce a market response, so the industry optimized by shifting toward
    applications that stored more data locally on the machine itself. We walked away
    from applications that run on a centralized computer that we communicated with
    across a network. If we don’t need to move data across the network, network speed
    doesn’t hold us back.

    was itself a significant engineering challenge. In fact, many national computer
    network projects were attempted during the same period as the internet. The United
    Kingdom had one; France had two; the Soviet Union had three failed attempts. The
    United States ultimately prevailed because it was not trying to build a national
    network; it was simply trying to solve compatibility issues caused by all the
    proprietary standards computer manufacturers were pushing. The US military had
    funded a number of expensive computers, and it wanted research institutions hundreds
    of miles away from one another to be able to share those resources. Had it been

    companies to compete by making connections faster. The faster the internet became,
    the more people put on it. The more content that was on the internet, the more
    consumers started logging on. The more people trying to access a given resource
    on the internet, the more expensive hosting those resources on your own machines

- en: 'The factors that influence shifts are also fractal and interdisciplinary in
    nature. The reason American internet service providers (ISPs) settled on a flat-rate
    pricing structure early on is that the landscape offered them two options for
    building the network of communication lines necessary to be in business in the
    first place: either they built their own links or they rented other people’s links.
    In the latter category, a wide variety of options were available, not just existing
    telecom networks built for the telephone, like AT&T, but also private lines maintained
    by large institutions to connect their data centers. A company like AOL in the
    1990s was both in competition with telecoms to sell internet access and a customer
    of those same telecoms. This made ISPs much more sensitive to customer feedback
    and the psychological draw of simple, flat pricing a necessity.^([11](#c01-footnote-11))
    Among other things, charging for usage levels means services grow more expensive
    as they get worse. More activity by more users ultimately leads to congestion
    and degrades network performance. The fact that users have trouble correctly estimating
    their usage levels and that the majority of them pay more with flat prices further
    incentivized the industry. If you want a quick demonstration of that, look up
    your real cellular data usage and compare it to what limits you are paying for

  zh: 影响变动的因素本质上也是分形的、跨学科的。美国互联网服务提供商（ISP）早期选择固定费用定价结构的原因在于，市场环境提供了两种选择来建立通信线路网络，这对于他们开展业务至关重要：要么自己建设线路，要么租用他人的线路。在后者这一类别中，存在多种选择，不仅包括像AT&T这样的为电话服务建立的现有电信网络，还包括大型机构为连接其数据中心而维护的专线。像90年代的AOL这样的公司，既与电信公司竞争出售互联网接入服务，又是这些电信公司的客户。这使得ISP对客户反馈更加敏感，而简单、固定定价的心理吸引力变得必不可少^([11](#c01-footnote-11))。其中，按使用量收费意味着服务在变差时变得更加昂贵。更多用户的活跃最终会导致拥塞，进而影响网络性能。用户难以准确估算自己的使用量，而大多数用户在固定价格下支付的费用更高，这进一步刺激了该行业。如果你想快速验证这一点，可以查看你实际的手机数据使用量，并与每月支付的流量限制进行对比。大多数用户从未接近耗尽流量。
- en: In Europe, it was far more common for telecoms to be government-run, which meant
    less competition forcing simpler pricing models. The European Union would eventually
    liberalize the internet market in the late 1990s, while the United States allowed
    broadband to consolidate. As a result, a lot more competition in Europe has subsequently
    pushed speeds up and prices down. Today, the internet is faster in many places
    than it is in the United States. What this means for future shifts in the tech
    industry is unclear. Any number of factors can change which paradigms are being
    pushed as best practices. Exposure to technology can create a new market, and
    that market could run parallel as mainframes and PCs still do, or it could completely
    overtake another market, just as entertainment-optimized cellphones wiped out
    BlackBerries and other business-focused phones. Prices could drop. Resources could
    become scarce. Rarely if ever are these changes fueled by pure technical superiority.

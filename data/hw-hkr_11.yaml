    tend to pick from a palette of existing processes to develop products. Most consumer
    electronic devices are an amalgamation of rigid PCBs with SMT reflow or through-hole
    wave soldering, ABS or PC injection molding, sheet-metal forming, and some finishing
    processes like painting or electroplating. These options cover the full range
    of utility most products require. Really outstanding products, however, also tend
    to introduce new materials or novel manufacturing processes.

  zh: 在如今的合同制造和交钥匙服务提供商的世界里，设计师通常会从现有工艺中挑选一套方案来开发产品。大多数消费电子设备是由刚性PCB、表面贴装焊接（SMT回流焊）或穿孔波峰焊接、ABS或PC注塑成型、钣金成型以及一些后处理工艺（如喷漆或电镀）等工艺组成的混合体。这些选项涵盖了大多数产品所需的功能。然而，真正出色的产品通常会引入新材料或创新的制造工艺。
- en: Developing those new processes doesn’t have to be expensive—as long as you’re
    willing to go onto the factory floor and direct the improvements yourself. In
    other words, the expensive bit of process development is typically paying the
    experts developing and qualifying the process, not so much the equipment or materials.

- en: To prove that point to myself, I started exploring flex circuits as a design
    medium. Instead of using a 1- or 2-millimeter-thick rigid substrate composed of
    woven glass fiber impregnated with a stiff epoxy, flex circuits typically use
    a pliable polymer substrate just fractions of a millimeter thick. Polyimide is
    a popular substrate in flex circuits because of its ability to withstand soldering
    temperatures. Although flex-circuit technology is common inside consumer products
    (a mobile phone probably contains at least a half-dozen flex PCBs, connecting
    peripherals like buttons, cameras, and displays to the mainboard), this technology
    is underrepresented in hobby and DIY products. But I don’t think it has to be.

  zh: 为了向自己证明这一点，我开始探索将柔性电路作为设计媒介。与使用1毫米或2毫米厚的刚性基板（由编织玻璃纤维和刚性环氧树脂组成）不同，柔性电路通常使用厚度只有几分之一毫米的可弯曲聚合物基板。聚酰亚胺是柔性电路中常见的基板材料，因为它能耐受高温焊接。尽管柔性电路技术在消费类产品中应用广泛（比如一部手机可能至少包含六个以上的柔性PCB，连接按钮、摄像头和显示屏等外设与主板），但这种技术在爱好者和DIY产品中的应用仍然较少。但我认为这并非必须如此。
- en: I had a hunch that the right kind of product designed in flex could enable new
    and creative applications, but I wasn’t quite sure how, so I decided to learn
    more about the unique benefits and challenges of designing for flexible circuits.
    As part of a project where I explored the guts of SD cards, which I’ll talk more
    about in [Chapter 9](ch09.xhtml#ch09), I needed to create an adapter for my Novena
    that would allow me to snoop and emulate the NAND flash memory found inside certain
    styles of older SD cards. The thinness and pliability of flexible circuits were
    a great match for the job.

  zh: 我有预感，设计出合适的柔性电路产品可以启用新的创意应用，但我不完全确定该如何实现，于是我决定进一步了解设计柔性电路的独特优势和挑战。在一个项目中，我深入研究了SD卡的内部结构，更多内容将在[第9章](ch09.xhtml#ch09)中讨论，我需要为我的Novena开发一个适配器，以便让我能够监听并模拟某些旧款SD卡中内置的NAND闪存。柔性电路的薄度和可弯曲性非常适合这个工作。
- en: The resulting adapter was very thin; it fit perfectly under the TSOP package
    of the NAND. The bendy nature of the board meant I could also accommodate a broad
    variety of target board shapes, even boards much larger than a typical SD card.
    Although a useful application of flexible circuits, it still felt like I was just
    scratching the surface of possibility.

    In the magnified section of Z-tape laminated onto a polyimide substrate shown
    here, the silvery-white stipples are tiny metal particles that span from one side
    of the adhesive layer to the other according to a statistical distribution. Given
    the nature of the metal distribution, to ensure good electrical contact, each
    pad on a circuit sticker needed to be fairly large. Furthermore, traces very close
    to each other could be shorted out by the embedded metal particles, so as I designed
    the circuits, I had to be careful to leave enough space between exposed pads.
    The datasheet for the Z-tape material contains rules for the minimum pad size
    and spacing, so I used those as a guide.

  zh: 制作这些电路贴纸的过程主要围绕着Z胶带的限制。在这里展示的Z胶带附着在聚酰亚胺基板上的放大部分中，银白色的小斑点是微小的金属颗粒，它们根据统计分布从胶粘层的一侧延伸到另一侧。鉴于金属颗粒的分布特性，为了确保良好的电气接触，每个电路贴纸上的焊盘必须相当大。此外，彼此非常接近的电路轨迹可能会被嵌入的金属颗粒短路，所以在设计电路时，我必须小心地在裸露的焊盘之间留出足够的空间。Z胶带材料的数据表中包含了最小焊盘尺寸和间距的规定，因此我以此为指导。

    research, we had two options for doing user testing. The traditional academic
    approach would have been to apply for a budget from her advisor, produce a limited
    number of stickers, and conduct a series of closed workshops to study how young
    and creative minds interacted with this new media. But this happened in 2013,
    so viable crowdfunding platforms unlocked the possibility of offering our research
    directly to interested users, thus allowing us to conduct research at scale. The
    MIT Media Lab where Jie researched is also very keyed in to the possibilities
    enabled by research at scale, as embodied by their “deploy” initiative. In 2011,
    when Joi Ito became the Media Lab’s new director, he started transforming the
    Media Lab’s culture from “demo or die” to “deploy or die,” which was eventually
    shortened to the less menacing “deploy” directive. Under the old “demo or die”
    regime, research groups were encouraged to create whizzy demonstrations of technology
    that could help raise money. Under Ito’s directive, the idea is to get technology
    out of the lab and into the wild by conducting research at scale through tools
    like crowdfunding and lean hardware.

  zh: 当我收到带有模板的传感器和微控制器套件样品时，我试用了它们。杰完全正确地指出了它们的实用性。当我有了一个模板来操作时，尤其是在处理那个有七个紧密排列的接触点的微控制器贴纸时，我发现我的工作效率大大提高，我觉得用户们也会认同。正因为如此，尽管模板在最初的活动中并没有承诺作为一部分，但所有订购传感器和微控制器套件的支持者都收到了一个免费的模板，帮助他们布局设计。

- en: Even though the Chinese New Year is a two-week holiday, our initial schedule
    essentially wrote off the month of February. Reality matched this expectation,
    but I want to share with you exactly how Chinese New Year impacted this project,
    in case you’re considering manufacturing a product in China.

  zh: 尽管春节假期是为期两周的假期，我们最初的计划几乎已经排除了二月份的时间。现实也与这一预期相符，但我想分享一下春节是如何影响这个项目的，万一你打算在中国制造产品的话，希望你能从中汲取一些经验。
- en: We had a draft manuscript of our book ready in January, but I couldn’t get a
    complete sample until March. That wasn’t because the printer was closed for a
    month straight; like everyone else, their holiday was about two weeks long. The
    paper vendor, however, started their holiday about 10 days before the printer,
    and the binding vendor ended their holiday about 10 days after the printer. Even
    though each vendor took only two weeks off, the net supply chain for printing
    a custom book was out for around 24 days, or effectively the entire month of February.
    The staggered observance of Chinese New Year is necessary because of the sheer
    magnitude of human migration that accompanies the holiday.

  zh: 我们的书籍草稿本来在一月份就准备好了，但直到三月我才拿到完整的样品。这并不是因为印刷厂停工一个月；像其他所有人一样，他们的假期大约也只有两周。不过，纸张供应商的假期在印刷厂之前大约提前了10天，而装订厂的假期则在印刷厂之后延长了10天。尽管每个供应商的假期都只有两周，但定制书籍的整个供应链实际上停工了大约24天，或者说几乎整个月的二月。春节假期的错峰安排是因为假期期间的庞大人口流动。

- en: When I ran the initial numbers on shipping, I realized that we weren’t exactly
    selling circuit stickers—taking the book into account, by volume and weight, our
    principal product was printed paper. To optimize logistics cost, I pushed to ship
    starter kits (which contained a book) and additional stand-alone book orders by
    ocean, rather than air.

  zh: 当我初步计算发货成本时，我意识到我们并不单纯是在卖电路贴纸——考虑到书籍的体积和重量，我们的主要产品其实是印刷纸张。为了优化物流成本，我推动将启动套件（包含书籍）和额外的单独书籍订单通过海运，而不是空运。
- en: We actually had starter kits and books ready to go almost four weeks before
    the first kits shipped, but we just couldn’t get a reasonable quotation for the
    cost of shipping them by ocean. We spent almost three weeks haggling and quoting
    with ocean freight companies. In the end, their price was basically the same as
    going by air but would take three weeks longer and incurred more risk. Freight
    cost is apparently a minor component of shipping by ocean, and you get killed
    by a multitude of surcharges, from paying the longshoremen to paying all the intermediate
    brokers and warehouses that handle your goods at the dock. Those fixed costs added
    up such that even though we were shipping over 60 cartons of goods, air shipping
    was still more cost-effective.

  zh: 实际上，我们几乎在第一个套件发货前四周就准备好了启动套件和书籍，但我们就是无法得到合理的海运报价。我们花了差不多三周的时间与海运公司讨价还价并报价。最后，他们的价格基本和空运差不多，但需要多花三周时间，并且风险更大。显然，海运的运费只是其中的一小部分，真正让你吃亏的是各种附加费，从支付码头工人费到支付所有中介经纪人和仓库处理费用。那些固定成本累加起来，即便我们发货超过60个箱子，空运仍然更具成本效益。

    before they hatched. Problems ranging from a routine UPS screwup to a tragic aviation
    accident to a logistics problem at Crowd Supply’s fulfillment depot to a customs
    problem could stymie an on-time delivery. But, at the very least, we did everything
    within our power to deliver on time.

- en: Thankfully, when all was said and done, our backers received their orders right
    on time. Since then, Chibitronics has continued to surpass my wildest expectations.
    Although we started this project as an academic experiment, grassroots user adoption
    prompted us to grow the experiment into a full-fledged company. As the circuit
    stickers are an open hardware project, the specs are available for savvy hackers
    to play with, but most users are nontechnical folks who would benefit more directly
    from support on basic usage. To that end, the company strives to provide users
    with assistance, activities, and more stickers to help them keep learning and
    making beautiful electronic crafts.

  zh: 幸运的是，最终我们的支持者准时收到了他们的订单。从那时起，Chibitronics 一直超出了我最疯狂的预期。虽然我们最初将这个项目作为一个学术实验，但草根用户的采用促使我们将实验发展成了一家完整的公司。由于电路贴纸是一个开源硬件项目，规格可以供精明的黑客玩弄，但大多数用户都是非技术人士，他们从基础使用的支持中能获得更多的帮助。因此，公司努力为用户提供帮助、活动和更多的贴纸，帮助他们继续学习和制作美丽的电子工艺品。

    business-person. Once the company is big enough to support its own staff in a
    sustainable fashion, I’m looking forward to handing over the reins, returning
    to my workbench, and dreaming up new open hardware inventions.'

  zh: Chibitronics 对我来说是一次持续的学习经历，因为我从未有过公司像这样成功成熟的经验。我很期待看到公司未来的发展，但作为一名工程师，我也知道自己的局限：我并不适合做生意。当公司足够大，能够以可持续的方式支持自己的员工时，我期待着将公司交给别人，回到我的工作台，继续构思新的开源硬件发明。

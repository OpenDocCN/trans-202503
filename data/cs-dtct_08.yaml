- en: The Port of Mudwall didn’t even live up to its unimpressive name. It wasn’t
    much of a port; the rickety wooden dock could fit no more than two modestly sized
    ships. The mudwall itself, in theory a 20-foot-tall earthen city wall, had never
    actually been constructed, and was only hinted at here and there with 2-foot-tall
    humps surrounding about a third of the city.

    can’t always follow clues in a straight path from start to finish. The world is
    filled with useless information, ambigious clues, and red herrings. On top of
    that, you’ll make mistakes. So it’s important to know how to backtrack a search
    when you hit a dead end. Simply put, this means backing up your search to a previous
    state and trying a different option.

- en: Up until this point, algorithms have been presented on search spaces where they
    can efficiently jump from any state to any other arbitrary state. For example,
    in an array, you can easily examine the value at any location using just its index.
    And in a hotel hallway, you can run between rooms. This flexibility provides efficiency
    for the algorithms.

- en: However, many search spaces come with constraints on how you can move from state
    to state. If you are searching a castle in the physical world, you can’t jump
    arbitrarily between rooms—you have to traverse the halls and rooms in between.
    Similar constraints can apply in the computational realm for data structures like

- en: 'Even in cases where you can jump between states, it is often useful to picture
    backtracking as moving through previous states on your way to explore new states.
    In the algorithmic world, this can be significantly less costly than physically
    retracing your route. However, the processes are conceptually similar: you back
    up the search and proceed down a different avenue.'

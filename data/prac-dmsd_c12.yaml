- en: In some of the more radical flavors of survivalist lore, no sin is as grave
    as letting others know that you prep. The thinking is that the unwashed masses
    are irredeemable and destined to perish in the wake of The Event, so there’s no
    need to trouble yourself with helping them; as for survivalists who spill the
    beans, they’ll undoubtedly have to fend off angry mobs clamoring for a share of
    their supplies. Moved by such visions, many newcomers to the community go to great
    lengths to conceal their hobby—not just from neighbors or relatives, but also
    from delivery people, banks, and other perceived prying eyes.

  zh: 在一些更为激进的生存主义文化中，没有什么罪过比让别人知道你在准备物资更为严重。其背后的思维是，未开化的群众注定是无法拯救的，并且将在灾难发生后灭绝，因此没有必要去麻烦自己帮助他们；至于那些泄露自己准备情况的生存主义者，他们无疑将不得不抵挡愤怒的人群，后者会争抢他们的物资。受到这种预想的影响，许多新加入这个社区的人都会极力掩藏自己的爱好——不仅是对邻居或亲戚，甚至是对送货员、银行以及其他被认为可能窥探的眼睛。
- en: 'I don’t buy this philosophy. Of course, restraint has merit: nothing good can
    come of posting selfies with gold bars or wads of cash, and in a widespread and
    profound downturn, the number of souls a single person can help is limited. But
    in trying times, people almost always come together and find strength in local
    communities. It’s much better to be a part of a resilient group than a lone warrior
    trying to take on the world. Given the localized nature of most disasters, it’s
    also better if your group consists of neighbors, coworkers, and relatives, rather
    than a scattered collection of internet strangers who live hundreds of miles apart.'

  zh: 我不认同这种哲学。当然，节制是有其价值的：发布自己与金条或大把现金的自拍照不会带来什么好处，而在广泛而深刻的经济衰退中，一个人能帮助的人的数量也是有限的。但在困难时期，人们几乎总是会聚集在一起，在地方社区中找到力量。成为一个具有韧性的群体的一部分，比孤军奋战、试图单独面对整个世界要好得多。鉴于大多数灾难的局部性，如果你的群体由邻居、同事和亲戚组成，而不是由分散在数百英里之外的互联网陌生人组成，那也会更好。
- en: Further, most disasters aren’t the end of the world. A week-long power outage
    is a fantastic opportunity to make friends and support neighbors in small ways;
    it would be a shame to barricade the door the moment the lights go out, anticipating
    that they might never come back on. It’s also good to remember that most disasters
    don’t unfold precisely as planned. If you break a leg in the midst of the commotion,
    or if your supplies are damaged or spoiled, having self-sufficient kindred spirits
    you can turn to can make all the difference in the world.

  zh: 此外，大多数灾难并不是世界的终结。一场持续一周的停电是一个与邻里建立友谊并在小事情上互相支持的绝佳机会；一旦停电，你如果立刻把门锁住，预期电力可能永远不会恢复，那就太可惜了。还要记住，大多数灾难的展开并不完全如预期。如果你在混乱中摔断了腿，或者你的物资损坏或变质，能够依赖那些自给自足的志同道合的人，可能会带来天壤之别。
- en: 'I suspect the reason some members of the prepping community are so insular
    is that they don’t feel taken seriously by the outside world. The obligatory and
    harmless joke uttered by many outsiders—“Oh, you’re a prepper. I know where to
    go if I need anything!”—is taken as a genuine threat. Some of the difficulties
    the prepared encounter have to do with the lingering toxic influence of TV series
    such as *Doomsday Preppers*, but some of the pain is clearly self-inflicted: when
    survivalists unload fringe critiques of fractional reserve banking or their theories
    of nuclear warfare onto an uninitiated audience, it’s hard to blame the other
    party if all they can come back with is a blank stare or an off-the-cuff joke.'

  zh: 我怀疑一些生存主义社区成员如此封闭的原因，是因为他们感觉外界没有认真对待他们。外界许多人习惯性且无害的玩笑——“哦，你是个生存主义者。如果我需要什么，就知道去哪找了！”——会被视为一种真正的威胁。一些生存主义者遇到的困难，与电视节目《末日生存者》（*Doomsday
    Preppers*）的有害影响有关，但其中一些痛苦显然是自我造成的：当生存主义者将他们对部分储备银行制或核战争理论的边缘批评强加给一个外行观众时，如果对方回来的只有空洞的凝视或即兴的笑话，也很难怪他们。
- en: My favorite approach to getting folks interested in emergency preparedness isn’t
    to school them on how they should be living their lives or to bury them in data,
    but to casually bring up a perilous experience lived by a common friend, or to
    mention a regional disaster that happened some weeks back. Then, rather than giving
    my conversation partner unsolicited advice, I ask them how they feel about it,
    and if there’s anything we could conceivably do to protect our families. If they
    laugh it off, I might try once more some time later, perhaps bringing up one of
    the simple steps I decided to take, but then leave it at that. The goal isn’t
    to convert; it’s to plant the seed of rational doubt about their current approach
    to managing risk. It can be months before the seed takes hold, and if it never
    does, that’s fine. Not prepping is a rational choice too.

  zh: 我让人们对紧急准备感兴趣的方式，并不是教育他们应该如何生活，或是用大量数据把他们淹没，而是随意提起一位普通朋友曾经经历过的危险事件，或者提到几周前发生的区域性灾难。然后，除了给我的对话伙伴不请自来的建议，我会问他们对这件事有什么看法，是否有我们可以做的事情来保护我们的家人。如果他们一笑而过，我可能会在稍后的某个时刻再尝试一次，或许提到我决定采取的某个简单步骤，但就此作罢。我的目标不是改变他们的想法，而是在人们当前的风险管理方式中播下理性怀疑的种子。这个种子可能需要几个月才能扎根，如果它最终没有生根，那也没关系。不做准备也是一种理性的选择。
- en: Beyond building a network of like-minded individuals interested in disaster
    preparedness, cultivating neighborly relationships throughout your community in
    a more basic way is also worthwhile. In a crisis that overwhelms hospitals, for
    instance, being on good terms with a veterinarian or a physician can help avoid
    misery or even save a life. For introverts and extroverts alike, it pays to say
    hi to neighbors, engage in small talk, and offer to help with minor hurdles every
    now and then; finding common interests is a powerful bonding method too. I figure
    that even if the zombie apocalypse never comes, such gestures can’t be a waste
    of time.

  zh: 除了建立一个志同道合的灾难准备网络，在社区中培养邻里关系的基本方式也是值得的。例如，在医院超负荷的危机中，与兽医或医生保持良好关系可以避免痛苦，甚至挽救生命。对于内向者和外向者来说，主动向邻居打个招呼、进行闲聊，偶尔提供帮助解决一些小困难，都是值得的；找到共同的兴趣也是一种强大的纽带方式。我认为，即使僵尸末日永远不会到来，这样的举动也绝不会浪费时间。

- en: In the early days, several people were working on different aspects of partnerships
    and business deals. Andy Rubin had ideas about whom to work with and how to make
    this strategy succeed. After all, he co-founded and ran a successful mobile device
    company (Danger). But there was also Android co-founder Nick Sears, recently from
    T-Mobile, who was instrumental in signing T-Mobile as the Android launch partner
    for the G1\. Hiroshi Lockheimer was crucial in partnership relationships as well,
    in project-managing the development of Android on partner devices. Rich Miner,
    another Android co-founder, had come from Orange Telecom, where he had worked
    with carriers and had run a venture fund that invested in mobile and platform
    companies (including Danger). In addition to managing the engineering teams working
    on the Android browser and speech recognition, Rich was part of the business team
    that helped make the deal for the Motorola Droid, along with Hiroshi and Tom Moss.

  zh: 在早期，有几个人在处理不同方面的合作伙伴关系和商业交易。Andy Rubin对与谁合作以及如何使这项战略成功有很多想法。毕竟，他共同创办并运营过一家成功的移动设备公司（Danger）。但还有Android的联合创始人Nick
    Sears，曾任职T-Mobile，他在将T-Mobile签约为G1的Android首发合作伙伴方面发挥了重要作用。Hiroshi Lockheimer在合作伙伴关系方面也至关重要，他负责管理Android在合作伙伴设备上的开发。另一个Android的联合创始人Rich
    Miner曾在Orange Telecom工作，与运营商合作，并管理过一个投资于移动和平台公司的风险投资基金（包括Danger）。除了管理负责Android浏览器和语音识别的工程团队外，Rich还是商业团队的一员，帮助达成了摩托罗拉Droid的交易，与Hiroshi和Tom
    Moss一起。

- en: Tom started in May of 2007 in Google’s legal department. One of his specialties,
    prior to Google, had been open source technology. As soon as he started, he was
    told that he’d be working on an open source project called Android, which was
    launching an SDK that Fall.

  zh: Tom于2007年5月加入谷歌的法律部门。在加入谷歌之前，他的专长之一是开源技术。一开始，他就被告知将参与一个名为Android的开源项目，该项目将在那个秋季发布SDK。
- en: “One of my first deals was Qualcomm, doing the license for the 7200 AMSS chipset
    code, to create Linux drivers that we could release. It was super complicated
    at the time because Qualcomm was scared to death of open source.”

  zh: “我做的第一笔交易之一是与高通合作，获取7200 AMSS芯片组代码的许可，开发Linux驱动程序，以便发布。这当时非常复杂，因为高通对开源极为恐惧。”
- en: 'Tom originally helped out from the legal side but ended up doing deals directly.
    “I started supporting Andy on deals, and Rich Miner and some of the others as
    a lawyer. More and more, Andy would just leave me alone: ‘Here’s the deal we need.
    Go do the deal.’ Andy was busy, so he wouldn’t want to sit through all of the
    negotiations and everything.”'

- en: 'He also worked on a strategy of how to connect all the different stakeholders:
    app developers, handset manufacturers, carriers, and platform software teams.
    One of the tricks with open source software is motivation; why would any of these
    partners care about the Android platform except Google? “How do you get everybody
    incentivized and invested into this ecosystem in a way that would maintain compatibility?”'

  zh: 他还负责制定如何连接所有不同利益相关者的战略：应用开发者、手机制造商、运营商和平台软件团队。开源软件的一大难题是激励机制；除了谷歌，为什么这些合作伙伴会关心Android平台？“如何以一种能保持兼容性的方式，激励每个人投入到这个生态系统中？”
- en: Of course, app developers would care deeply about compatibility. Being able
    to run the same application across different implementations of Android would
    be a far cry better than what developers faced on platforms like Symbian and Java
    ME, where apps would frequently need to be rewritten to work across different
    devices. But the dynamics for manufacturers were different, and they were used
    to a world where they were responsible only for their own devices and implementations.

  zh: 当然，应用开发者会非常关注兼容性。在不同版本的 Android 上运行相同的应用程序，比起开发者在 Symbian 和 Java ME 等平台上遇到的情况要好得多，在那些平台上，应用程序通常需要重写才能适配不同的设备。但对于制造商来说，情况不同，他们习惯于只对自己的设备和实现负责的世界。
- en: Fortunately, Google had popular apps that manufacturers wanted on their devices,
    including Maps, YouTube, and the web browser. So Tom hammered out a system where
    access to those apps was an incentive for partners to maintain compatibility by
    shipping Android as-is, rather than shipping a forked version of it.^([2](#c28-footnote-2))

  zh: 幸运的是，谷歌拥有一些制造商希望在其设备上使用的热门应用程序，包括 Maps、YouTube 和网页浏览器。因此，Tom 制定了一个系统，通过提供这些应用程序的访问权限，作为合作伙伴保持兼容性的激励，要求他们按原样发布
    Android，而不是发布修改版的 Android^([2](#c28-footnote-2))。

- en: Since Tom’s job had become more about making deals than legal work, he moved
    into a group called New Business Development (NBD) that specialized in helping
    various Google teams on the business side. He continued working solely for Android,
    but still didn’t report into Android directly.

  zh: 由于 Tom 的工作更多是关于达成交易而非法律事务，他加入了一个叫做新业务发展（NBD）的团队，这个团队专门帮助谷歌的各个团队处理业务方面的事务。他继续专注于
    Android，但仍然没有直接向 Android 团队汇报。
- en: In the meantime, Andy needed a team in Japan to help with development issues
    there (including internationalization and keyboard support). Tom volunteered to
    help. The move made sense for him since many of the deals he worked on were in
    Asia anyway. He transferred to the Google Tokyo office and hired a team of engineers,
    missing the G1 launch that happened in California just two weeks after he moved.

  zh: 与此同时，Andy 需要在日本组建一个团队来帮助解决那里的开发问题（包括国际化和键盘支持）。Tom 自愿提供帮助。这个决定对他来说是合情合理的，因为他参与的很多交易都在亚洲地区。他转到谷歌东京办公室，并组建了一支工程师团队，错过了他搬到东京后仅两周在加利福尼亚举行的
    G1 发布会。
- en: Meanwhile, Andy wanted to have more direct visibility into Tom’s work for Android,
    so Tom transferred to the Android team. This meant, for silly reasons related
    to Android being part of a large company, that Tom had to be reclassified as an
    engineer. “I was, I believe, the first business person at Google to move to the
    engineering ladder.^([3](#c28-footnote-3)) So I was an engineer on paper. To be
    clear, I never wrote any code.”

  zh: 与此同时，Andy 希望能更直接地了解 Tom 在 Android 工作的情况，于是 Tom 转到了 Android 团队。这意味着由于与 Android
    是大公司一部分的“愚蠢”原因，Tom 必须被重新归类为工程师。“我相信我是谷歌第一个从业务部门转到工程岗位的人^([3](#c28-footnote-3))。所以从名义上讲，我是工程师。需要明确的是，我从未写过代码。”

    buying a phone from an OEM, a handset manufacturer. But we were integral to a
    lot of these deals in terms of putting our brand or marketing either on the box,
    or the phone, or just on marketing campaigns. We set up these deals to create

    Android 创造了势头。我们会与运营商谈判，也会与手机制造商谈判。”

    Docomo, negotiate with HTC. And then we worked on the marketing campaign with

    the user manual in both Japanese and English and made comments and fixed the really
    silly mistakes they had, like ‘The battery was consumable,’ like you could eat
    the battery. We did everything. We did every part of everything that was necessary

- en: 'Jeff Hamilton noted that this approach to global partnerships was how Android
    got to the scale that it has. “There are like two billion^([4](#c28-footnote-4))
    devices out there. One company can’t build that many devices and support them
    all. Especially the variety of things: different devices that people want, different
    price points, configurations, all that kind of stuff. It’s a huge variety. By
    doing the open source thing and having one stack that supported that and having
    partners set up the factories that build out the things required—for networks
    in Turkey or whatever, the different requirements—one company can’t take all of
    that on. There are different requirements in different regions. We scaled that
    by having different companies pick that up and take that on.”'

  zh: Jeff Hamilton指出，这种全球合作伙伴关系的方式是Android能够达到目前规模的原因。“外面有大约二十亿^([4](#c28-footnote-4))部设备。一个公司无法制造那么多设备并支持它们。尤其是设备的种类：人们想要的不同设备、不同的价格点、配置，所有这些都涉及。这是一个巨大的种类。通过做开源的事情，拥有一个支持这些的技术栈，并让合作伙伴建立生产这些所需设备的工厂——比如土耳其的网络要求，或者其他的不同需求——一个公司是无法承担所有这些的。不同地区有不同的要求。我们通过让不同的公司承担这些工作来实现了扩展。”

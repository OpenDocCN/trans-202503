    kindly allowed me to publish an English translation on my blog. In the first section,
    I discussed my thoughts on the maker movement, which was relatively new at the

    twice as much memory every 1.5 to 2 years. Only software mattered, because unless
    you could afford to fab a chip in the latest technology, making hardware wasn’t
    worth it. By the time you got the components together, a new chip would make your
    design look slow. Optimizing software also mattered less than features, convenience,
    and creativity. Users could just buy a faster computer and run old software faster.
    “Making” fell out of fashion because there was no time for it: you had to ship

    5与iPhone 4非常相似，三星手机的各个版本在外观上也差别不大。
- en: The question, then, is how to innovate? How can you create market differentiation?
    With Moore’s law slowing down, it’s possible to innovate in hardware and not have
    your innovation look slow because a new chip came out. You have steady platforms
    (PCs, smartphones, tablets) that you can target your hardware ideas toward. You
    don’t have to fab chips just to have an advantage. Everyone is now sifting through
    technology’s past, looking for niches that were overlooked. Even an outdated smartphone

- en: Furthermore, as humans, we fundamentally feel differently toward physical things
    and virtual things. Apps are wonderful, but human homes are more than a smartphone,
    a food tray, a bed, and a toilet. People still surround themselves with knickknacks,

    people who aren’t programmers or hardware designers want to access hardware technology,
    too. Some very moving, deep interactive art pieces have been made using the Arduino,
    allowing hardware to transform menial control applications into artwork that changes
    your mood or makes you think about life differently. I think Arduino is just the

    think other platforms will follow in its footsteps. It’s cheap enough that for
    many applications, you can use the Raspberry Pi as is and gain no net cost advantage

    thing about this platform is that instead of buying a reference design and then

    There’s still a market for million-unit blockbuster devices like smartphones and
    coffeemakers, but eventually, there will also be a market for devices that only
    have a production run of 1,000 to 10,000 units, but with a much higher margin.
    These small-run products will be developed and sold by teams of just one or two
    people so that the profit will still be a good living for the individuals. The
    key to the success for these products is that they are highly customized and help
    solve a specific problem for a small group of users who are willing to pay more
    for the solution.

- en: Open hardware is more of a philosophy. The success or failure of a product is
    largely disconnected from whether the hardware is open or closed. Closing hardware
    doesn’t stop people from cloning or copying, and opening hardware doesn’t mean
    that bad ideas will be copied simply because they are open. Unlike software, hardware
    requires a supply chain, distribution, and a network of relationships to build
    it at a low cost. That overhead means being open or closed is only a small part
    of the equation, and the question of whether to open or close a project revolves
    around how much you want to involve end users or third parties to modify or interoperate

    workers used to build them; the quality control procedures; and the manufacturing
    process are all important factors in the final product’s cost, look, feel, and
    performance. Simply giving someone a copy of my schematics and drawings doesn’t
    mean they can make my exact product. Even injection molding has art to it. If
    I give the same CAD drawing to two tooling makers, the outcome could be very different
    depending on where the mold maker decides to place the gates, the ejector pins,
    the cooling for the mold, the mold cycle time, temperature, and so on.'

    license, hardware is essentially open, at least at the level of schematics and
    PCB layout. For a relatively small amount of money, you can pay a service to extract
    the details required to copy a PCB design. Therefore, you can assume that once
    you ship hardware, it can be copied. If you accept this assumption, then it follows
    that not releasing schematics and PCB layouts won’t stop people from copying your
    goods. If someone wants to copy a piece of hardware, they will, whether you share
    your design files or not.

  zh: 我关于开源硬件的一个核心理论是，不论许可证如何，硬件本质上是开放的，至少在原理图和PCB布局层面上是开放的。花费相对少量的钱，你可以支付服务费来提取复制PCB设计所需的细节。因此，你可以假设，一旦你发货，硬件就能被复制。如果你接受这个假设，那么就会得出结论，不发布原理图和PCB布局并不会阻止人们复制你的产品。如果有人想复制某个硬件，无论你是否分享设计文件，他们都会去复制。
- en: But sharing design files does make a difference to a separate and important
    group of people. There are other businesses and individual innovators who could
    use your design files to design accessories, upgrades, or third-party enhancements
    that rely upon your product. In that case, sharing your design files improves
    your opportunity for new business relationships, which makes doing so (with an
    open source hardware license to reserve a few basic rights and protections) a
    practical suggestion.

    I think it’s very culturally difficult in an Asian context to discuss code quality
    and architectural decisions. The field of software itself is only 30 years old,
    and older, more experienced engineers are also the most out of date in terms of
    methodology and knowledge. In fact, the young engineers often have the best ideas.

    must see a real financial reward for accepting their mistakes, instead of saving
    face by forcing junior engineers to code patches around bad high-level decisions.
    US companies usually achieve this alignment by sharing equity in a company among
    the engineers so that the big payout only comes if the company as a whole survives,

  zh: 现在，我正在与Jie Qi合作开发电路贴纸。我们已经接近开始发货的阶段，我下定决心要确保我能按计划按时交付。我真的希望按时发货，并按我承诺的时间将产品送到客户手中，因为众筹项目中迟交的情况太多了。其实不一定非得那样。你只需要设定好预期，在公布日期之前把所有事情准备好，并且知道库存差不多就绪了。我们有几条正在销售的产品线，其中大约一半已经完成制造，只是在工厂等待发货。有几条新产品线进度滞后，但我们还有时间解决这些问题，直到5月。我认为这没有问题，我期待着看到我们的产品线成长、发展，并与更多的人合作。
- en: The other thing I am working on is this Novena laptop project with Sean Cross,
    which we weren’t really planning on doing last year. I built this handmade prototype
    last December; it was a little, kind of crummy, leather-and-paper thing. We used
    it to give a presentation at CCC, and the response was overwhelming. That was
    great, and I refactored the design to make it more manufacturable and more sourceable.
    The campaign seems to be going well so far. I think it will fund, and I’m looking
    forward to getting Novena manufactured and out in the world.

  zh: 我目前正在与肖恩·克罗斯合作开发这个Novena笔记本项目，去年我们并没有真正计划去做这个项目。我在去年12月制作了这个手工原型；它是一个有点粗糙的皮革和纸做的东西。我们用它在CCC上做了一个展示，反响非常强烈。那真是太棒了，于是我重新设计了它，使其更加适合生产和采购。到目前为止，众筹活动似乎进展顺利。我觉得它会成功融资，我也很期待Novena的生产并推出市场。

  zh: '***你从两次众筹活动中学到了什么？***'
- en: Completing almost two crowdfunding campaigns has given me a lot of insight.
    Earlier, I mentioned that people selling online price their product too low to
    later move into retail. But it’s been really painful to maintain the high price
    that I say that everyone else should maintain. It’s so tempting to go lower to
    an unsustainable point.

  zh: 完成几乎两次众筹活动让我收获了很多洞察。之前我提到过，在线销售的人通常把产品定价过低，导致之后无法进入零售市场。但维持我所说的每个人都应该保持的高价格真的很痛苦。降低价格到一个不可持续的点是非常诱人的。
- en: The reason a lot of crowdfunding campaigns fail to deliver is because they price
    too low. They can’t actually build the product for the price they set. Even knowing
    this, I still had to grit my teeth on the laptop because I had to price it higher
    than I would have liked. Despite the high price, if we were to close the campaign
    at exactly the amount I hope to raise, I would probably just barely not lose money
    on it, but a lot of people don’t see that. Look at something like the Ubuntu Edge,
    which raised $12 million but needed $25 million to succeed. That’s because in
    order to set a price of $700–800 per phone, they had to build 40,000 phones. So
    even though people thought the Ubuntu Edge was cool and it raised a lot of money,
    it didn’t reach its funding goal, which is a sad conclusion for everyone.

  zh: 很多众筹活动未能交付的原因是因为他们定价过低。他们根本无法以设定的价格来生产产品。即使知道这一点，我还是得咬紧牙关定价较高，因为我必须将笔记本定价高于我原本希望的价格。尽管价格较高，如果我们能以我希望筹集的金额关闭众筹活动，我可能刚好不会亏损，但很多人看不到这一点。像Ubuntu
    Edge这样的项目就很典型，它筹集了1200万美元，但需要2500万美元才能成功。那是因为为了将每台手机的价格定在700-800美元之间，他们必须生产40,000部手机。所以尽管人们认为Ubuntu
    Edge很酷，而且筹集了大量资金，但它没有达到筹款目标，这是对所有人来说都很悲哀的结局。
- en: I knew I could either price my laptop much lower and need thousands of people
    to buy it to reach my goal, or I could service a really focused market of a few
    hundred open source enthusiasts who are totally on the same page as me. At the
    end of the day, especially in the early phases, you really want those enthusiasts.
    They’re going to be your best users. You want to take care of them and give them
    the best service possible. You’re going to charge a little more, but you’re going
    to build a really good product for them and they’re going to be happy. That’s
    a much happier conclusion in my mind than trying to shoot the moon and failing.

  zh: 我知道我可以将我的笔记本定价低很多，并需要成千上万的人购买才能达到我的目标，或者我可以为几百个完全认同我理念的开源爱好者提供服务。在一天结束时，尤其是在早期阶段，你真的需要那些热心的支持者。他们会是你最好的用户。你需要照顾好他们，提供最好的服务。你可能会收取稍高的费用，但你会为他们打造一款真正优秀的产品，他们会感到满意。对我来说，这比一开始就瞄准天文数字但最终失败要开心得多。

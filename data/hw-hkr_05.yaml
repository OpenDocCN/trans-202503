  zh: 不同思维：知识产权在中国
- en: China has a reputation for lax enforcement of intellectual property (IP) laws,
    and that leads to problems like fake and copycat products. This part of the book
    takes a nuanced look at China’s IP ecosystem and finds a novel way to reward innovation
    that serves as an alternative to traditional Western IP practices.

  zh: 中国因知识产权（IP）法律执行不严而声名狼藉，这也导致了假货和模仿产品等问题。本书这一部分细致分析了中国的知识产权生态系统，并提出了一种奖励创新的全新方式，这种方式是传统西方知识产权实践的替代方案。
- en: 'First, consider this question: what, exactly, constitutes a fake? It seems
    relatively straightforward to answer; anything that’s not an original must be
    a fake. The situation becomes muddied, however, when you consider the possibility
    that some contract manufacturers produce fakes by running a *ghost shift*, an
    after-hours production run not reported to the product’s brand owner. These items
    are produced on the same equipment, by the same people, and with the same procedures
    as the original product, but they’re sold directly to customers at a much higher
    margin to the manufacturer.'

  zh: 首先，考虑这个问题：究竟什么构成了假货？这个问题似乎相对简单；任何不是原版的东西都应该是假货。然而，当你考虑到一些合同制造商通过进行*鬼班*（即未向品牌所有者报告的下班后生产线）来制造假货时，情况就变得复杂了。这些物品在与原始产品相同的设备、相同的人手和相同的工序下生产，但它们直接以更高的利润率卖给客户。
- en: In fact, the spectrum of fakes runs an entire gamut of possibilities. Used and
    damaged goods get upcycled; production rejects with minor flaws are refurbished
    and sold as originals; original products get relabeled to advertise a higher capability
    or capacity (for example, memory cards with 4GB actual capacity are sold as 8GB),
    and so on. [Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04) relates several encounters I’ve had with
    fake goods in China, and dives into the issues and incentives enabling the rise
    of such fakes.

  zh: 事实上，假货的范围非常广泛。使用过的和损坏的商品经过再利用；有小瑕疵的生产废品经过翻新后作为原版商品出售；原始产品被重新贴标以宣传更高的能力或容量（例如，实际容量为4GB的内存卡被当作8GB出售），等等。[第4章](ch04.xhtml#ch04)讲述了我在中国遇到的几起假货事件，并深入探讨了促进这些假货兴起的各种问题和动机。
- en: Cloning and copying are also common practices in China. A nebulous and sometimes
    shadowy group of rogue innovators known as *shanzhai* creates products that attempt
    to mimic the features and function of an original product, often with assistance
    from the original’s blueprints. But the clones are heavily modified to save cost
    or include unique features. Often, the most offensive aspect of the practice is
    the use of the original product’s brands and trade dress on the clones. Aside
    from trademark violations, a look inside the products reveals an incredible amount
    of original engineering and innovation.

  zh: 克隆和复制也是中国常见的做法。一群模糊不清且有时颇具阴影的“山寨”创新者，创造出试图模仿原始产品特点和功能的产品，通常会借助原始产品的蓝图。但这些克隆产品会经过大量修改，以降低成本或加入独特的功能。通常，这种做法最令人反感的一点是，克隆产品使用了原始产品的品牌和外观设计。除了商标侵权之外，仔细观察这些产品，你会发现其中有大量的原创工程设计和创新。
- en: 'Dismissing the shanzhai as mere thieves and copycats overlooks the fact that
    they can achieve what few Western companies can: they can build complete mobile
    phones, and on a shoestring budget to boot. [Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml#ch05) takes
    a deep dive into a prime example of shanzhai engineering, a feature phone designed
    for emerging markets that costs under $10\. The phone is a tour de force of cost
    reduction and a fresh look at ways of building to address markets that are untouchable
    with Western engineering practices.'

  zh: 将山寨贬低为简单的盗贼和模仿者忽视了一个事实，那就是他们能够做到许多西方公司做不到的事情：他们能够制造出完整的手机，而且预算极其有限。[第5章](ch05.xhtml#ch05)深入剖析了一个典型的山寨工程案例，这是一个针对新兴市场设计的功能手机，售价不到10美元。该手机是成本削减的典范，并为那些西方工程技术无法触及的市场提供了全新的制造方式。
- en: One of the most insightful lean engineering practices enabling the creation
    of complex systems on a shoestring budget is the shanzhai method for sharing IP.
    I’ll explore this by comparing and contrasting the Western notion of open source
    with the shanzhai method, which I refer to as *gongkai*. In Western law, open
    source has a formal definition, referring specifically to an IP sharing system
    governed by an explicit license to share. This license is granted by the copyright
    holder, often with significant commercial restrictions. Open source advocates
    vigorously defend this notion and are quick to dis-avow any IP that doesn’t explicitly
    use an approved license.

  zh: 其中一种启发性强的精益工程实践是山寨方法，它使得在紧张预算下创造复杂系统成为可能。我将通过对比和对照西方的开放源代码理念与山寨方法（我称之为*gongkai*）来探讨这个问题。在西方法律中，开放源代码有一个正式的定义，专指由明确的共享许可协议管理的知识产权共享系统。这个许可由版权持有人授予，通常会附带显著的商业限制。开放源代码的支持者
    vigorously 捍卫这一理念，并迅速否定任何没有明确使用批准许可的知识产权。
- en: In gongkai, if you can obtain a copy of the blueprints, you can use them as
    you please; it doesn’t matter who made them. Yet people still share their ideas
    because the blueprints act as an advertisement. Blueprints often refer explicitly
    to certain chips or contain contact information for the firm that drew them. The
    creators hope circulating their blueprints will bring business to their factory
    when people order parts or sub-assemblies referenced within, or when people call
    their firm to improve or customize the design. In other cases, blueprints are
    traded. For example, there are bulletin board exchanges where before you download
    a blueprint, you must contribute one of your own.

  zh: 在 gongkai 中，如果你能获得蓝图副本，你可以随意使用它们；谁制作的并不重要。然而，人们仍然分享他们的想法，因为蓝图起到了广告的作用。蓝图通常会明确提到某些芯片，或者包含画图公司联系信息。创作者希望通过传播他们的蓝图，能够在别人订购其中提到的零件或子组件时，或者在别人联系他们的公司以改进或定制设计时，将生意带到他们的工厂。在其他情况下，蓝图也会被交易。例如，有些公告板交换平台，在你下载蓝图之前，必须先贡献一份自己的蓝图。
- en: In short, the gongkai IP ecosystem is a variant of the ad-driven business model,
    but optimized for hardware-oriented businesses. Just as Google provides high-quality
    search, email, and mapping services for free in exchange for showing ads, shanzhai
    innovators share ideas to land follow-up orders in their factories.

  zh: 简而言之，gongkai IP 生态系统是广告驱动商业模型的变种，但它被优化用于硬件导向的企业。就像谷歌提供免费的高质量搜索、电子邮件和地图服务以换取展示广告一样，山寨创新者通过分享想法在他们的工厂中争取后续订单。
- en: 'Here lies a key distinction between most Western innovators and their counterparts
    in Shenzhen: everyone who is anyone in Shenzhen owns or has close ties to a factory.
    The fastest path to material wealth is selling more product. Arguing over who
    has rights to abstract ideas is a waste of effort best left for *baijiu*-fueled
    discussions after dinner.[*](footnote.xhtml#fn5) On the opposite end of the spectrum
    are Western patent trolls so removed from factories that they probably don’t even
    have a soldering iron, yet they invest millions of dollars into litigation and
    collecting royalties on ideas they didn’t invent.'

  zh: 这里有一个关键的区别，存在于大多数西方创新者和他们在深圳的同行之间：深圳的每个重要人物都拥有或与一家工厂有密切联系。获得物质财富的最快途径是销售更多的产品。争论谁拥有抽象想法的权利是浪费精力，最适合在晚餐后由*白酒*驱动的讨论中进行。[*](footnote.xhtml#fn5)
    与此相对的是，西方的专利流氓，他们与工厂的联系极为疏远，可能连一个烙铁都没有，却投入数百万美元进行诉讼并收取他们并未发明的想法的专利费。
- en: Neither system is perfect, but the gongkai method is uniquely adapted to the
    fast pace of technology. In a world where chips get faster and cheaper every couple
    of years, a 20-year patent lifetime is an eternity. Spending a decade to bring
    a product to market simply is not an option; the best factories in China can turn
    a napkin sketch into a prototype in days and bring it to scale production in weeks.
    Long patent terms may be appropriate for markets like pharmaceuticals, but in
    fast-moving markets, investing months and tens of thousands of dollars in lawyer
    fees to negotiate a license or just apply for a patent can lead to missed opportunities.

  zh: 两种系统都不是完美的，但 gongkai 方法独特地适应了技术的快速发展。在一个芯片每隔几年就变得更快更便宜的世界里，20年的专利寿命几乎是永恒的。花十年时间将一个产品推向市场根本不可行；中国最好的工厂可以在几天内将餐巾纸上的草图变成原型，并在几周内实现规模化生产。长时间的专利期可能适用于制药等市场，但在快速变化的市场中，花费数月时间和数万美元的律师费用来谈判许可或申请专利可能会错失机会。
- en: Perhaps a discussion on reforming the Western patent system is long overdue.
    The gongkai ecosystem is living proof that granting 20-year monopolies on ideas
    as trivial as “slide to unlock” for a smartphone may not be the One True Path
    to incentivize innovation. I look forward to starting the conversation with this
    whirlwind tour of the good, the bad, and the ugly of the Chinese IP.

  zh: 或许关于改革西方专利制度的讨论早已迫在眉睫。公开生态系统就是活生生的证明，授予像“滑动解锁”这样微不足道的智能手机创意20年的专利垄断，可能并不是激励创新的唯一正确途径。我期待通过这次对中国知识产权的风风火火的巡礼，来开启这场对话，讨论其优点、缺点和丑陋之处。

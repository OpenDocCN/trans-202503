- en: Many people have contributed to the success of this book, both directly, through
    advice and guidance, and indirectly, by publishing GraphQL tools, educational
    resources, blog posts, and cutting-edge research. We would like to thank those
    with whom we’ve worked closely. Without their patience, support, sacrifices, and
    guidance, releasing this book would have been an impossible mission.

  zh: 很多人为这本书的成功做出了贡献，有些人通过直接的建议和指导，有些人通过发布GraphQL工具、教育资源、博客文章和前沿研究间接贡献。我们要感谢那些与我们紧密合作的人。没有他们的耐心、支持、牺牲和指导，出版这本书将是一项不可能完成的任务。
- en: Thank you to Limor-Petersil Farhi, Dolev’s wife and partner, who supported him
    throughout this journey. Without her unconditional support and encouragement,
    this whole process would have been much harder to complete. Writing a book has
    been on Dolev’s to-do list for a long time, and he feels beyond lucky to have
    such a partner in his life who enabled him to do so. Thank you for stepping up
    and taking care of everything else while he was hacking both GraphQL and Microsoft
    Word to get this book out the door.

- en: This may seem like an oddly militaristic introduction to self-defense, but what’s
    true for large armies also holds true for individuals. Very few people who threaten
    to harm others actually have violence as their goal; it’s a means to an end, and
    given the inherent risks of combat, it’s one they’d often rather *not* exercise.
    If a mugger or a home invader brings a weapon with them, it’s almost always just
    to make the victims turn over their belongings without too much of a fuss. It
    follows that to turn the tables on an assailant, the victim usually doesn’t need
    to resort to lethal force. Displaying a reciprocal ability to cause serious harm
    can be enough. This demonstration can be purely visual too; for example, seeing
    the muzzle of a gun or the blade of a kitchen knife is sufficient to make most
    burglars reconsider their plans.

- en: At the same time, in most jurisdictions, several fairly specific conditions
    must be met in order for such a legal excuse to succeed. The first nearly universal
    requirement is *innocence.* The situation that led to the use of force must not
    be a consequence of your own unlawful or reckless behavior—say, deliberately starting
    a fight. Of course, this rule is applied with considerable nuance. For example,
    in some places, if you try to disengage and walk away from a brawl of your doing,
    those pursuing you may now be in the wrong, and you might be able to lawfully
    fend them off. Still, it’s best not to put yourself in situations where your freedom
    would hinge on finer legal points of this sort.

  zh: 与此同时，在大多数司法管辖区，必须满足几个非常具体的条件，才能使这种法律借口成立。几乎普遍的第一个要求是*无辜性*。导致使用武力的情况不得是你自己非法或鲁莽行为的结果——例如故意挑起打斗。当然，这条规则的应用具有相当大的细微差别。例如，在一些地方，如果你试图脱身并从你自己引发的争斗中走开，那么追赶你的人可能就错了，你也许能够合法地自卫。然而，最好不要将自己置于那种依赖这种细致法律细节的情境中。
- en: The second component of lawful self-defense is a rational fear of *imminent
    harm*. You must reasonably believe that there’s an immediate and serious risk
    of injury or death. In many jurisdictions, especially in the United States, you
    don’t need to be objectively right. If you mistook a toy pistol for a real gun,
    for example, you might still be cleared in court. On the other hand, you can’t
    beat up another person just because they voiced a vague threat (“I’ll kill you!”)
    but didn’t start making good on that plan.

  zh: 合法自卫的第二个组成部分是对*迫在眉睫的伤害*的合理恐惧。你必须合理地相信，存在着立即且严重的伤害或死亡风险。在许多司法管辖区，特别是在美国，你不需要在客观上是对的。例如，如果你误把一个玩具手枪当作真枪，你仍然可能在法庭上被判无罪。另一方面，你不能仅仅因为别人说了一个模糊的威胁（“我要杀了你！”）而殴打对方，除非对方已经开始付诸行动。
- en: The third prong present in most legal systems is *proportionality.* Your actions
    must be commensurate with the severity of the threat and must cease once the immediate
    danger ends. A grown man can’t viciously beat a small child; a fleeing robber
    typically can’t be shot in the back. Beyond such egregious examples, in the United
    States, this rule is usually applied in a fairly relaxed fashion, recognizing
    that not every decision is perfectly measured in the heat of the moment. As a
    morbid example, few people get in trouble for emptying half a magazine into an
    armed felon, even if a single shot might have theoretically stopped the threat.
    In countries with a dimmer view of self-defense, such as the United Kingdom, proportionality
    is often dissected with much greater zeal.

  zh: 大多数法律体系中的第三个要素是*比例原则*。你的行为必须与威胁的严重程度相称，并且一旦即时危险消失，行为就应当停止。一个成年人不能恶意殴打一个小孩；一个逃跑的抢劫犯通常不能被背后射击。除了这些极端例子外，在美国，这条规则通常以相对宽松的方式适用，承认在紧张时刻不是每个决定都能完美衡量。举个令人不安的例子，尽管一枪理论上可能就能制止威胁，但很少有人因向一名武装罪犯射击半个弹匣而惹上麻烦。对于那些对自卫持保留意见的国家，比如英国，比例原则通常会被更加细致地剖析。
- en: The final element, found only in some judicial systems, is the *duty to retreat.*
    The law may compel the victim to try to get away from the assailant, allowing
    the use of force only if there’s no safe way to escape. In the United States,
    such laws are fairly rare. As far as I can tell, no state requires you to run
    away from your own home, but a limited duty to retreat in other situations is
    present in several states in the Northeast, plus in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Nebraska,

- en: Blunt instruments, from baseball bats to iron pipes, make for another popular
    home defense pick. They’re especially fashionable in some of the more restrictive
    parts of Europe, kept with the hope of telling the authorities that you’re just
    an avid amateur plumber or a big fan of baseball. The problem with blunt instruments
    is mostly that they’re only as menacing as the person wielding them. Another drawback
    is that lacking a sharp blade, a pipe or a bat can be easily grabbed and possibly
    wrestled away. Solutions to this problem have been proposed, such as putting a
    sock or a stocking over the implement—but I’d wager that the real-world efficacy
    of this life hack isn’t what it’s cracked up to be.

  zh: 钝器，从棒球棒到铁管，是另一种流行的家防选择。它们在欧洲一些更为严格的地区特别流行，通常是为了告诉当局你只是一个热衷的业余水管工或者棒球的大粉丝。钝器的问题主要是它们的威胁程度仅仅取决于持有者。另一个缺点是，由于没有锋利的刀刃，管子或棒球棒容易被抓住，甚至可能被扭走。为了解决这个问题，有人提出过一些解决方案，比如将袜子或长袜套在工具上——但我敢打赌，这种生活窍门在现实中的效果并没有想象中的那么好。
- en: 'The next popular defense tools are old-fashioned ranged weapons: crossbows
    and bows. A bow takes skill to load and aim, but a crossbow has a point-and-click
    interface not very different from a gun. Both weapons are deadly, especially when
    equipped with broadhead arrows or bolts meant for hunting. That said, the main
    problem with these weapons is that they’re incredibly clunky. If you hear knocking
    on the door at 11 PM, it may be weird to greet a neighbor or a police officer
    while holding a cocked crossbow in your hand. Another problem is the abysmal rate
    of fire. If you miss your first shot, or if you’re dealing with multiple assailants,
    you’re hopelessly exposed for the four to eight seconds it takes to reload.'

  zh: 下一个受欢迎的防御工具是传统的远程武器：弩和弓。弓箭需要技巧来装载和瞄准，而弩则有类似枪支的瞄准与发射接口。两种武器都非常致命，特别是当它们装备了用于狩猎的宽刃箭或弩箭时。也就是说，这些武器的主要问题在于它们非常笨重。如果你在晚上11点听到敲门声，手持已拉紧的弩迎接邻居或警察可能会显得有些奇怪。另一个问题是极其低的射击速度。如果你错过了第一次射击，或者面对多名袭击者，你将无助地暴露在四到八秒的重新装填时间内。
- en: 'This brings us to more modern ranged weapons: firearms. Although not as lethal
    as commonly imagined (for handguns, only about 20 percent of gunshot injuries
    treated in hospitals end in death),^([4](b02.xhtml#c26-endnote-4)) firearms are
    perceived as far more intimidating than machetes, baseball bats, crossbows, and
    the like. For this reason, they’re remarkably good at resolving conflicts without
    having to fire a single shot. Just as interestingly, when a shot must be fired,
    most assailants are stopped in their tracks even if the injury isn’t immediately
    disabling or life-threatening. The effect may be at least partly psychological.
    Heavy intoxication or unusual agitation can blunt this instinct and cause assailants
    to keep coming at the victim despite being shot multiple times.'

  zh: 这引出了更现代的远程武器：火器。尽管火器并不像人们常想的那样致命（例如手枪，只有大约20%的枪伤患者最终死于医院治疗），^([4](b02.xhtml#c26-endnote-4))但它们被认为远比砍刀、棒球棍、弩等武器更具威慑力。正因如此，它们在没有开枪的情况下，能非常有效地解决冲突。同样有趣的是，当必须开枪时，即使伤害不立即致命或无法行动，大多数袭击者也会停下脚步。其效果至少部分来源于心理作用。严重的醉酒或异常的激动情绪可能会削弱这种本能，导致袭击者在被多次射中后仍继续向受害人发起攻击。
- en: Of course, access to firearms is heavily regulated in much of the world. That
    said, even in regions customarily painted with a single brush, the permitting
    regimes vary quite significantly. For example, Finland, Switzerland, and Germany
    enjoy surprisingly high firearm-ownership rates compared to many of their neighbors.
    Still, the United States is unique in its recognition of the right for individuals
    to own firearms without the need to give a reason or otherwise actively qualify.

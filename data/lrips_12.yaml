- en: As Laurie ran out of the bank, a fat policeman grabbed her by the collar. “Got
    you!” he said. “Why are you running? Did you rob the bank, too?”

  zh: 当劳里从银行跑出来时，一个胖警察抓住了她的衣领。“抓到你了！”他说。“你为什么跑？你也抢了银行吗？”
- en: “What? Who are you? Let me go!” Laurie yelled.

    Ipsum, *if* that is your real name, I arrest you on charges!”

  zh: “我是警官Custody，而*你*现在麻烦大了，”警察说。“Lauren Ipsum，*如果*那真是你的名字，我因涉嫌犯下罪行而逮捕你！”

  zh: “什么罪名？你在说什么？”

    “Charges!”

  zh: “这不重要！”Custody在劳里的耳边大喊，一边把她摇晃。 “罪名！”
- en: “Ow! But *what* charges?” Laurie repeated. The officer’s hold on her was painful.
    People on the street were starting to point and stare. If there ever were a time
    Laurie wished she could disappear like a Steganosaurus, it was now!

  zh: “哎呀！可是*什么*罪名？”劳里重复道。警察抓住她的手腕，疼得让她忍不住皱眉。街上的人们开始指指点点地看着她。如果有任何时刻，劳里希望自己像一只斯特加诺龙一样消失，那就是现在！
- en: “You’re going to be difficult? Let’s do it nice and proper, if you insist!”
    Custody took out a roll of paper and cleared his throat.

  zh: “你要坚持做难缠的人吗？如果你坚持的话，那就按规矩来吧！”Custody掏出一卷纸，清了清嗓子。
- en: “Lauren Ipsum, you are hereby under arrest for Attempted Mythology, Counterfeiting
    Fair Coins, *two* counts of Impersonating a Composer, Hacking in the Third Degree,
    and Miscellaneous Mopery with Intent to Creep!”

  zh: “Lauren Ipsum，因涉嫌尝试神话学、伪造公正硬币、*两项*冒充作曲家的罪行、三级黑客攻击罪，以及蓄意变态行径杂项行为，特此逮捕！”
- en: “Let me go! You’re the creep!” Laurie tried to twist away, but his grip was
    too strong. Just then, a shout rang out from the crowd.

    boots, black gloves, and an eyepatch in the shape of a heart.

  zh: 一个看起来很强悍的女人走上前与警察对峙。她穿着大靴子，戴着黑手套，眼睛上戴着一只心形眼罩。
- en: “This isn’t a girl, Losesome. This is a dangerous criminal! She broke through
    our perimeter security,” Custody said.

  zh: “这不是一个女孩，Losesome。这是个危险的罪犯！她突破了我们的外围安保，”Custody说道。

    you just made that up.”

  zh: “*不行*，”他说道，“她符合今天下午那个黑客的描述！”
- en: “So you are saying a child was able to get through all of your super-duper security?”
    the woman said, arching an eyebrow skeptically.

  zh: “所以你是说一个孩子居然能突破你们的超高安全性？”那女人一挑眉，怀疑地说。

  zh: 到现在，警察拘留部的Custody已经彻底迷糊了。“这个小女孩……她是为*你*工作的吗？”
- en: “Of course. She’s helping me test the security of this place. And if a *child*
    can run circles around you . . .” She shook her head. “Let’s just say, it doesn’t
    look good.”

  zh: Custody突然冒出一层汗水。他松开了劳里的手，拿出一块手帕擦了擦额头。

    you.”

  zh: “嘿，现在，这真的是个无心之过！我不知道她为Col—嗯，你工作。”

    by the arm and walked away, head held high.

  zh: “现在你有了。现在我们要走了。来吧，劳雷尔。”那女人挽着劳里的胳膊走开，抬头挺胸。
- en: “Let’s just walk away slowly,” the woman whispered. “When we turn the corner,
    try to make it to the marina before Custody starts using his brain instead of
    his mouth.”

  zh: “我们慢慢走开，”那女人低声说道。“当我们转过那个拐角时，尽量在‘监护’开始动脑子而不是动嘴巴之前赶到码头。”

  zh: “我可是多面手，女孩。”温索姆说道。“至于这艘船，我算是偷的。不过我*诚实地*偷的！”

    into even more trouble.

  zh: “你怎么能*诚实地*偷东西呢？”劳里担心自己会陷入更大的麻烦。
- en: “I used to be a deckhand on this boat,” she said. “The Boss made me do all of
    the dirty work. ‘Losesome, replace the main mast!’ he’d say. ‘Put a new rigger
    on the widdershins!’”

  zh: 温索姆展开了帆。
- en: “But secretly, I was saving all the old parts I replaced. They were going to
    the trash anyway, so might as well keep them, right? Once I collected enough pieces,
    I quit, and then I put them back together into a boat. Boss never found out, either!
    The boat he has is all replacement parts. A copy. I have the *real* one.”

  zh: “不过我偷偷地保存了所有替换下来的旧零件。反正它们都要扔掉，不如留着，对吧？等我收集到足够的零件，我就辞职了，然后把它们重新组装成一艘船。老板从来没发现！他那艘船都是替换零件，完全是复刻版。而我有*真正的*船。”

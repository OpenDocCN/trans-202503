- en: The Android team consisted, from the beginning, of people with the right skills
    and drive to build what was needed. Creating an entire platform, along with the
    applications, services, and infrastructure that Android needed, was a huge effort,
    and demanded strenuous effort by people who could dive in quickly to make things
    work.

    to hit the ground running. Having worked on related platform and mobile projects
    at companies like Be, Danger, PalmSource, WebTV, and Microsoft, gave them the
    technical grounding in exactly the right domains to know how to approach similar
    problems that Android presented.

- en: The Android team grew as it approached 1.0, but only to a size of about 100
    people by the time of that first release. This meant that everyone had more than
    enough work to do to ship the product. But people did what they needed to do to
    move the work forward, including individuals owning large areas of functionality
    as well as working across multiple areas, wherever help was needed. Coupled with
    the startup environment that pushed everyone to work insanely hard in those early
    years, the team was able to write Android from scratch and deliver a robust platform
    and device in time to become relevant in the nascent smartphone industry.

  zh: 随着接近1.0版本发布，Android团队的规模有所增长，但在首次发布时，团队人数仅有大约100人。这意味着每个人都有足够的工作任务来发布产品。但大家做了必要的工作来推动进展，包括个人负责大型功能领域，并跨多个领域工作，无论哪里需要帮助。再加上那个早期的创业环境推动每个人拼命工作，团队能够从零开始编写Android，交付一个强大的平台和设备，及时在初生的智能手机行业中占有一席之地。

- en: “I said ‘No. With 300 people, you couldn’t—you need 20 people.’ That larger
    team is riding on the code and practices built by the individuals that had consensus
    by default. In the early days, with all of the communication and coordination.
    . . . If you start with a big team, you spend all of your time debating.”

- en: Great teams benefit from great leadership to help everyone gel and drive forward
    together. One aspect of that leadership was sheltering Android and running it
    like a startup inside the big mothership of Google. Another aspect was having
    decisions being made by a single person, not by a group of people.

    and the product continuing to move toward the goal. It was making a decision,
    even if it’s not the right one, but just a decision to move the ball forward.
    You can’t steer if you’re not moving.”

    the go-to place for the latest electronics, knickknacks, and components. That
    changed in January 2007, when I first set eyes on the SEG Electronics Market in
    Shenzhen. SEG is eight floors of all the components a hardware addict could ever
    want, and only later did I learn that it’s just the tip of the Hua Qiang electronics
    district iceberg.

    this gave us a better reception with factories in China; they seemed more willing

    no question in any factory’s mind that this was a competitive situation. Anybody

    a piece of leather onto a soft plastic frame. In that situation, as you sew the
    leather on, the frame distorts slightly and stretches the leather out, creating

    in the seams and contributes to the final shape of the case. I challenge someone

  zh: PCH 中国解决方案在中国提供西式管理和质量控制对我们 Chumby 来说非常重要。如果我们遇到供应商问题，PCH 会立刻派人到工厂了解情况——没有电话往返，没有快递拖延。而且在中国，当你亲自上门时，工厂老板通常会非常响应。
- en: 'Thus, Chumby’s approach to the quality conundrum was holistic. We started by
    having an engineer (me) at the factory almost on day one to survey the situation.
    It’s important to learn what the factory can and cannot do. I looked at what was
    being built on the line and what techniques were used. Then, when it came time
    to engineer the product, I tried to use the processes and techniques that were
    most comfortable for the factory. When I had to do something new (and any good,
    innovative product will need to), I picked my battles and focused on them, because
    anything new would be a multiweek challenge to get right. This strategy applies
    to even the smallest details: if the factory shrink-wraps goods in plastic, and
    you want to wrap your product in paper, then plan to focus heavily on developing
    the paper-wrapping process, because it’s quite possible that none of the line
    workers at your factory of choice have even seen a paper-wrapped product before.'

  zh: 因此，Chumby 解决质量难题的方法是全方位的。我们从一开始就让一名工程师（我）驻厂，调查现场情况。了解工厂能做什么，不能做什么是非常重要的。我查看了生产线上的构建情况以及使用的技术方法。然后，在产品设计阶段，我尽量使用那些工厂最熟悉的流程和技术。当我需要做一些新事情时（任何好的创新产品都需要做一些新的事情），我会挑选最重要的部分集中精力攻克，因为任何新事物都会是一个几周的挑战，直到做得正确。这种策略甚至适用于最小的细节：如果工厂习惯用塑料收缩膜包装产品，而你想用纸包装你的产品，那么你需要计划重点开发纸包装的过程，因为很可能你的目标工厂的生产线工人从未见过纸包装的产品。
- en: Of course, when developing a new process for the chumby, I preferred to be in
    the factory, and I still do. There’s nothing like standing on the line and showing
    the workers who will be building your device how it should be made. For example,
    I personally trained the chumby assembly-line workers on how to attach a piece
    of copper tape to the LCD assembly to form a proper EMI shield.

  zh: 当然，在为 Chumby 开发新工艺时，我更倾向于亲自到工厂去，我至今依然如此。没有什么能比站在生产线上，亲自向将要组装你设备的工人们展示如何制作它更有效了。例如，我亲自培训了
    Chumby 的生产线工人，教他们如何将铜胶带附着到 LCD 组件上，形成适当的 EMI 屏蔽。
- en: It’s difficult to describe the intricacies of how to fold tape across a complex
    piece of sheet metal to ensure it makes good electrical contact to the grounding
    surfaces without risking a short circuit to other components. Subtleties like
    the fact that the adhesive on one side is a poor insulator also require a basic
    understanding of physics that line workers simply don’t have. Worse yet, explaining
    these concepts requires technical words that your translator might not even know.

  zh: 很难描述如何将胶带折叠在复杂的金属板上，以确保它与接地表面良好接触，同时避免与其他组件发生短路。像胶带一面粘合剂是较差的绝缘体这样的细节，也需要一定的物理学基础，而这正是生产线工人通常没有的知识。更糟糕的是，解释这些概念需要一些技术术语，可能你的翻译员根本不理解这些词汇。
- en: In my case, even a good 3D drawing or photograph of the finished assembly couldn’t
    have gotten the whole concept across, because the stiffness of the tape required
    a particular motion to fold without tearing. Describing the process remotely,
    approving samples via photographs, and ultimately approving a unit delivered via
    FedEx might have taken a couple of weeks, but standing in front of a group of
    workers and demonstrating the process firsthand took only a few minutes. And despite
    the language barrier, I could tell from their facial expressions and body language
    whether they understood the importance of a particular step. Given those cues,
    I immediately reviewed processes that were ambiguous or difficult to master.

  zh: 就我而言，即使有一个很好的 3D 图纸或完成品的照片，也无法完全传达整个概念，因为胶带的刚性要求特定的动作才能正确折叠而不撕裂。远程描述这个过程，通过照片批准样品，最终通过
    FedEx 批准一个单元，可能需要几周时间，但站在一群工人面前亲自演示过程，只需几分钟。尽管存在语言障碍，我仍然能从他们的面部表情和肢体语言中看出他们是否理解某个步骤的重要性。根据这些线索，我会立刻回顾那些含糊不清或难以掌握的过程。
- en: Typically, when you can demonstrate a process at this level of detail and intimacy,
    the workers will get it right within hours, instead of weeks. This is part of
    the reason I spent so much time in China during the development of the chumby’s
    manufacturing process.

    if I wasn’t there to tweak and approve on the spot, because every single tweak
    involved sending something almost round-trip through FedEx. After going through

- en: Given the difficulty of overseeing operations in China from the United States,
    remote electronic monitoring of the products’ test results was essential. For
    the chumby, I developed a set of testers that programmed, personalized, booted,
    verified, and measured every device off the assembly line. All data from the testing
    process was recorded to a log, and at the end of the day, the log was transferred
    to a server in the United States.

  zh: 由于从美国远程监督中国的操作困难，远程电子监控产品的测试结果变得至关重要。对于Chumby，我开发了一套测试仪器，它们负责编程、个性化、启动、验证和测量每一台生产线上的设备。所有来自测试过程的数据都会记录在日志中，到了当天结束时，日志会传输到美国的服务器。
- en: 'This data let me debug a plethora of problems on the floor. I could tell if
    an operator at a particular tester was having trouble with their barcode scanner.
    I also immediately knew if there was a yield problem that day, or if the throughput
    was slower than expected. It was very powerful to have this home-grown audit capability
    in place, because the factory knew I was watching them. In fact, having such a
    capability in place can make relationships with the factory run better: the factory
    eats the cost of yield problems (at least initially), so they appreciate it when
    the design engineer can offer expedient advice and help before any problems get
    out of hand.'

    at the factory. For example, at the chumby’s PCB factory, the first pass of final
    inspection was done manually— one person went over every circuit board, and then
    with the help of a cardboard template, another operator ensured that no components
    were missing. The units then went on to automated testing.

- en: Periodically, both PCH and the factory also performed Restriction of Hazardous
    Substances (RoHS) testing on chumby units to ensure that there was no contamination
    with a specified set of potentially harmful chemicals, including lead. RoHS is
    a hazardous chemical safety standard required in Europe but, ironically, not in
    the United States. Factories routinely do this test on all products, even those
    only shipping to the United States, because latent contamination on the line could
    prevent other products manufactured on the same line from shipping to Europe.

  zh: 定期地，PCH 和工厂也会对 chumby 单元进行有害物质限制（RoHS）测试，以确保没有与指定的一系列潜在有害化学物质（包括铅）污染。RoHS 是欧洲要求的有害化学物质安全标准，但具有讽刺意味的是，美国并没有这一要求。工厂通常会对所有产品进行此项测试，即使这些产品仅销往美国，因为生产线上的潜在污染可能会导致其他产品无法运往欧洲。

    button, causing huge frustration for players. This problem only exhibited itself

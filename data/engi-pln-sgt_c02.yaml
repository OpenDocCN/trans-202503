- en: Communication isn’t unique to the human species, but telecommunication is. Sharing
    information beyond a shouting distance requires plenty of innovation. Many of
    humankind’s most significant developments have been ways of sending and receiving
    messages across expanses. From smoke signals and carrier pigeons to GPS and the
    internet, telecommunications have profoundly shaped the ways we live, work, and
    play.

  zh: 通信并非人类物种独有，但电信则是。超出呼喊范围的信息共享需要大量的创新。人类历史上许多重要的发展都与跨越广阔空间传递和接收信息的方式有关。从烟雾信号、信鸽到GPS和互联网，电信深刻地塑造了我们的生活、工作和娱乐方式。
- en: This chapter explores how we send and receive information over long distances,
    and, most important, the infrastructure that makes it all possible—or at least
    it does at the time of writing. No other part of society seems to be changing
    more rapidly than our communications technologies. In 10 years, this chapter may
    seem outdated. In 20 years, the technology described here may be unrecognizable.
    It is already easy to take such systems for granted in the Information Age, but
    captivating details still exist in the engineering behind how we transfer and
    share knowledge, entertainment, and so much more.

    utilities. Chapter 1 provides a look at utility poles for electricity distribution,
    but that’s not their only use. Joint poles are those shared among multiple utilities.
    Not every joint pole supports every kind of utility, but no matter which lines
    run along the pole, all their locations are carefully prescribed. Primary electrical
    distribution lines run along the tops of the poles, farthest from the ground since
    they have the greatest potential for danger. The secondary electrical lines that
    service customers run directly below them. Between the electrical and communications
    lines is a safety space reserved for utility workers to make connections and perform
    maintenance without being exposed to the danger of high-voltage lines. The communication
    space is the lowest along the poles, because these lines don’t pose a shock hazard
    and require more frequent maintenance.

    along poles, only three make up the preponderance of what you can observe on a

- en: Stringing wires across long distances can create significant tension forces,
    and most communication lines aren’t meant to support their own weight as they
    span from pole to pole. Instead, a steel messenger wire provides this needed support.

  zh: 跨越长距离架设电缆会产生显著的拉力，而大多数通信线路并不设计为支持其自身的重量，尤其是在它们从一个电线杆延伸到另一个电线杆时。相反，钢制的支撑线提供了所需的支撑。通信电缆通过绑缚固定在支撑线上，或者在8字型电缆的情况下，支撑线被并入到保护性外包皮中。
- en: Although the network of copper lines that make up the *plain-old telephone service*
    (*POTS*) are quickly being phased out, they still can be seen on poles around
    the world. Since 1876, we’ve been transmitting voice signals along dedicated circuits
    of copper wire, and it’s still the simplest way for a home or business to connect
    to the telephone network in many places. Each landline consists of a twisted pair
    of thin copper wires. Since every household and business can have its own direct
    lines to the *local telephone exchange*, the cables can grow quite large, sometimes
    containing hundreds or thousands of pairs. The lines join together into larger
    and larger cables at splices, easily visible by the boxy black splice enclosures
    seen near poles.

  zh: 尽管构成*传统电话服务*（*POTS*）的铜线网络正在迅速被淘汰，但它们仍然可以在全球的电线杆上看到。自1876年以来，我们一直通过专用的铜线电路传输语音信号，这仍然是许多地方家庭或企业连接电话网络的最简单方式。每一条固定电话线路由一对扭绞的细铜线组成。由于每个家庭和企业都可以直接连接到*本地电话交换局*，因此电缆可能会变得相当庞大，有时包含数百或数千对电线。电缆在接头处汇集成更大更大的电缆，这些接头常常被电线杆附近黑色的接头盒所标示。
- en: All these wires running in parallel alongside each other would naturally create
    electromagnetic interference and “cross-talk” between circuits. However, twisting
    each pair of wires in a phone line creatively solves this problem because the
    undesired interference affects each wire of the twisted pair equally. The desired
    communications signal is sent in the voltage difference between the two wires
    of the twisted pair, so any unwanted voltage common to both wires is subtracted
    out.

  zh: 所有这些并排运行的电线自然会在电路之间产生电磁干扰和“串音”。然而，通过巧妙地将每一对电话线电缆扭绞在一起，解决了这个问题，因为不需要的干扰会均等地影响每一根扭绞对中的电线。所需的通信信号通过扭绞对两根电线之间的电压差传输，因此任何对两根电线共同作用的不希望出现的电压都会被消除。
- en: Another ubiquitous telecommunication medium is the cable TV network (often abbreviated
    as *CATV*). Despite the name, most CATV networks support telephone and high-speed
    internet service in addition to television programming. Like POTS, the CATV network
    begins at a central location, which is called the *head-end*. From there, the
    signals are distributed mostly using coaxial cable, named because the inner conductor
    and surrounding metal shield are concentric around a common axis. These cables
    can carry high-frequency radio signals with very low losses or issues with interference
    because of the shielding effect of the outer conductor. They start as large trunks
    that feed multiple distribution lines. Amplifiers (also called *line extenders*
    and recognizable by their heat-dissipating fins) are spaced along trunks to boost
    the signal. A catv power supply provides the necessary power for all the amplifiers
    within a large radius. Taps in the distribution lines allow the connection of
    drops, which provide service to each individual customer. CATV trunks and distribution
    lines are easily recognizable by their expansion loops. These loops are present
    because coaxial cables are rigid, and they expand and contract with changes in
    temperature at a different rate than the messenger wire. Without room for thermal
    movement, they can suffer undue stresses and deterioration and even pull themselves
    out of connections.

  zh: 另一种广泛使用的电信介质是有线电视网络（通常缩写为*CATV*）。尽管名字如此，大多数CATV网络除了电视节目外，还支持电话和高速互联网服务。像普通电话服务（POTS）一样，CATV网络从一个中央位置开始，这个位置称为*头端*。从那里，信号主要通过同轴电缆分发，同轴电缆得名于其内部导体和周围的金属屏蔽层是围绕一个共同的轴心同心排列的。这些电缆能够携带高频无线电信号，且由于外部导体的屏蔽效应，信号损失非常低，干扰问题也很少。它们起初是大型的干线，向多个分配线路供电。放大器（也叫*线路扩展器*，其特点是有散热鳍片）沿着干线间隔放置，以增强信号。一个有线电视电源为大范围内所有放大器提供所需的电力。分配线路上的分接头允许连接掉线线，进而为每个单独的客户提供服务。CATV的干线和分配线路因其扩展环而易于识别。这些环的存在是因为同轴电缆比较刚性，随着温度变化，其膨胀和收缩的速度与电线的传导线不同。如果没有足够的空间来应对热膨胀，它们可能会遭受过度的压力和损坏，甚至可能将自己从连接处拉出来。
- en: Both cable and telephone providers now often use fiber-optic cables in combination
    with copper wires or coaxial cables to distribute higher quality and more reliable
    signals. These cables utilize bundles of glass or plastic fibers to transmit signals
    as pulses of light. Fiber-optic signals can travel huge distances with very little
    loss because they are immune to electromagnetic interference. The outside of the
    cable sometimes includes an orange or yellow marker or overwrap, making it easy
    to distinguish from telephone or CATV.

  zh: 现在，电缆和电话提供商通常将光纤电缆与铜线或同轴电缆结合使用，以分发更高质量和更可靠的信号。这些电缆利用一束束玻璃或塑料纤维以光脉冲的形式传输信号。由于光纤信号不受电磁干扰，它们可以在很远的距离上传输而几乎没有信号损失。电缆的外部有时会有橙色或黄色的标记或包覆，便于与电话或有线电视电缆区分。
- en: Fiber-optic networks are usually designed to allow for future expansion by including
    more fibers than needed. However, a major challenge with these cables is that
    they are difficult to splice. Rather than a simple physical connection required
    for an electrical splice, fiber-optic cables need much more care to avoid scattering
    or reflection of the light signal. The individual fibers must be stripped, cleaned,
    cleaved, aligned, and precisely joined, often using heat to fuse them together.
    Instead of performing this careful operation on a ladder or in a bucket truck,
    many utilities prefer to add new connections or repair their fiber-optic cables
    in specialized *splicing trucks*. That means the cables need enough slack to be
    lowered to the ground, and these slack loops are usually stored along the main
    cable. Fiber-optic cables cannot have sharp bends or twists, which could break
    the fibers, so storage brackets (often simply called *snowshoes* for their distinctive
    appearance) allow changes in direction and storage of slack without causing damage
    to the cable.

  zh: 光纤网络通常设计时会留出未来扩展的空间，通过预设更多的光纤。然而，这些电缆的一个主要挑战是它们很难进行拼接。与电气拼接所需的简单物理连接不同，光纤电缆需要更加小心，以避免光信号的散射或反射。每根光纤必须剥离、清洁、切割、对齐并精确连接，通常需要使用热量将它们熔接在一起。为了避免在梯子上或吊车中进行这种精细操作，许多公用事业公司更愿意在专门的*拼接车*中增加新的连接或修复光纤电缆。这意味着电缆需要足够的松弛量，以便将其降到地面，这些松弛的环通常存储在主电缆旁边。光纤电缆不能有急剧的弯曲或扭曲，这可能会折断光纤，因此存储支架（通常因其独特的外观被称为*雪鞋*）可以在不损坏电缆的情况下改变方向并储存松弛量。

    clutter to the landscape. Finally, they are protected from a whole host of threats
    including birds, squirrels, wind, ice, sunlight, and errant vehicles crashing

- en: 'Underground utilities are usually placed inside protective ducts installed
    in one of two ways: *trenching* or *directional boring*. Trenching is accomplished
    using an excavator to dig a linear hole (that is, a trench) in the ground. The
    duct is placed within the hole, which is then backfilled with soil. Warning tape
    is installed while backfilling to mark the presence of the cable to anyone who
    may be excavating around the line in the future. Some of these tapes even include
    wires or steel ribbons so that they can be detected from the ground surface, making
    it easier to locate the line in the future. The major disadvantage of trenching
    is the disruption caused to anything on the surface. The area must be closed off

- en: Directional boring reduces the disturbance on the surface by installing ducts
    inside a borehole without a trench. This method is especially advantageous for
    getting lines across rivers, congested urban areas, and critical roadways where
    it wouldn’t be feasible to use a trench. A directional drill rig on the surface
    first bores a pilot hole between the entrance pit and the exit. Workers use sensing
    equipment on the drill string and at the surface to monitor the drill’s path belowground.
    To steer the drill, the leading edge of the string is asymmetric. It can be clocked
    to any position, and the string will naturally wander in the preferred direction
    during drilling. Once the pilot hole is complete, the drill string is retracted
    with a reamer to enlarge the bore while pulling the duct from a spool, creating
    a continuous path for cables to run.

    from a radio transmitter. The transmitter is usually located away from the tower
    inside an environmentally controlled transmitter building. For AM radio stations,
    the tower itself is the antenna and there may be a tuning hut at the tower base
    that houses equipment needed to efficiently transfer power from the transmitter
    to the tower. For FM and TV stations, the feed line (also called a transmission
    line) carries the signal from the transmitter up to the antenna, which is attached
    to the tower structure. In colder areas, the horizontal run of feed line from
    the transmitter building to the tower is protected from falling ice by an ice
    bridge. The *antenna* is the device that radiates the signal as electromagnetic
    waves. Since towers are fairly expensive and obtrusive, they are often shared
    among many stations or other users (called *colocation*). Tower owners lease space
    inside the transmitter building and on the tower structure to radio and television
    stations, police and fire departments, government agencies, and various private
    companies for their own wireless communication systems.

    Luckily, there is another way to get an antenna high in the sky. Satellites are
    devices placed into orbit around the Earth using rockets. They are the pinnacle
    of wireless communications, at least in terms of range. Many satellites can transmit
    and receive radio signals from one-third of the globe simultaneously, considerably
    farther than even the tallest towers. These days we use satellites for a wide
    variety of communications, including radio, television, internet, telephone, navigation,
    weather, environmental monitoring, and so much more. Satellites used for communications
    are essentially relays, receiving signals from one location on the ground and
    amplifying and redirecting them back to somewhere else on Earth. This relay creates
    a communications channel that does not require a direct connection through wires
    and that isn’t so limited in range by the curvature of the Earth like ground-based

- en: 'Communication satellites can be placed into a wide variety of orbits around
    the Earth. The speed at which a satellite orbits is directly related to its *altitude*.
    The higher the orbit, the longer it takes to go around. Satellites in low-Earth
    orbit circle the globe many times per day, so they are overhead a specific location
    for only short periods of time. A group of satellites in overlapping orbits, called
    a constellation, is required to maintain continuous service. Each satellite is
    strategically placed so that any location on the ground has at least one satellite
    within line of sight at all times. Low-Earth orbiting satellites require less
    power to transmit and receive, and communications experience less delay, since
    they are closer to the Earth. They also do not require a large antenna to receive
    their signals. In fact, you probably carry an antenna in your pocket that regularly
    pings low-Earth satellites: the *GPS* antenna in your cell phone. However, low-Earth
    satellites do have to account for Doppler shift. Because the satellites move so

    in a fixed position in the sky as the Earth rotates. Although it takes considerable
    effort to launch into an orbit so high above the Earth, geostationary satellites
    have some significant advantages. Because they don’t move relative to the ground,
    antennas can be mounted in a fixed position, simplifying their design. Geostationary

    signals and focus them into the feedhorn. This metal cone transitions the waves
    into the low-noise block, the heart of the satellite antenna that includes electronic
    circuitry to perform two primary functions. First, it amplifies the weak radio

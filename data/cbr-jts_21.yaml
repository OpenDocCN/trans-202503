    shinobi should use cover to go undetected. They may wait for circumstances in
    which cover exists or, if necessary, create those circumstances themselves. The
    scrolls provide a wide range of situations that can aid infiltration, from natural
    occurrences (strong winds and rain) to social gatherings (festivals, weddings,
    and religious services) to shinobi-initiated activity (releasing horses, causing
    fights, and setting fire to buildings).^([1](b01.xhtml#endnote-145)) Regardless
    of their source, a canny shinobi should be able to capitalize on distractions,
    excitement, confusion, and other conditions that divert the target’s focus.

    For instance, heavy rainstorms meant empty streets, poor visibility, and torrents

    bad weather is bad for everyone, and the second poem of the *Yoshimori Hyakushu*
    notes that too strong a storm can overpower a shinobi, making it difficult to
    execute tactics and techniques: “In the dead of night, when the wind and rain
    are raging, the streets are so dark that shinobi cannot deliver a night attack

- en: Shinobi also capitalized on other, more personal circumstances, such as a tragic
    death in the target’s family. The scrolls point out that while a target is in
    mourning, they may not sleep well for two or three nights, meaning the shinobi
    may approach unnoticed during the funeral or bereavement disguised as a mourner,
    or wait to infiltrate until the target finally sleeps deeply on night three or

- en: Of course, a shinobi’s mission did not always coincide with providence. In some
    cases, shinobi took it upon themselves to cause severe illness at the target fortification.
    Sick people were ineffective defenders, and their worried caregivers were preoccupied
    and denied themselves sleep to tend to the ill. When the afflicted began to recover,
    the relieved caregivers slept heavily, at which point shinobi infiltrated. Alternatively,
    shinobi could destroy critical infrastructure, such as a bridge, and then wait
    for the target to undertake the large and difficult reconstruction project in
    the summer heat before infiltrating an exhausted opponent.^([5](b01.xhtml#endnote-149))

- en: Effective distractions could also be more directly confrontational. *Bansenshūkai*
    describes a technique called *kyonin* (“creating a gap by surprise”) that employs
    the assistance of military forces or other shinobi. These allies make the target
    think an attack is underway, perhaps by firing shots, beating war drums, or shouting,
    and the shinobi can slip in during the confusion. When the shinobi wanted to exit

    creates opportunities a threat actor can exploit. We will identify various opportunities

  zh: 对抗性机会
- en: Cybersecurity adversaries may distract their targets and create conditions that
    make detecting infiltration as widely—and wisely—as shinobi once did. For example,
    when cyberdefenders detect a sudden distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack,
    standard operating procedures require evaluating the strength and duration of
    the DDoS and creating a security incident ticket to log the activity. Defenders
    may not immediately suspect a DDoS as cover for a threat actor’s attack on the
    network. So when the attack overwhelms the target’s security sensors and packet
    capture (pcap) and intrusion detection or prevention systems (IDS/IPS) fail to
    open—in other words, when there is too much communication to inspect—defensive
    systems might naturally rush the packet along without searching it for malicious
    content. When the DDoS ceases, the defenders will note that there was no significant
    downtime and return their status to normal, not realizing that, while the DDoS
    lasted only 10 minutes, the packet flood gave the adversary enough time and cover
    to compromise the system and establish a foothold in the network. (As in *Yoshimori
    Hyakushu* 2*,* which warned that a strong storm could hinder both target and attacker*,*
    the adversary is unlikely to deploy an overly intense DDoS. Doing so could cause
    networking gear to drop packets and lose communication data—including their own
    attacks. Instead, an attacker will likely throttle target systems to overwhelm
    security without disrupting communication.)

  zh: 网络安全对手可能会分散其目标的注意力，并创造条件，使得像忍者曾经做的那样广泛且明智地检测到渗透。例如，当网络防御者检测到突然的分布式拒绝服务（DDoS）攻击时，标准操作程序要求评估DDoS的强度和持续时间，并创建一个安全事件单来记录该活动。防御者可能不会立即怀疑DDoS是威胁行动者攻击网络的掩护。因此，当攻击压倒目标的安全传感器和数据包捕获（pcap）及入侵检测或防御系统（IDS/IPS）未能开启时——换句话说，当有太多通信无法检查时——防御系统可能会自然地将数据包匆忙传送而不检查是否含有恶意内容。当DDoS攻击停止时，防御者会注意到没有显著的停机时间，并将其状态恢复正常，而没有意识到，虽然DDoS只持续了10分钟，但数据包洪流给了对手足够的时间和掩护来攻破系统并在网络中建立立足点。（如*《吉盛百首》*第2章所警告的那样，“强烈的风暴可能阻碍目标和攻击者”，对手不太可能部署过于强烈的DDoS攻击。这样做可能会导致网络设备丢失数据包并失去通信数据——包括他们自己的攻击。相反，攻击者更可能限制目标系统的性能，以压倒安全防护，而不干扰通信。）
- en: Adversaries have many other ways to create favorable circumstances in the infiltration
    target; they are limited only by their ingenuity. It could be advantageous to
    attack service and infrastructure quality and reliability, such as by disrupting
    ISPs or interconnections. Patient attackers could wait for commercial vendors
    to release faulty updates or patches, after which the target’s security or IT
    staff temporarily creates “permit any-any” conditions or removes security controls
    to troubleshoot the problem. Threat actors might monitor a company’s asset acquisition
    process to determine when it moves new systems and servers to production or the
    cloud—and, hence, when these targets might be temporarily unguarded or not properly
    configured against attacks. Threat actors might also track a corporate merger
    and attempt to infiltrate gaps created when the different companies combine networks.
    Other adversaries might use special events hosted in the target’s building, such
    as large conferences, vendor expos, and third-party meetings, to mingle in the
    crowd of strangers and infiltrate the target. They might even pick up a swag bag
    in the process.

  zh: 对手有很多其他方法可以在渗透目标中创造有利的环境，他们仅受限于他们的聪明才智。攻击服务和基础设施的质量与可靠性可能会带来优势，例如破坏互联网服务提供商（ISP）或互联互通。耐心的攻击者可能会等待商业供应商发布有缺陷的更新或补丁，之后目标的安全或IT团队可能暂时创建“允许任何-任何”条件或移除安全控制以排除故障。威胁行为者可能会监控公司的资产获取过程，以确定何时将新系统和服务器迁移到生产环境或云端——从而知道这些目标可能会暂时没有防护或未正确配置以防范攻击。威胁行为者也可能会追踪公司合并，并尝试渗透不同公司合并网络时产生的漏洞。其他对手可能会利用目标建筑内举办的特殊事件，例如大型会议、供应商博览会和第三方会议，在陌生人中间混入人群并渗透目标。他们甚至可能在过程中顺便拿到一个纪念品袋。

  zh: 对抗的困境
- en: It is considered infeasible to guarantee 100 percent uptime of digital systems,
    and it should be considered even harder to guarantee 100 percent assurance of
    security at all times for those same digital systems. Furthermore, it is almost
    certainly impossible to prevent disasters, hazards, accidents, failures and unforeseen
    changes—many of which will create circumstances in which opportunistic threat
    actors can infiltrate. Being overly cautious to avoid these circumstances can
    hamper a business’s ability to be bold in strategy and execute on goals. A solution
    to this dilemma may be to redundantly layer systems to reduce infiltration opportunities.
    Security teams might put in place the equivalent of high-availability security—security
    that is layered redundantly where systems are weaker. *Practice awareness and
    preparation.* As part of security staff protocols for change management, events,
    incidents, crises, natural disasters, and other distracting or confusing circumstances,
    train your security team to look for indications that an event was created or
    is being used by adversaries to infiltrate the organization. Document role responsibilities
    in organizational policies and procedures. Use threat modeling, tabletop exercises,
    and risk management to identify potential distractions, then consider safeguards,
    countermeasures, and protections for handling them.

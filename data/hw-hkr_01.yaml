  zh: 制造业的冒险
- en: 'I first set foot in China in November 2006\. I had no idea what I was walking
    into. When I told my mother I was going to visit Shenzhen, she exclaimed, “Why
    are you going there? It’s just a fishing village!” She wasn’t wrong: Shenzhen
    was just a town of 300,000 back in 1980, but it had exploded into a megacity of
    10 million in less than 30 years. Between my first visit and the time I wrote
    this book, Shenzhen gained an estimated 4 million people—more than the population
    of Los Angeles.'

  zh: 我第一次踏上中国的土地是在2006年11月。当时我完全不知道自己将面对什么。当我告诉母亲我要去深圳时，她惊讶地说：“你为什么要去那里？那只是个渔村！”她没有错：1980年深圳只有30万人口，但不到30年，它已经爆炸性地发展成一个拥有1000万人的大都市。从我第一次到访到我写这本书时，深圳增加了大约400万人口——比洛杉矶的人口还多。
- en: In a way, my understanding of manufacturing over the years has mirrored Shenzhen’s
    growth. Before going to China, I had never mass-produced anything. I didn’t know
    anything about supply chains. I had no idea what “operations and logistics” meant.
    To me, it sounded like something out of a math or programming textbook.

  zh: 从某种程度上讲，我多年来对制造业的理解与深圳的成长相映成趣。在去中国之前，我从未大规模生产过任何东西。我对供应链一无所知，也不明白“运营和物流”意味着什么。对我来说，这听起来像是数学或编程课本中的内容。
- en: Still, Steve Tomlin, my boss at the time, charged me with figuring out how to
    build a supply chain suitable for our hardware startup, Chumby. Sending a novice
    into China was a big risk, but my lack of preconceived notions was more of an
    asset than a liability. Back then, venture capitalists shunned hardware, and China
    was only for established companies looking to build hundreds of thousands of units
    of a given product. My first set of tours in China certainly supported that notion,
    as I primarily toured mega-factories serving the *Fortune* 500.

  zh: 尽管如此，我当时的老板Steve Tomlin还是让我负责弄清楚如何为我们的硬件创业公司Chumby建立一个合适的供应链。把一个新手派到中国是一个大风险，但我缺乏先入为主的观念反而成为了我的优势，而不是负担。那时候，风险投资家避开硬件，中国只是为那些希望生产数十万件产品的成熟公司服务。我在中国的首次考察确实印证了这一观点，因为我主要参观了服务于*财富*500强公司的大型工厂。
- en: Chumby was lucky to be taken under the wing of PCH International as its first
    startup customer. At PCH, I was mentored by some of the finest engineers and supply
    chain specialists. I was also fortunate to be allowed to share my experiences
    on my blog, as Chumby was one of the world’s first open hardware startups.

  zh: Chumby很幸运成为PCH International的首个创业客户，并在其庇护下发展。在PCH，我得到了来自一些顶尖工程师和供应链专家的指导。我也很幸运能够在我的博客上分享我的经历，因为Chumby是全球首批开放硬件创业公司之一。
- en: Although meeting the minimum order volumes of our conventional manufacturing
    partners was a constant struggle, I kept noticing small things that didn’t square
    with conventional wisdom. Somehow, local Chinese companies were able to remix
    technology into boutique products. The so-called shanzhai integrated cell phones
    into all kinds of whimsical forms, from cigarette lighters to ornamental golden
    Buddha statuettes (more on this in [Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04)). The niche nature
    of these products meant they had to be economical to produce in smaller volumes.
    I also noticed that somehow factories were able to rapidly produce bespoke adapter
    circuits and testing apparatuses of surprisingly high quality in single-unit volumes.
    I felt there was more to the ecosystem—a story that was being told over and over
    again—but few had the time to listen, and those who did heard only the parts they
    wanted to hear.

  zh: 尽管与传统制造合作伙伴达到最低订单量一直是一个不断挣扎的问题，但我总是注意到一些与传统智慧不符的小细节。不知怎么的，当地的中国公司能够将技术重新组合成精品产品。所谓的山寨将手机技术融入到各种各样古怪的形态中，从打火机到装饰用的金色佛像（更多内容见[第4章](ch04.xhtml#ch04)）。这些产品的利基性质意味着它们必须在小批量生产中具有经济效益。我还注意到，工厂居然能够快速生产定制的适配器电路和测试设备，而且在单件生产中质量出奇地高。我觉得这个生态系统还有更多的故事在讲述着，但很少有人有时间去倾听，而那些听的人也只是听到他们想听的部分。
- en: The financial crisis of 2008 changed everything. The consumer electronics market
    was crushed, and factories that were once too busy printing money were now swimming
    in excess capacity. I made friends at several medium-sized factories in the area.
    I started to inquire about how, exactly, these factories were able to so nimbly
    produce their internal test equipment, and how shanzhai were able to prototype
    and build such bespoke phones.

  zh: 2008年的金融危机改变了一切。消费电子市场遭遇重创，曾经忙得不可开交的工厂，现在却有了过剩的生产能力。我在当地几家中型工厂交了朋友，开始询问这些工厂是如何如此灵活地生产内部测试设备的，山寨厂又是如何设计和生产定制手机的。
- en: The bosses and engineers were initially reticent, not because they wanted to
    hide potential competitive advantages from me, but because they were ashamed of
    their practices. Foreign clients were full of corporate process, documentation,
    and quality procedures, but they also paid dearly for such overhead. Local companies
    were much more informal and pragmatic. So what if a bin is labeled “scrap”? If
    the bits inside are suitable for a job, then use them!

  zh: 这些老板和工程师最初都很犹豫，不是因为他们想隐瞒潜在的竞争优势，而是因为他们对自己的做法感到羞愧。外国客户充满了公司流程、文档和质量程序，但他们也为这些管理开销支付了高昂的费用。当地公司则更加非正式和务实。那么，垃圾箱上标着“废品”又怎样呢？如果里面的零件适合某个工作，就用它们！
- en: I wanted in. As an engineer, tinkerer, and hacker, I cared a lot about the cost
    to produce a few units, and a couple of minor assembly defects was nothing compared
    to the design issues I had to debug. I eventually managed to coax a factory into
    letting me build a part using its low-quality but ultra-cheap assembly process.

  zh: 我想参与其中。作为一个工程师、改装者和黑客，我非常关心生产少量单元的成本，而几个小的组装缺陷相比我必须调试的设计问题根本不算什么。最终，我设法说服一家工厂，让我使用其低质量但超便宜的组装工艺来制造一个零件。
- en: The trick was to guarantee that I would pay for all the product, including defective
    units. Most customers refuse to pay for imperfect goods, forcing the factory to
    eat the cost of any part that isn’t exactly to specification. Thus, factories
    strongly dissuade customers from using cheaper but low-quality processes.

  zh: 诀窍是保证我会支付所有产品的费用，包括有缺陷的单元。大多数客户拒绝为不完美的商品付款，这迫使工厂承担任何不符合规格的部分的成本。因此，工厂强烈劝阻客户使用便宜但低质量的工艺。
- en: Of course, my promise to pay for defective product meant there was no incentive
    for the factory to do a good job. It could have, in theory, just handed me a box
    of scrap parts and I’d still have had to pay for it. But in reality, nobody had
    such ill intentions; as long as everyone simply tried their best, they got it
    right about 80 percent of the time. Since small-volume production costs are dominated
    by setup and assembly, my bottom line was still better despite throwing away 20
    percent of my parts, and I got parts in just a couple of days instead of a couple
    of weeks.

  zh: 当然，我承诺支付有缺陷的产品意味着工厂没有动力做好工作。理论上，它完全可以给我一箱废品，而我依然需要为此支付费用。但实际上，没有人有这种恶意；只要每个人尽力而为，他们的准确率大约是80%。由于小批量生产的成本主要由设备调试和组装构成，尽管丢弃了20%的零件，我的最终支出还是更划算，而且我能在几天内拿到零件，而不是几周。
- en: Having options to trade cost, schedule, and quality against each other changes
    everything. I’ve made it a point to discover more alternative production methods
    and continue shortening the path between ideas and products, with ever more options
    along the cost-schedule-quality spectrum.

  zh: 具有在成本、进度和质量之间进行权衡的选项，改变了一切。我一直致力于发现更多的替代生产方法，并继续缩短从想法到产品之间的路径，同时在成本-进度-质量的范围内提供更多的选择。
- en: After Chumby, I decided to remain unemployed, partly to give myself time for
    discovery. For example, every January, instead of going to the frenzied Consumer
    Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, I rented a cheap apartment in Shenzhen and
    engaged in the “monastic study of manufacturing”; for the price of one night in
    Las Vegas, I lived in Shenzhen for a month. I deliberately picked neighborhoods
    with no English speakers and forced myself to learn the language and customs to
    survive. (Although I’m ethnically Chinese, my parents prioritized accent-free
    fluency in English over learning Chinese.) I wandered the streets at night and
    observed the back alleys, trying to make sense of all the strange and wonderful
    things I saw going on during the daytime. Business continues in Shenzhen until
    the wee hours of the morning, but at a much slower pace. At night, I could make
    out lone agents acting out their interests and intentions.

  zh: 在Chumby之后，我决定保持失业状态，部分原因是为了给自己留出时间进行发现。例如，每年一月，我不去拉斯维加斯那个喧闹的消费电子展（CES），而是租了一个便宜的公寓住在深圳，进行“修道院式的制造研究”；用一晚在拉斯维加斯的消费，我可以在深圳住一个月。我特意选择了没有英语使用者的街区，迫使自己学习语言和风俗以便生存。（虽然我有中国血统，但我的父母更注重英语流利且没有口音，而非学习中文。）我在晚上四处游荡，观察小巷，尽量理解白天所见的所有奇怪而精彩的事情。深圳的商业活动一直持续到凌晨，但速度较慢。夜晚，我能看到孤独的代理人们在表现他们的兴趣和意图。
- en: If there’s one thing those studies taught me, it’s that I have a lot more to
    learn. The Pearl River Delta ecosystem is incomprehensibly vast. As with the Grand
    Canyon, simply hiking one trail from rim to base doesn’t mean you’ve seen it all.
    I have, however, picked up enough knowledge to build a custom laptop and to develop
    a new process for peel-and-stick electronic circuits.

  zh: 如果说那些研究教会了我什么，那就是我还有很多东西需要学习。珠江三角洲的生态系统广阔得难以理解。就像大峡谷一样，单单走一条从山脊到山底的小径并不意味着你已经看到了它的一切。然而，我确实学到了足够的知识，能够组装一台定制笔记本电脑，并开发出一种新的“揭皮粘贴”电子电路的制作工艺。
- en: In this part of the book, you’ll follow my journey as I learned the Shenzhen
    ecosystem over the years, via a remix of blog posts that I wrote along the way.
    Some of the essays are reflections on particular aspects of Chinese culture; others
    are case studies of specific manufacturing practices. I conclude with a chapter
    called “The Factory Floor,” a set of summary recommendations for anyone considering
    outsourced manufacturing. If you’re in a hurry, you can skip all the background
    and go directly there.

  zh: 在这本书的这一部分，你将跟随我多年来学习深圳生态系统的历程，这些内容是我在过程中写的博客文章的再创作。有些文章是对中国文化特定方面的反思；其他则是对特定制造实践的案例研究。我最后总结了一章，名为“工厂车间”，这是为考虑外包制造的任何人提供的一套总结性建议。如果你时间紧迫，可以跳过所有背景内容，直接阅读这一部分。
- en: However, hindsight is 20/20\. Once you’ve walked a path, it’s easy to point
    out the shortcuts and hazards along the way; it’s even easier to forget all of
    the wrong turns and bad assumptions. There’s no one-size-fits-all method for approaching
    China, and my hope is that by reading these stories, you can come to your own
    (perhaps different) conclusions that better serve your unique needs.

  zh: 随着三星和其他制造商开始在全球销售自家的安卓设备，随着Droid的发布，销量的上升迅速且持续增加。
- en: When the Droid launched, in late 2009, Android was comfortably at the bottom
    of the heap of smartphone platforms. By the end of 2010, just over one year later,
    Android devices were outselling all of them except Nokia’s Symbian OS, and they
    passed Symbian as well in the following year.

  zh: 当Droid在2009年末发布时，安卓平台在智能手机平台中处于较低的位置。到2010年底，也就是一年多后，安卓设备的销量已经超越了除了诺基亚的Symbian
    OS之外的所有平台，并且在第二年又超过了Symbian。

    自2011年以来，安卓设备的销量已经超越了个人电脑，并且自2015年以来，它们的销量是个人电脑的四倍以上。^([5](#c47-footnote-5))
- en: This comparison seems, at first, perplexing; PCs (desktops and laptops of all
    makes and models) have been a requirement of modern life for decades. But many
    people in the world consider a PC as a luxury item, not a necessity; the first
    computing device they purchase is a smartphone. Smartphones, unlike PCs, have
    become *essential*; they satisfy that sweet spot of filling a need that people
    have (for communication, navigation, entertainment, business, or whatever) while
    being affordable enough that people who could not previously justify purchasing
    a computer could buy in to the smartphone world. They are also personal in a way
    that the “personal computer” never was; PCs tend to be shared equipment in a household,
    whereas most smartphones are used by only one person, which makes the potential
    market for these devices much larger than the market for PCs ever could be.

  zh: 乍一看，这个对比似乎让人困惑；个人电脑（各类台式机和笔记本）几十年来一直是现代生活的必需品。但世界上许多人把个人电脑视为奢侈品，而非必需品；他们购买的第一台计算设备是智能手机。智能手机与个人电脑不同，已经成为了*必需品*；它们满足了人们的各种需求（如通信、导航、娱乐、商务等），同时价格足够亲民，使得以前无法承担电脑的人也能够购买智能手机。智能手机也具有个人化特点，而“个人电脑”却并非如此；个人电脑通常是家庭共享设备，而大多数智能手机只有一个人使用，这使得智能手机的潜在市场远远大于个人电脑的市场。

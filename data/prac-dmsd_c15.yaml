    built on the banks of rivers or other natural water sources, and even if municipal
    pumps or rural wells grind to a halt, relatively little infrastructure is needed
    for water trucks to get on the road. But this sentiment lacks nuance. Nowadays,
    tens of millions of people live in arid regions where water needs to be hauled
    from hundreds of miles away, and even in temperate climates, suburban sprawl puts
    many families far from the nearest river or lake. Some disasters—ranging from
    nuclear accidents to storms that overwhelm sewage treatment plants—can spoil surface
    water too. As for water trucks, their ability to reach all families in need depends
    on the condition of area roads and bridges, both of which can be rendered impassable
    by earthquakes and other natural cataclysms.

- en: This concludes the treeware version of *The Book of I*^(*2*)*C*. However, this
    is only the beginning of your journey toward learning how to program I²C devices.
    There are hundreds of different I²C devices in the real world, with more appearing
    all the time. No matter how many devices I describe in this book, it will eventually
    become out of date as manufacturers create new devices.

  zh: 这标志着《I*2*C之书》的纸质版的结束。然而，这只是你学习如何编程I²C设备旅程的开始。现实世界中有成百上千种不同的I²C设备，而且新的设备不断涌现。无论本书描述多少种设备，最终都会过时，因为制造商不断推出新设备。
- en: 'Indeed, as this book was being edited, two new and important devices arrived:
    the MCP4728 quad DAC and the Raspberry Pi Pico. That’s in addition to the many
    common devices already on the market, with boards produced by Adafruit, SparkFun,
    Seeed Studio, and others.'

  zh: 事实上，在本书编辑过程中，出现了两个新的重要设备：MCP4728四通道DAC和树莓派Pico。这些设备是市场上已存在的许多常见设备之外的新增设备，包括由Adafruit、SparkFun、Seeed
    Studio等公司生产的开发板。
- en: As discussed in the introduction, to keep the page count and cost of this book
    reasonable, I’ve chosen to move the discussion of several devices onto my website
    at [https://www.randallhyde.com/bookofi2c](https://www.randallhyde.com/bookofi2c).
    Chapters 17 and beyond of this book will appear on that site, making them easy
    to update and extend as time permits and new devices become popular. Appendix
    B in this book describes currently planned online chapters, but I intend to add
    more in the future. Please visit the website to find additional support material,
    expanded example code, and links to other information on I²C programming.

  zh: 如在前言中所述，为了保持本书的页数和成本合理，我决定将多个设备的讨论移至我的网站 [https://www.randallhyde.com/bookofi2c](https://www.randallhyde.com/bookofi2c)。本书的第17章及之后的内容将会发布在该网站上，这样便于随着时间的推移和新设备的流行进行更新和扩展。本书的附录B描述了当前计划中的在线章节，但我计划将来会增加更多内容。请访问该网站查找额外的支持材料、扩展的示例代码，以及其他I²C编程相关的信息链接。
- en: Even without the online materials, this book has taught you almost everything
    you need to know to begin using I²C peripherals. At this point, you should be
    able to read through a device’s datasheet and use that information to program
    any I²C device out there. Good luck, and happy programming!

  zh: 即便没有在线材料，本书已经教会你几乎所有开始使用I²C外设所需了解的内容。到目前为止，你应该能够通读设备的数据手册，并使用这些信息编程任何I²C设备。祝你好运，编程愉快！

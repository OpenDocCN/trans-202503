- en: Water is a fundamental human need, but its cleanliness is just as important.
    Even before the advent of modern municipal engineering, many civilizations had
    developed strategies for delivering fresh water to urban areas and removing wastewater
    to prevent it from contaminating water sources. In the 19th century, as cities
    worldwide began to grow in population and density, the threat to public health
    from waterborne diseases became more menacing and insidious. The science of sanitation
    developed as a necessity to keep city-dwellers safe from plague and pestilence.
    Now nearly all cities and towns have complex systems for delivering abundant and
    clean water to their citizens and disposing of sewage. Although easy to take for
    granted, the development and maintenance of municipal water and wastewater systems
    are massive undertakings, requiring a lot of infrastructure. Much of the pipes
    and valves in cities are buried below the ground, but you can observe many facilities
    and equipment if you know where to look.

  zh: 水是人类的基本需求，但其清洁度同样重要。即使在现代市政工程出现之前，许多文明已经开发出将淡水输送到城市区域并去除废水的策略，以防止其污染水源。19世纪，随着全球城市人口和密度的增长，水传播疾病对公共健康的威胁变得更加严重和隐蔽。卫生学作为一项科学应运而生，成为保护城市居民免受瘟疫和传染病侵害的必要手段。现在几乎所有城市和城镇都有复杂的系统来为市民提供充足和清洁的水源，并处理污水。虽然这一切容易被视为理所当然，但市政水务和污水系统的开发与维护是庞大的工程，涉及大量基础设施。城市中的许多管道和阀门都埋在地下，但如果你知道在哪里寻找，还是可以看到许多设施和设备的。

    starts its journey in a river, stream, creek, lake, or reservoir. These sources
    are collectively known as *surface waters* (as opposed to groundwater resources,
    which are discussed in the next section). Collecting water from a river or lake
    might seem straightforward; however, many engineering challenges are associated
    with transitioning the flow from a surface water source into a pipeline or *aqueduct*
    to be delivered to its destination. *Intake structures* perform this critical
    task. They can be associated with an impoundment or diversion (for example, at
    a dam), but intakes are often standalone structures, and you’ll see them near
    riverbanks, lakes, or reservoirs if you keep an eye out.

  zh: 我们用于饮用、清洁和灌溉农作物的大部分水源，开始时都来自河流、小溪、湖泊或水库。这些水源统称为*地表水*（与接下来章节讨论的地下水资源相对）。从河流或湖泊收集水似乎很直接；然而，将地表水源的水流引入管道或*渡槽*，并将其输送到目的地，涉及许多工程挑战。*取水结构*执行这一关键任务。它们可能与水库或引水设施（例如大坝）相关联，但取水口通常是独立的结构，如果你留心观察，会在河岸、湖泊或水库附近看到它们。
- en: Lake or reservoir intakes often consist of large concrete or masonry towers
    (as discussed in Chapter 6). Complicating matters, a structure considered an *outlet*
    at a dam might also serve as an *intake* for a pumping station or aqueduct. Older
    structures called crib intakes were  constructed onshore, floated into place,
    and then filled with rubble. A central shaft carries water by gravity through
    the intake to a tunnel below the lake where it can be pumped to treatment and
    distribution facilities on the shore.

  zh: 湖泊或水库的取水口通常由大型混凝土或砖石塔构成（如第六章所述）。更复杂的是，在大坝处被认为是*排放口*的结构，可能也会作为泵站或渡槽的*取水口*。以前被称为“格架取水口”的旧结构是建造在岸上，浮到指定位置后，再用碎石填充。一个中央轴承通过重力将水从取水口引入到湖泊下方的隧道，水随后被抽送到岸上的处理和分配设施。
- en: Although complete removal of contaminants and sediment is usually performed
    later, the engineering of intakes includes making sure that the source water entering
    a pipe is as clean as possible to reduce the burden on downstream water treatment
    plants. This untreated water is often known as *raw water*. In reservoirs and
    lakes, the volume of suspended sediments, the quantity of microorganisms like
    plankton and algae, and even the temperature of the water can vary significantly
    with depth. Thus, most intake structures on lakes and reservoirs have openings
    (or *ports*) at multiple levels so that operators can select the ideal mixture
    of water from the depths within the lake or reservoir. Gates on the various openings
    can be opened or closed depending on the conditions within the source water and
    the needs downstream.

  zh: 尽管污染物和沉积物的完全去除通常在后期进行，但进水口的工程设计包括确保进入管道的源水尽可能清洁，以减轻下游水处理厂的负担。这种未经处理的水通常被称为*原水*。在水库和湖泊中，悬浮沉积物的体积、浮游生物和藻类等微生物的数量，甚至水温，都可能随深度显著变化。因此，大多数湖泊和水库的进水结构都有多个不同高度的开口（或*端口*），以便操作人员可以从湖泊或水库的不同深度中选择理想的水源混合物。各种开口上的门可以根据源水的状况和下游的需求进行开启或关闭。
- en: Intakes on rivers contend with a different set of challenges. First, the level
    in a river can vary significantly. In addition, river intakes must contend with
    the fact that streams are dynamic systems. Floods can move massive quantities
    of sediment, changing the location and shape of banks and even altering the course
    of a river altogether. River intakes are almost always located either on a straight
    section of the channel or on the outside of a bend. Sediment tends to deposit
    on the inside of curves where flows are slower, so engineers avoid those locations
    where an intake could be clogged more readily. Bank intakes are installed on a
    riverbank to allow water to flow laterally into the structure. However, the deepest
    part of a natural channel (called the *thalweg*) is often in the center, so bank
    intakes often require dredging of the riverbed to allow water to flow when the
    river level is low. This dredging is not only disruptive to the sensitive environment
    of a river, but it must be performed regularly as sediments in the river deposit
    over time.

  zh: 河流的进水口面临一套不同的挑战。首先，河流水位可能变化很大。此外，河流进水口还必须应对河流是动态系统这一事实。洪水能够搬运大量沉积物，改变河岸的位置和形状，甚至可能完全改变河流的流向。河流进水口几乎总是位于河道的直段或弯道的外侧。沉积物往往沉积在弯道的内侧，因为那里水流较慢，因此工程师会避免选择容易被堵塞的地方。岸边进水口通常安装在河岸上，以允许水横向流入结构。然而，天然河道的最深部分（称为*河床*）通常位于中央，因此岸边进水口往往需要进行河床疏浚，以便在水位较低时仍能保证水流。这种疏浚不仅会对河流敏感的环境造成干扰，而且必须定期进行，因为河流中的沉积物会随时间沉积。
- en: One solution to the challenges of varying water levels and sediment buildup
    is constructing a small *weir* downstream. Such a structure raises the water level
    in the river while also slowing down the flow so that sediment can settle out.
    However, weirs create an impediment to navigation and migratory wildlife, and
    they can be quite dangerous (as discussed in Chapter 6), so their use has fallen
    out of favor. Modern intake structures on rivers make use of careful siting to
    avoid problems with sedimentation and lower water levels while minimizing environmental
    impacts. One alternative to bank intakes involves running a conduit from a deeper
    section of the channel to the shore, often performed using tunneling to avoid
    the need for trenching in the natural riverbank. A screen on the end of the conduit
    prevents fish or debris from entering the line, and a gate controls the flow.

  zh: 解决水位变化和沉积物堆积问题的一种方法是下游建造一个小型*堰*。这种结构提高了河流中的水位，同时减缓了水流速度，使沉积物可以沉降。然而，堰对航运和迁徙野生动物造成了障碍，并且可能非常危险（如第六章所讨论），因此它们的使用已不再受到青睐。现代河流进水结构通过精心选址来避免沉积物堆积和低水位问题，同时最小化环境影响。岸边进水口的一种替代方案是通过隧道将管道从河道较深的部分延伸到岸边，以避免在天然河岸上开挖。这种管道末端的筛网可以防止鱼类或杂物进入管道，且门控系统可控制水流。
- en: Unless the final destination of the raw water is well below the source, most
    intakes will be accompanied by a *pumping station*, which lifts the water from
    its source into a pipeline or aqueduct. Pumps are often installed directly above
    or adjacent to the intake structure, sometimes within a building called a pump
    house. These structures may be recognizable by built-in gantry cranes that allow
    equipment to be serviced or replaced when needed.

- en: At a pumping station, water flows into ports, through a conduit or tunnel, then
    into a structure called a *sump* (or wet well), which creates enough volume and
    depth for pumps to operate. Sumps must be designed to create ideal flow conditions
    to avoid inefficiencies and damage to the pump. Turbulent and swirling flow in
    a sump can lead to a *vortex,* just like what happens when you drain a bathtub.
    If a vortex is allowed to enter the mouth of the pump column, the air will reduce
    its efficiency and may even cause it to fail. Vortex breakers are sometimes installed
    within sumps to keep the flow from swirling as it is drawn into the pump.

- en: Intakes can represent a severe hazard to swimmers and boaters in rivers and
    lakes because of the submerged structures and fast-flowing water. Where public
    safety may be at risk, owners of intakes often install floating booms to warn
    people of the potential danger. These booms consist of brightly colored floating
    elements linked together with chains. They are anchored to the river or lakebed
    to create an exclusion zone around a dangerous structure. Some booms are even
    designed to be strong enough to hold back debris, floating trees, and ice that
    could damage intake structures. In addition, when an intake or pumping station
    must be located near the bank, armoring (such as *rock riprap*) is usually installed
    to protect against erosion that could threaten the structure.

    seeps down into the ground through the spaces between soil and rock particles.
    Sometimes this groundwater reaches a less permeable geologic layer (called an
    aquitard) and cannot continue downward. Over long periods of time, infiltrating
    water can accumulate into vast underground resources called aquifers. A common
    misconception is that groundwater is stored in open areas like underground rivers
    or lakes. Although they exist in some locations, large underground caverns are
    relatively rare. Nearly all groundwater aquifers are geologic formations of sand,
    gravel, or rock that are saturated with water, just like a sponge. Extracting
    this groundwater for use by humans is the job of a *well*. At their simplest,
    wells are just holes into which groundwater can seep from the surrounding soil.
    However, modern wells utilize sophisticated engineering to provide a reliable
    and long-lasting source of fresh water. Farms use them for irrigation. Rural homes
    and businesses often rely on them when a connection to a municipal distribution
    system is unavailable. And many large cities utilize groundwater as a primary
    source of fresh water for their populations.

  zh: 并非所有降水都会流入湖泊和河流。一些水分会通过土壤和岩石颗粒之间的空隙渗入地下。有时，这些地下水会到达一个渗透性较差的地质层（称为隔水层），并无法继续向下渗透。随着时间的推移，渗透水可以积聚成巨大的地下资源，称为含水层。一个常见的误解是，地下水存储在类似地下河流或湖泊的开放空间中。尽管在一些地方确实存在，但大型地下洞窟相对稀少。几乎所有地下水含水层都是由沙子、砾石或岩石构成的地质层，这些地层像海绵一样被水饱和。提取这些地下水供人类使用的工作由*水井*来完成。最简单的水井就是一个可以让地下水从周围土壤渗入的孔。然而，现代水井利用复杂的工程技术提供可靠且持久的淡水来源。农场用它们进行灌溉。农村的家庭和企业通常依赖水井，当无法连接到市政供水系统时，水井是他们的主要水源。许多大城市也利用地下水作为其居民的主要淡水来源。

    all places have layers of saturated soil or rock below the ground. Still, the
    volume of water, its quality, and the ease of extracting it to the surface depend

    hydrologic system, so groundwater withdrawals may impact the volume and quality
    of surface water resources. Unfortunately, we can’t see below the ground, and
    methods for exploring subsurface geology mainly involve drilling *boreholes*,
    which can be quite expensive. Thus, the availability of groundwater in a specific
    area is usually determined by combining many sources of information, including

    support so that loose soil and rock can’t fall into the well. A screen is attached
    to the casing at the depths where water will be withdrawn. The screen allows groundwater
    to flow into the casing while keeping larger soil and rock particles out of the

- en: Once the casing and screen are installed, the *annular space* (the area between
    the excavated borehole and casing) must be filled. Where the well is screened,
    this space is usually filled with gravel or coarse sand called gravel pack. This
    material acts as a filter to keep fine particles of the aquifer formation from
    entering the well through the screen. The space along unscreened casing is usually
    filled with bentonite clay, which swells to create an impermeable seal so that
    shallower groundwater (which may be lower quality) can’t travel along the annular
    space into the screens. Finally, the uppermost section of the annular space is
    permanently sealed, again using bentonite clay or sometimes using cement grout.
    This seal ensures that contaminants on the surface cannot find their way into
    the well. In a worst-case scenario, pollutants could enter a well and flow into
    the aquifer, contaminating it for other users, so most jurisdictions have strict
    rules for sealing wells at the surface. The casing is usually extended aboveground
    to create a wellhead with a concrete pad extending in all directions to prevent
    damage or infiltration to the well.

    only so much atmosphere is available to balance the weight of a fluid in a suction
    pipe. If you could create a complete vacuum in a straw, the highest you could

    compel water to flow since gravity does all the work. Many aqueducts have very
    gradual slopes such that the incline is practically imperceptible to the eye.
    However, the amount of fluid that can flow by gravity is related to the channel’s

    The flow velocity must be fast enough to minimize settling of silt on the canal
    floor but slow enough to avoid scouring and erosion. The channel also must be

    the evaporation of water into the air or seepage into the soil below. Engineers
    balance these factors when selecting the route a canal will take and the shape
    of the channel along the way. For example, many aqueducts run parallel to rivers
    where the topography naturally descends over long distances, and most canals use
    a trapezoidal cross section with sloped sides that are less likely to collapse.

- en: Selecting the pipe size is another critical decision in the design of a pipeline.
    Smaller pipes are less expensive, but they require water to move faster to achieve
    the equivalent flow of a larger pipe. Water loses energy through friction, and
    these losses increase with velocity, so the money saved by installing a smaller
    pipe might be lost over time from the increased cost of pumping. For long pipelines,
    these frictional losses might be so significant to require booster pumps along
    the way that maintain pressure in the system. As pipes age, their inner surfaces
    get rougher, so engineers must consider the friction and pumping costs through
    the entire lifetime of the pipeline.

  zh: 选择管道尺寸是管道设计中的另一个关键决策。较小的管道成本较低，但它们需要水流得更快才能达到与较大管道相同的流量。水流在管道内摩擦时会损失能量，而这种损失随着流速的增加而增加，因此安装较小管道所节省的钱可能会因为增加的泵送成本而在时间中丧失。对于长管道来说，这些摩擦损失可能会非常显著，以至于需要沿途安装增压泵来维持系统中的压力。随着管道的老化，内部表面会变得更粗糙，因此工程师必须考虑整个管道生命周期中的摩擦和泵送成本。
- en: The mass of fluid in a long pipeline can be enormous, sometimes greater than
    a fully loaded freight train. When all that water is moving through a pipe, it
    has quite a bit of momentum. However, even though it’s a fluid, water isn’t very
    compressible, so closing a valve or stopping a pump gives that momentum nowhere
    to go. Instead, it creates a spike in pressure that travels as a shockwave through
    the pipe, an effect called *water hammer*. These shockwaves can be a problem in
    residential homes when taps close too quickly, resulting in lines knocking in
    the walls. However, in large pipelines that can contain immense volumes of fluid,
    closing a valve quickly can be the equivalent of slamming a freight train into
    a concrete wall. To avoid spikes in pressure that could damage equipment or rupture
    pipes, engineers specify slow-closing valves and pumps that start and stop gradually.
    In situations where operators need rapid control over the flow, surge tanks can
    be installed to absorb the extreme pressure spikes and minimize the damaging effects
    of water hammer.

- en: As the flocs of suspended particles grow, they eventually become heavy enough
    to settle out (the third and final step of sedimentation). Raw water is pumped
    to a basin where it can sit nearly motionless while the flocs fall to the bottom.
    This basin can be as simple as a rectangular concrete box that’s regularly drained
    and cleaned, but many water treatment plants use tanks called clarifiers that
    include mechanisms to collect the solids as they settle at the bottom automatically.
    These circular basins are a recognizable component of many water treatment plants.
    The raw water flows up through the center of the clarifier and slowly makes its
    way toward the outer perimeter, dropping particles that form a layer of sludge
    at the bottom. The clarified water passes over a weir so that only a thin layer
    farthest from the sludge can exit the basin. A scraper pushes the sludge down
    the sloped bottom of the clarifier into a hopper where it can be collected for

    pipes within the system, usually to between two and six times normal atmospheric

    pressure gets stored in tanks or water towers, as discussed in the next section.)
    Pumping stations are usually located within a water treatment plant to send fresh
    water on its way. The pressure that pumps provide not only induces the potable
    water to flow to its destination but also ensures that contaminants can’t enter
    the distribution system through open joints or small holes in the pipes. If leaks
    develop, water will flow out of the pressurized system rather than allow impurities
    or pollutants to enter. High-service pumps used in water distribution systems
    consume significant amounts of electricity, so they often require robust connections

  zh: 清洁水的需求不仅随着一年中的季节性变化显著波动，而且甚至在一天之内也会有很大的差异。城市中的用水量通常在早晨和傍晚最高，因为人们会洗澡、做饭和浇花。此外，城市中一些最严重的用水需求是由火灾引起的，火灾是随机发生的，无论白天还是夜晚。火灾在密集的城市区域可能失控蔓延，因此大多数市政当局确保其水分配系统即使在需求最高的日子里也有足够的储备容量。设计水分配系统的工程师必须在选择泵、管道、阀门和其他设备的大小时，考虑到所有可能的流量变化。水分配系统中最重要的部分之一（也是最明显的部分）是解决饮用水需求变化的方案：储存。
- en: Many steps involved in collecting, moving, purifying, and distributing water
    are most efficient when they happen at a steady rate. At treatment plants, chemical
    feeds and purification processes can’t tolerate sudden changes. In addition, pumps
    used in water distribution systems often run at a single speed. Without somewhere
    to store water, operators would constantly need to ramp production up or down
    to meet changing demands. In addition, all the treatment facilities and pumps
    would need to be sized for peak water needs, even if they were used to their total
    capacity only once or twice per year, increasing their cost and complexity. Tanks
    and reservoirs smooth out the peaks and valleys of water demand, allowing pumps
    and other infrastructure to be operated for average conditions. When usage is
    low (for example, at night), the treatment plant overproduces to fill the tanks.
    When use is high, the stored water can supplement the treatment plant to meet
    water demands.

  zh: 收集、输送、净化和分配水的许多步骤在流量保持稳定时效率最高。在处理厂，化学药剂的添加和净化过程无法容忍突然的变化。此外，用于水分配系统的泵通常以单一的速度运行。如果没有储水的地方，操作员就需要不断地调整生产速度，以适应不断变化的需求。此外，所有的处理设施和泵必须按照最高水需求来设计，即使它们每年只有一次或两次达到最大容量，这也增加了其成本和复杂性。水箱和水库平滑了水需求的峰谷变化，使得泵和其他基础设施可以在平均条件下运行。当用水量低时（例如在夜间），处理厂会过量生产，以填充水箱。当用水量高时，储存的水可以补充处理厂的水源，以满足水需求。
- en: Many types of storage structures are used in water distribution systems. Ground-level
    tanks often consist of large, circular steel or concrete enclosures. If you look
    closely, many tanks include a level indicator on the outside to show the water
    level at a glance. Some cities use ground excavations to form ponds called finished
    water reservoirs that hold significant volumes at a relatively low cost. These
    ponds are often lined with plastic or concrete to prevent leakage and are covered
    to minimize the chance of contamination (although some uncovered reservoirs still
    exist today). Both ground-level tanks and reservoirs can often be seen at water
    treatment plants, where they are known as *clearwells*.

- en: One disadvantage of storing water at ground level is that it is not pressurized
    and therefore must be pumped into a distribution system, fluctuating water demands.
    Tanks or reservoirs are often installed at the tops of hills or mountainsides
    above the area served by the system, allowing storage not only of the water but
    also the energy imparted to it by the pumps. *Elevated storage* smooths the demands
    on pumps, allowing them to run consistently instead of cycling on and off to meet
    changing water demands throughout the day. In some areas where electricity costs
    vary, pumps can run at night when power is cheap to fill up tanks, and be left
    off during peak hours when electricity is more expensive. Elevated storage is
    also beneficial during an electrical outage or emergency, keeping pipes pressurized
    and water flowing even when the pumps or treatment plant is out of service.

    be built. Smaller distribution systems often use tall, narrow tanks called standpipes
    for potable water storage. The water at the top of the tank serves as elevated
    storage just as if it were sitting on a hilltop. The water at the bottom of the
    tank serves as an emergency reserve that can be pumped into the distribution system

- en: The pressure in a body of water is related to the depth below the surface. You
    can imagine a water distribution system as a virtual ocean under which we all
    live. The water surface in elevated storage tanks represents the surface of the
    virtual ocean (called the hydraulic grade line by engineers). Customers at low
    elevations are at the bottom of the virtual ocean, where pressures are highest,
    and customers at high elevations will be near the surface of the virtual ocean
    where pressure is lowest. The ideal depth is usually around 30 to 60 meters (approximately
    100 to 200 feet), which means most water towers are set so that their low and
    high water levels are within this range. Water stored less than 15 meters (around
    50 feet) above the system may not create enough pressure to prevent potential
    contamination. Cities with large changes in elevation sometimes maintain independent
    water distribution networks at different pressures to keep customers within the

- en: A water tower is as simple as a tank connected to a water main. When water demands
    fall below the pump capacity, the pressure in the system goes up, forcing water
    into the tank through the inlet/outlet pipe. When demands rise above the pumping
    rate, the system pressure goes down, and water flows out of the tank through the
    same pipe to supplement water from the treatment plant. Other than water, there’s
    not much inside. Most tanks feature an overflow to prevent them from overfilling.
    Vents make sure that the air pressure in the tank doesn’t change with the water
    level, potentially creating positive or negative pressure that could damage the
    structure. Access hatches provide means for maintenance and inspection inside

    either by the shape of the tank itself or the tower structure on which it sits.
    Single-pedestal tanks and multicolumn tanks are usually made entirely from welded
    steel. Fluted-column tanks are supported by corrugated steel with lots of room
    inside the tower for equipment storage and sometimes even offices. Composite tanks
    sit upon concrete towers, saving the cost of regular painting required for steel
    columns to protect against corrosion. For cities that use elevated storage, these
    tanks are often a central part of operating the entire system. The water level

    However, if the sewage flows too slowly, solids can settle out of suspension and
    build into clogs and constrictions. We can’t adjust gravity up or down to maintain
    this balance of flow velocity, and we also don’t have much control over the volume
    of wastewater (since people flush when they flush). The only factors engineers

- en: Any time the size or direction of a sewer changes and at intersections of pipes,
    a sanitary manhole is installed to provide access for maintenance and inspection.
    Manholes are usually made from vertical concrete enclosures that run up to the
    ground surface. Steps allow personnel to enter and exit. A heavy cast iron plate,
    called a cover, keeps people and debris out of the sewers while allowing vehicles
    to drive over the top. Manholes also sometimes serve as vents to equalize the
    air pressure within the lines and prevent the buildup of toxic gases. When the
    top of a maintenance hole is vulnerable to flooding, cities often require that
    the cover be sealed and bolted shut to exclude rainwater from entering the pipes.
    In this case, vents sometimes extend above the required flood level to keep air
    pressure from building up, even during heavy storms. A temporary ventilation system

    especially toward their downstream ends, making construction costly and time-consuming.
    In some cases, it isn’t feasible to chase the slope of a sewer farther and farther
    below the ground surface. One alternative is to install a pumping station that
    can lift raw sewage from its depths back up and closer to the surface. Lift stations
    can be small installations designed to handle a few apartment complexes or massive
    projects that pump significant portions of a city’s wastewater flow. A typical
    wastewater lift station consists of a concrete chamber called a wet well. Sewage
    flows into the wet well by gravity via the inlet sewer, filling it over time.
    Once the level reaches a prescribed depth, a pump turns on, pushing the wastewater
    into a pipe called a force main. This intermittent operation makes sure that sewage
    is always moving swiftly through the line so that solids don’t settle out of suspension
    during off-peak hours. The sewage travels under pressure within the force main
    to an uphill manhole where it can once again continue its journey downward via
    gravity. Lift stations usually feature multiple pumps so that they can continue

    contaminants that are suspended in the swift and turbulent flow. First, sewage
    flows through a bar screen that filters out large debris like sticks, rags, and
    any other large pieces of detritus that find their way into the sewers. Many technologies

    wastewater are collectively known as *grit*. These materials can damage equipment
    in the plant, so they are usually removed in a separate process during primary
    treatment. Treatment plants use grit chambers, often configured as long narrow
    tanks, to slow down wastewater flow. Within these placid conditions, suspended
    sediments will settle to the bottom of the chamber while the grit-free wastewater
    continues to the outlet. Some grit chambers introduce air bubbles that help fling
    heavier particles to the edges of the tank. Others use a motorized agitator to
    create a vortex in the flow to accomplish a similar feat. A sump at the bottom
    of the chamber collects the settled grit to be pumped away for disposal.

    leaving the grit chamber is still full of suspended solids, but they mainly consist
    of small, organic particles or floating oils and grease (collectively known as

    solids. The large circular tanks slow down wastewater flow even further, allowing
    tiny particles to sink gently while a skimmer collects the solids floating on

- en: Where primary treatment physically separates contaminants from wastewater, *secondary
    treatment* does so using biological processes, replicating what Mother Nature
    would do naturally but in a much shorter time period. Most wastewater treatment
    plants take advantage of microorganisms that can digest organic matter in sewage.
    As they consume contaminants, these bacteria and protozoa clump together, leaving
    relatively clean water behind. The microorganism communities that thrive in oxygen-rich
    (*aerobic*) environments are different from those that live in oxygen-depleted
    (*anaerobic*) environments. These various colonies consume different nutrients
    from the water, so treatment plants often utilize both aerobic and anaerobic conditions
    to remove wastewater contaminants thoroughly. Aerobic conditions are created in
    aeration basins where blowers generate a constant supply of air that passes through
    diffusers, creating tiny bubbles that mix and dissolve oxygen into the water.

  zh: 初级处理通过物理方法将污染物从废水中分离，而*二级处理*则利用生物过程进行分离，模拟大自然母亲的自然过程，但时间要短得多。大多数废水处理厂利用能够消化污水中有机物的微生物。当它们消耗污染物时，这些细菌和原生动物会聚集在一起，留下相对干净的水。适应富氧（*有氧*）环境的微生物群落与生活在缺氧（*厌氧*）环境中的微生物群落不同。这些不同的微生物群体消耗水中的不同营养物质，因此处理厂通常同时利用有氧和厌氧条件来彻底去除废水中的污染物。有氧条件是在曝气池中创造的，鼓风机持续提供空气，通过扩散器形成细小气泡，将氧气混入水中。
- en: Once the biological treatment has consumed most of the nutrients, the cleaned
    water with suspended clumps of microorganisms (called mixed liquor) moves from
    the aeration chamber into a secondary clarifier. Here, the colonies of bacteria
    settle to the bottom, allowing only the clean effluent to be discharged. Depending
    on the regulatory requirements, many treatment plants have tertiary processes
    that target specific contaminants. In addition, most treatment plants perform
    a final disinfection to kill any remaining pathogens in the water. Disinfection
    may be completed using dissolved chlorine, ozone gas, or intense ultraviolet lights,
    which deactivate viruses and harmful bacteria. The final effluent from the treatment
    plant is usually discharged into a natural stream, river, or ocean.

  zh: 一旦生物处理消耗了大部分营养物质，清洁后的水和悬浮的微生物团块（称为混合液）就会从曝气池流入二次沉淀池。在这里，细菌群落沉淀到池底，仅允许清洁的废水被排放。根据监管要求，许多处理厂还会有三级处理流程来针对特定的污染物。此外，大多数处理厂会进行最终消毒，以杀死水中的任何残留病原体。消毒通常使用溶解氯、臭氧气体或强紫外线灯进行，这些方法能使病毒和有害细菌失效。处理厂的最终出水通常会排放到天然溪流、河流或海洋中。
- en: Some of the microorganisms that settle out in the secondary clarifier (known
    as activated sludge) are returned to the aeration chamber to seed the next colony.
    The rest of the sludge must be discarded. Some treatment plants send sludge directly
    to a landfill for disposal. However, sludge is an organic material and will decompose
    over time, releasing unwanted gases like methane into the environment. Rather
    than allow such decomposition to occur in a landfill, many treatment plants use
    digesters to process organic solids. Digesters convert sludge into biogas, which
    can be used as a fuel for heating or electricity generation, and a solid material
    called digestate (or *biosolids*), which can be dried and landfilled or used as
    fertilizer. Digesters often have mixers to keep sludge blended, large domes to
    collect biogas as it is generated, and a flare that serves as a safety measure.
    If too much biogas is created than can be stored, operators will allow the gas
    to combust in the flare, converting the harmful constituents into safer gases
    to be released into the environment.

  zh: 一些在二次沉淀池中沉淀下来的微生物（称为活性污泥）会被送回曝气池，以为下一代细菌群落提供种子。其余的污泥必须被丢弃。一些处理厂将污泥直接送往垃圾填埋场处理。然而，污泥是有机物质，会随着时间的推移分解，释放出甲烷等有害气体。为了避免在垃圾填埋场中发生这种分解，许多处理厂使用消化池处理有机固体。消化池将污泥转化为沼气，沼气可以作为加热或发电的燃料使用，并且会生成一种叫做消化残渣（或*生物固体*）的固体物质，这种残渣可以被烘干后填埋，或用作肥料。消化池通常配有搅拌器，以保持污泥混合，配有大圆顶用于收集生成的沼气，还有一个火炬作为安全措施。如果生成的沼气超过了存储能力，操作人员会允许沼气在火炬中燃烧，将有害成分转化为较为安全的气体排放到环境中。

  zh: 暴雨水收集
- en: 'One of the most significant environmental impacts of cities is how they affect
    the ways water moves above and below the ground during storms. All those streets,
    sidewalks, buildings, and parking lots cover the ground with impervious surfaces
    so that, instead of rainwater infiltrating, it runs off toward creeks and rivers,
    swelling them faster and higher and filling them with more pollution. Where a
    natural watershed acts like a sponge to absorb and slow rainwater as it falls,
    urban watersheds work more like funnels, gathering and concentrating runoff. Stormwater
    and flooding have been a problem ever since people started living in cities, and
    the first solution was simply to get the water out and away as quickly as possible.
    This solution is in the name we still use for how cities manage storms: *drainage*.
    When it rains and when it pours, we try to give that runoff somewhere to go.'

  zh: 城市对环境的最显著影响之一是它们如何影响暴风雨期间水流在地面上方和地下的流动。所有这些街道、人行道、建筑物和停车场覆盖了不透水的地面，因此雨水不再渗透，而是朝着溪流和河流流去，使它们迅速上涨，水位更高，污染物也更多。自然的流域像海绵一样吸收和减缓降雨，而城市流域更像漏斗，收集并集中径流。自从人类开始在城市中居住，暴雨和洪水就一直是一个问题，最初的解决方法就是尽可能快速地把水排出去。这个解决方法就是我们至今使用的城市暴雨管理方式——*排水*。无论是下雨还是倾盆大雨，我们都试图让这些径流找到去处。
- en: Most cities are organized such that the streets serve as the first path of flow
    for rainfall. Individual lots are graded with a slope toward the road so that
    water flows away from buildings where it would otherwise cause problems. The standard
    city street has a crown in the center with gutters on either side for water to
    flow. This keeps the road mainly dry and safe for vehicle travel while providing
    a channel to convey runoff. Eventually, the road will reach a natural low point
    and start back uphill or will have collected so much runoff that it can’t hold
    it all in the gutter. It is possible to let runoff from a street outfall directly
    into a natural watercourse in some cases. However, in dense urban areas where
    space is limited, stormwater is often routed into underground drains.

  zh: 大多数城市的布局使得街道成为降水的首个流向通道。每个地块都会有一定的坡度，向街道倾斜，这样水流就可以远离建筑物，避免产生问题。标准的城市街道中间有一个高点，两侧有排水沟供水流通。这样可以保持道路相对干燥，确保车辆安全行驶，同时也提供了一个排水的通道。最终，道路会达到自然的低点并开始向上坡走，或者会积聚过多的径流，无法完全容纳在排水沟内。在某些情况下，可能允许将街道的径流直接排放到自然水道中。然而，在空间有限的密集城市地区，暴雨水通常会被引导到地下排水管道中。
- en: In the past, it was common to simply put all the runoff from the streets directly
    into the sanitary sewage system. Unfortunately, wastewater treatment plants are
    usually not designed to process massive influxes of combined sewage and stormwater
    runoff at the whims of Mother Nature. In the worst cases, these plants have to
    release untreated sewage directly into watercourses when the inflow is too much
    to be stored or processed. That’s why most cities now separate storm sewers from
    the sanitary sewers used to carry wastewater. Rain usually enters a storm sewer
    system through a curb inlet or surface grate. Inlets are located at all low points
    along a road (called *sags*) and at regular spacing on sloped sections. Many inlets
    include a manhole so that they can be accessed for cleaning and maintenance. A
    storm sewer pipe connects to each inlet to carry rainwater away. Each line is
    sized and sloped for gravity flow according to the expected volume of stormwater,
    similar to how sanitary sewer pipes are designed to carry a specific volume of
    wastewater.

  zh: 过去，通常将街道上的所有雨水径流直接排入卫生污水系统。不幸的是，污水处理厂通常没有设计来处理大规模的合并污水和暴雨径流的涌入，尤其是当大自然的变化无常时。在最糟糕的情况下，当污水流量过大，无法存储或处理时，这些污水处理厂不得不将未经处理的污水直接排放到水道中。这就是为什么现在大多数城市将雨水管道与用于排放污水的卫生污水管道分开的原因。雨水通常通过路缘进水口或地面格栅进入暴雨管道系统。进水口位于道路的所有低洼处（称为*凹陷*）以及坡道段的定期间隔处。许多进水口包括一个检修井口，以便进行清洁和维护。每个进水口都通过暴雨管道与其他进水口连接，将雨水排走。每条管道的尺寸和坡度都是根据预期的暴雨水量来设计的，类似于卫生污水管道的设计，后者也是为了运输特定量的污水。
- en: A storm sewer system converges and concentrates just like a natural system of
    streams and rivers. Eventually, the sewers are routed to an outfall in a natural
    watercourse or the ocean. Energy-dissipating baffle blocks or rock riprap armoring
    are often installed at outfalls to protect the natural soils against erosion from
    the swiftly exiting runoff. Unlike a sanitary sewer system that terminates in
    a treatment plant, most stormwater runoff is discharged directly into the environment,
    so cities often include warnings to the public about disposing of waste in curb
    inlets.

  zh: 暴雨管道系统的汇聚和集中就像自然的溪流和河流系统一样。最终，这些污水管道会被引导到自然水道或海洋的排放口。通常，在排放口处会安装能量耗散挡块或岩石护坡，以保护自然土壤免受迅速排出的径流侵蚀。与卫生污水系统不同，后者的终点是处理厂，大部分暴雨径流都会直接排放到环境中，因此城市通常会向公众发出警告，提醒他们不要将垃圾倾倒到路缘进水口。
- en: Storm sewers help reduce local flooding by quickly removing water from streets,
    conveying it to streams and rivers. However, the influx of stormwater from urban
    areas exacerbates flooding within these natural water bodies. Many cities increase
    the capacity of natural watercourses by enlarging, straightening, and lining them
    with concrete. This design strategy is often known as *channelization*. Speeding
    up stormwater flow through channelization helps reduce the depth and extents of
    flooding, but it also has disadvantages. Dirty concrete channels hurt the visual
    character of a city. Channelization can also worsen flooding downstream and degrade
    the habitat of the original waterway. Most cities recognize that widening and
    lining natural channels is an incomplete solution to the increased runoff from
    urban development.

  zh: 暴雨排水系统通过迅速将水从街道排除并将其引导到溪流和河流，帮助减少局部洪水。然而，城市地区的暴雨水流入这些自然水体会加剧洪水的情况。许多城市通过扩大、直线化和用混凝土衬砌天然水道来增加水道的容量。这种设计策略通常被称为*渠道化*。通过渠道化加速暴雨水流有助于减少洪水的深度和范围，但它也有一些缺点。肮脏的混凝土渠道会破坏城市的视觉形象。渠道化还可能加剧下游的洪水，并破坏原始水道的栖息地。大多数城市认识到，拓宽和衬砌自然水道并不能完全解决城市发展带来的径流问题。
- en: As a result, cities now require developers to take responsibility for their
    own impacts on stormwater volume and quality, which usually involves onsite storage
    before releasing drainage into a watercourse. *Retention ponds* maintain a permanent
    pool of water where detention ponds are ordinarily dry. Both act like mini sponges,
    absorbing all the rain that rushes off the buildings, streets, and parking lots.
    Their outlet structures are designed to slowly release runoff back into waterways,
    shaving off the peak flow rate to the level before all the buildings and parking
    lots were built. Retention and detention ponds also help reduce pollution by slowing
    down the water, so suspended particles can settle out.

  zh: 因此，城市现在要求开发商对其暴雨水量和水质的影响负责，这通常涉及在将排水排放到水道之前进行现场储存。*蓄水池*保持一个永久的水池，而滞洪池通常是干燥的。两者像迷你海绵一样，吸收从建筑物、街道和停车场冲刷而来的雨水。它们的排放结构被设计成缓慢将径流释放回水道，削减峰值流量至所有建筑和停车场建设之前的水平。蓄水池和滞洪池还通过减缓水流速度，帮助减少污染，让悬浮颗粒物沉降。
- en: Along highways, it is not usually economical to manage stormwater below the
    ground. Instead, we often build highways above the natural ground on embankments
    with parallel ditches to carry stormwater. When a roadway crosses over a significant
    stream or river, we often construct a bridge. However, it isn’t cost-effective
    to bridge over every minor channel and topographic depression in the landscape.
    When a roadway intersects with a minor watercourse, a culvert allows water to
    cross below from one side to the other. Engineers select the culvert pipe size
    to reduce the possibility of rainwater overtopping the roadway. Headwalls and
    wingwalls hold the embankment back while guiding stormwater into the culvert.
    A poorly designed culvert can let water through while obstructing the movement
    of animals, so engineers work with biologists and environmental scientists to
    ensure that culverts are appropriately designed for both the water they must carry
    and the creatures that live within it.

  zh: 在高速公路沿线，通常不经济将暴雨水管理埋设在地下。相反，我们常常将高速公路建设在自然地面之上，修筑堤坝，并设置平行沟渠来排水。当一条道路跨越重要的溪流或河流时，我们通常会修建桥梁。然而，架设桥梁跨越每一个小水道和地形洼地并不经济。当一条道路与一个小水道交汇时，管道涵洞可以让水流从一侧下方通过到另一侧。工程师选择涵洞管道的尺寸，以减少雨水溢出道路的可能性。挡土墙和翼墙支撑堤坝，同时引导暴雨水流进入涵洞。设计不良的涵洞可能会让水流通过，但却阻碍动物的迁移，因此工程师会与生物学家和环境科学家合作，确保涵洞在设计时既能满足水流的需求，也能照顾到其中生活的生物。

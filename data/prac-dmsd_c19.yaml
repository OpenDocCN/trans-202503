    attract some scrutiny. A barrel of water in the backyard or a portable generator
    in the garage might be unremarkable in some parts of the country, but in some
    times and places, these items would stand out like a sore thumb. But then, the
    worst-case outcome is having to acknowledge in passing that you’re prepared for
    snowstorms, earthquakes, or hurricanes; there’s no need to go off the deep end
    and bring up monetary system collapses or EMPs.

- en: For a complete set of chainsaw precautions, it’s best to turn to the manual
    or to the safety videos published by the manufacturer. That said, when dealing
    with trees, one of the most important points is that wood is surprisingly elastic
    and that limbs can be under considerable tension—especially if propped against
    vehicles, nearby structures, or other trees. Many chainsaw incidents involve people
    getting knocked off ladders, whacked on the head, or pinned down when a tree snaps
    back or shifts unexpectedly during a cut.

  zh: 要获取完整的链锯安全注意事项，最好参考手册或制造商发布的安全视频。也就是说，在处理树木时，最重要的一点是木材出奇地具有弹性，而且树枝可能承受相当大的张力——尤其是当它们支撑在车辆、附近的建筑物或其他树木上时。许多链锯事故都与人们在树木反弹或在割切过程中发生意外移动时，从梯子上被撞下、头部被打击或被压住有关。
- en: Another significant danger is the kickback from the saw itself, common when
    the tip of the chain bar makes contact with uncut material at an angle of 90°
    or less. This can cause the chainsaw to be propelled toward the operator with
    considerable force, sometimes producing gnarly cuts on the forehead or the extremities.
    Finally, it’s also possible to carelessly lower the chainsaw before the chain
    comes to a complete stop, potentially causing leg injury.

  zh: 另一个显著的危险是链锯本身的反冲，当链条导板的尖端以90°或更小的角度与未割开的材料接触时，这种反冲现象尤为常见。它可能会导致链锯以相当大的力量朝操作员方向弹回，有时会造成前额或四肢的严重割伤。最后，也有可能在链条尚未完全停止的情况下不小心放下链锯，从而可能导致腿部受伤。

    is a flat tire. In some cases, this can be dealt with by using tire plugs, a portable
    compressor, or a Fix-a-Flat type of product containing a sealant in a can—but
    such solutions don’t work for blowouts or major damage to the sidewalls. A more
    reliable solution is to pull out the spare tire, along with a lug wrench and a
    scissor jack. Unfortunately, about a third of new vehicles no longer come with
    a spare, at least not unless you pay extra;^([1](b02.xhtml#c19-endnote-1)) it’s

- en: In cold climates, carrying chains in the winter months is a good plan. Even
    if the roads are well maintained in your part of the woods, the chains come in
    handy if the car skids off the road. For the same reason, carrying a tow strap
    and road flares may be advisable. To deal with electrical malfunctions, it’s also
    good to carry a selection of fuses and spare lamps; once again, these are often
    supplied with the vehicle, but it’s best to double-check. Older vehicles can be
    more temperamental, so some drivers carry everything from extra motor oil, to
    radiator sealants, to replacement serpentine belts. This isn’t always necessary,
    but if you know of any recurring issues with your car, it’s smart to plan ahead.

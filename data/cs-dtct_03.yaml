- en: Frank shook off Officer Notation and left through the back gate of the farm,
    where a large sign faced the road. For years the Crannocks had used this sign
    to broadcast coded messages about various illegal activities. These days it was
    something of a tourist attraction for visiting criminals—a place thugs took their
    younger protégés and gathered to reminisce about stories that invariably began
    “Back in my day . . .”

  zh: Frank摆脱了Notation警官，走出了农场的后门，那里有一块大牌子面朝着路。多年来，Crannock家族一直用这块牌子发布关于各种非法活动的密码消息。如今，这里成了犯罪分子参观的景点——恶棍们带着他们年轻的学徒，聚在一起回忆那些总是以“在我那时候……”开头的故事。
- en: The sign itself was an AnyText model. It held 3 arrays of letters, each array
    with 12 slots. Each letter, space, or punctuation mark took up a single slot in
    an array, meaning the board could hold a total of 36 individual characters—enough
    to advertise a whole range of illegal activities. Every Monday morning, one of
    the Crannocks would drag a basket of letters to the sign and individually place
    the appropriate character in each slot of the array.

  zh: 这块标牌本身是一个AnyText模型。它包含3组字母，每组12个位置。每个字母、空格或标点符号都占用一个位置，这意味着整个标牌最多可以容纳36个字符——足够用来发布一系列非法活动的广告。每周一早晨，Crannock家族的成员会拖着一篮子字母来到标牌前，逐个将合适的字符放入每个位置。
- en: During his first week on the force, Frank’s partner had brought him out here
    to “check the board.” The message at the time—*Apple picker wanted. Got slugs?*—sounded
    innocuous enough to Frank. The Crannocks were looking for an apple picker to help
    with the harvest and were offering to get rid of people’s slugs. When he said
    this to his partner, a 20-year veteran, she laughed.

  zh: 在刚加入警局的第一周，Frank的搭档带他来到这里“查看标牌”。当时的信息是——*苹果采摘者招聘。你有蜗牛吗？*——对Frank来说听起来无害。Crannock家族正在寻找一个苹果采摘者来帮助收获，并且提供处理蜗牛的服务。当他这样告诉他的搭档时，这位拥有20年经验的侦探笑了。

    to look beyond the obvious meaning and see what the criminal mind would see. In
    this case, *Apple picker wanted* indicates that they are trying to hire a petty
    thief. Someone who would steal apples from a cart or such.”

  zh: '“那是他们想让你认为的，”侦探Rossile解释道。“你必须超越表面意思，看看犯罪分子会怎么解读。这个‘苹果采摘者招聘’意味着他们在试图雇佣一个小偷。一个会从车上偷苹果的人，或者类似的。” '

  zh: “非法蜗牛赛跑，”她回答道。“他们每几个月就在这里举办一次比赛。你会慢慢明白的。”
- en: Thus, Frank had learned to check the Crannocks’ board weekly to get a pulse
    on the criminal world. After the first few months, he had learned to decipher
    most of the codes. *Farmhands* meant henchmen, with additional modifiers if strength,
    brutality, or just plain numbers were needed. A *print artist* referred to a forger,
    while a *vocal artist* was a con man, and so forth. The phrase *a flock of chickens*
    had stumped Frank for a few days before Rossile translated it as “a large number
    of warm bodies to run around noisily and cause a distraction; no intelligence
    required.”

  zh: 因此，Frank学会了每周检查Crannock家族的标牌，以便了解犯罪世界的动态。几个月后，他已经学会了破译大部分的密码。*农场工人*指的是打手，如果需要力量、暴力或纯粹的人数，词语后会加上附加修饰。*印刷艺术家*是指伪造者，*声乐艺术家*是指骗子，等等。短语*一群鸡*让Frank困惑了好几天，直到Rossile将其翻译为“大量热腾腾的身体，四处奔跑发出噪音，制造干扰；不需要智慧”。
- en: By the end of his first year, Frank had become an expert at reading the board.
    The only time in the past few years that Frank had a hard time deciphering a criminal
    tip from the board was during the wizard Exponentious’s attack on the kingdom.
    Exponentious had unleashed the Spell of Incorrect Indexes on all the kingdom’s
    ArrayDesignBoards. As its name implied, the spell changed the indexes, so the
    locations Mrs. Crannock thought she was setting the letters to were wrong. For
    a week, the Crannocks’ board held gibberish.

  zh: 到了第一年结束时，Frank已经成为了阅读标牌的专家。在过去的几年里，唯一一次Frank在破译标牌上的犯罪信息时感到困难，是在巫师Exponentious攻击王国的时候。Exponentious施放了“错误索引法术”，使得整个王国的ArrayDesignBoards都出现了问题。顾名思义，这个法术改变了索引位置，因此Mrs.
    Crannock认为她设置字母的位置是错误的。在一周的时间里，Crannock家族的标牌上充满了乱码。

    He puzzled out the message: *Defensive wizard wanted*.'

  zh: 由于魔法只会在数组中打乱字母，而AnyText模型是通过三个独立的数组实现的，弗兰克必须逐行解开每个数组。他解开了信息：*需要防御法师*。

    he had ever seen on the Crannocks’ board. It read *ArrayCarts for rent. No questions*.

- en: Arrays don’t just store lists of numbers; they can also be used to store strings
    of text characters. Many programming languages implement strings using arrays.
    Each block in the array holds a single character, which can be a letter, number,
    symbol, or space. As with arrays of other data, characters in these strings can
    be accessed directly through their index in the array.

  zh: 数组不仅仅用来存储数字列表；它们也可以用来存储文本字符的字符串。许多编程语言使用数组来实现字符串。数组中的每个块存储一个字符，可以是字母、数字、符号或空格。与其他数据类型的数组一样，这些字符串中的字符可以通过其在数组中的索引直接访问。

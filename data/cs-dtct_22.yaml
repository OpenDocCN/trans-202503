- en: Captain Donovan’s office hadn’t changed much in the last five years. The same
    desk sat in the center of the room, its surface clear aside from four baskets
    labeled “In,” “Out,” “To File,” and “To Burn.” A handful of new commendations
    adorned the wall, in addition to the large number Frank already recognized. Only
    the family pictures—charcoal sketches of the captain’s two kids and a family portrait—gave
    any indication of the passage of time.

  zh: 多诺万队长的办公室在过去五年里变化不大。桌子依旧坐落在房间中央，表面上除了四个标有“收件”、“外出”、“归档”和“销毁”的文件篮，几乎没有东西。墙上多了一些新的表彰奖状，除了弗兰克已经认得的那一大堆。只有那些家庭照片——队长两个孩子的木炭素描画和一张全家福，才让人感觉到时间的流逝。

- en: Frank looked at the chairs in front of the captain’s desk and thought back to
    the last time he’d sat in this office—his last day as a cop. He’d finally assembled
    enough evidence to go after Rebecca Vinettee yet again, even if some of his methods
    *had* bordered on dangerously randomized. The captain hadn’t seen it the same
    way, though. His focus has been on Frank’s blatant disregard for protocol rather
    than the new evidence. Pushing back the memory, Frank slumped into the right-hand
    chair and waited.

    running through the thefts. Different stations. Different officers on duty. Even
    different departments.”

  zh: “不知道，”队长说道。“我还没有找到任何线索。盗窃案之间没有共同的特征。不同的站点、不同的值班警员，甚至不同的部门。”
- en: Frank nodded silently while he turned the thefts over in his mind. He had hit
    the same dead end with the internal transfers. There had been at least one new
    transfer on duty for each incident, but never the same officer twice. Frank had
    briefly considered the possibility of a broad conspiracy throughout the entire
    rookie class, but discarded it immediately. Anyone capable of coordinating such
    a massive betrayal would likely have been able to orchestrate more subtle thefts,
    at least something that didn’t involve alerting every station within a hundred
    miles.

  zh: 弗兰克默默点了点头，心里回想着那些盗窃案。他在内部调动的事情上也曾走到过死胡同。每次事件发生时，至少有一名新的调动警员在值班，但从来没有同一名警员重复出现过。弗兰克曾短暂考虑过整个新兵班级有一个广泛的阴谋，但立刻就否定了这个想法。任何能够策划如此大规模背叛的人，应该能够组织出更加微妙的盗窃案，至少是那种不会引起一百英里内每个站点警觉的盗窃。

    to help with the case.”
  id: totrans-50

  zh: “一个叫**Socks**的初级巫师，”弗兰克解释道，“他是名为格雷琴的巫师的学徒。显然，国王请来了几位资深巫师来协助处理此事。”
- en: “I can’t say that I’ve ever heard of Gretchen, but it doesn’t surprise me that
    the king brought the wizards in,” said the captain. “After the attack on the convoy,
    the king has mobilized everyone he can. Even Princess Ann is returning from her
    latest quest. She arrives back at the castle tomorrow.”

- en: That single sentence spoke volumes as to the severity of the situation. Princess
    Ann was almost constantly away leading missions, quests, or critical negotiations.
    For her to return, the situation must be bad.

    then, but Princess Ann is worried that he wasn’t acting alone. That maybe he had
    followers, accomplices, admirers, something like that. She’s been tracking clues
    about this mysterious new league of wizards apparently bent on destroying the

    to recognize everyone. But we’re taking precautions. The royal wizard Marcus created
    magic identification badges for the castle guards. They are almost impossible

- en: Despite this lack of recognition, best-first search was a staple for every police
    officer, ranking up there with other vital tools like a notebook and a pair of
    comfortable shoes. In best-first search, you kept a list of current leads, picked
    the most promising one to follow, and followed it. Once you had followed that
    lead, you simply picked the next best one to follow. Any new clues found along
    the way were added to the list. It was the single best tool to solve many cases.

    Do you know how Notation knew about the ArrayCart?”

    search. This algorithm will be your best tool on the force. You will need it on
    every case. And, of course, it will be on the final.

  zh: 如果你从本课程中只记住一个算法，那应该是最佳优先搜索。这一算法将成为你在执法工作中的得力工具。你将会在每个案件中都需要用到它。当然，它也会出现在期末考试中。
- en: Best-first search is an algorithm that chooses the next state to explore based
    on a score or score function. Each newly discovered search state is given a score
    that corresponds to how good the algorithm believes it to be. For example, you
    might label states by their probability of containing the target value (if you
    can estimate it) or the quality of a lead in an investigation. At each step, the
    algorithm chooses to explore the state with the highest score. You can visualize
    the operation of best-first search as keeping a *sorted* list of states to try
    next.

  zh: 最佳优先搜索是一种根据评分或评分函数选择下一个要探索的状态的算法。每个新发现的搜索状态都会获得一个分数，表示算法认为它有多好。例如，你可以根据状态包含目标值的概率（如果你能估算出来）或调查中的线索质量来标记状态。在每一步中，算法都会选择探索得分最高的状态。你可以将最佳优先搜索的操作可视化为保持一个*排序过的*待试状态列表。
- en: Best-first search can also be used to minimize the costs associated with each
    state, such as the estimated distance of the state to the goal. In this case,
    the algorithm chooses the next state by which one most minimizes the cost.

  zh: 最佳优先搜索也可以用来最小化与每个状态相关的成本，例如状态到目标的估计距离。在这种情况下，算法会选择一个能最大程度减少成本的下一个状态。
- en: Consider a very simple maze where you know the coordinates of the start and
    the goal locations. You can label each state in the search space with a cost equal
    to the distance from that state to the goal. For example, you could use the *Manhattan
    distance*—the total vertical distance to the goal plus the total horizontal distance
    to the goal. This label doesn’t necessarily mean that this state will get you
    there, but it does provide a signal for the search algorithm.

  zh: 考虑一个非常简单的迷宫，你知道起点和终点的位置坐标。你可以为搜索空间中的每个状态标注一个成本，成本等于从该状态到目标的距离。例如，你可以使用*曼哈顿距离*——到目标的总垂直距离加上到目标的总水平距离。这个标签并不一定意味着这个状态能够带你到达目标，但它为搜索算法提供了一个信号。

- en: As the search progresses, it will explore different states (shown as shaded
    circles), find new unexplored states, and add the unexplored states to the list
    of states to try (enclosed in dashed circles). In each iteration, the search selects
    the best unexplored state according to the score or cost. In this example, this
    means selecting the state with the smallest cost.

  zh: 随着搜索的进行，它将探索不同的状态（显示为阴影圆圈），发现新的未探索状态，并将未探索状态加入待试状态列表（用虚线圆圈包围）。在每次迭代中，搜索会根据分数或成本选择最优的未探索状态。在这个例子中，这意味着选择成本最小的状态。

    we only need to explore a little over half the states. For example, we never chose
    to explore the second state of distance 4, because we always had a better option
    to try first.

  zh: 一旦找到终态，我们就可以终止搜索。在这个例子中，我们只需要探索略多于一半的状态。例如，我们从未选择探索距离为4的第二个状态，因为我们总是有更好的选择可以先尝试。

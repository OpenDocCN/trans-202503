    bottleneck and allowed us to significantly expand food production while making
    efficient use of arable land. Yet, to some prognosticators, Haber-Bosch is a sign
    that we strayed from the path. They juxtapose the simple beauty of subsistence
    farming with the complexity—and by implication, the fragility—of chemical engineering
    and modern-day food supply chains. Their prediction is simple: one day, big agriculture

    emergency stash: pasta, rice, beans, flour, cooking oil, vegetable shortening,
    sugar, salt, and most herbs and spices are just some examples of products that
    keep for years in original airtight packaging or in sealed Mylar bags, and that
    can be put to a good use whenever a trip to the grocery store isn’t in the cards.

  zh: 日常烹饪原料可以作为一个称职的“避难”紧急储备的基础：意大利面、米饭、豆类、面粉、食用油、植物起酥油、糖、盐和大多数香料等，这些都是可以在原包装密封或Mylar袋中储存多年，并且在无法去超市时可以派上用场的物品。作为附加好处，糖和米饭是无与伦比的廉价食物来源——每花费一美元就能提供最多3,000千卡的热量。
- en: At first blush, wrapping up the discussion right here would be fair—but then,
    cooking and the associated expenditure of fuel and water adds complexity to your
    plans. This complexity is unwelcome even when bugging in, but imagine hitting
    the road with a bag of flour and an Easy-Bake oven in tow. To avoid such silliness,
    it’s good to explore shelf-stable alternatives that require only minimal preparation
    or are outright ready to eat—for use both in household stashes and as part of
    evacuation kits.

  zh: 从表面看，直接结束讨论似乎是合理的——但实际上，烹饪以及相关的燃料和水的消耗给你的计划带来了更多复杂性。即使在家避难时，这种复杂性也是不受欢迎的，但想象一下，带着一袋面粉和一个简单烤箱上路的情形。为了避免这种荒谬的情况，探索一些只需要最少准备或者完全可以即食的货架稳定食品是一个好主意——这些可以用在家庭储备中，也可以作为疏散包的一部分。
- en: 'Perhaps the most familiar picks in this category are the sugary snacks that
    litter the aisles of every grocery store: energy bars, tea biscuits, and hard
    candy are cheap and calorie-dense, typically providing about 1,500 kcal per pound.
    Along with jams and honey, such sugar-packed goods are a handy option when you
    need a quick jolt. On the flip side, they make for a lousy foundation of a longer-term
    diet, as it’s common to experience discomfort after eating nothing but sugar for
    a day or two. Fat-rich snacks tend to be easier on the stomach and can deliver
    up to 3,000 kcal per pound. On that front, peanut butter and roasted peanuts are
    two excellent picks. As with cooking oil, rancidity is a concern—but if kept in
    sealed containers, both products should stay fresh for a good while.'

  zh: 也许在这一类中最为人熟知的是在每个杂货店的货架上随处可见的含糖零食：能量棒、茶饼干和硬糖便宜且热量密集，通常每磅提供大约1,500 kcal。与果酱和蜂蜜一起，这些富含糖分的食品是需要快速补充能量时的便捷选择。另一方面，它们并不适合作为长期饮食的基础，因为连续吃糖几天后常常会感到不适。富含脂肪的小吃对胃更友好，每磅可提供高达3,000
    kcal。在这方面，花生酱和烤花生是两个非常优秀的选择。和食用油一样，油脂酸败也是一个问题——但如果保持密封，两个产品都应该能够保持较长时间的新鲜。
- en: For more substantial low-hassle meals, canned goods are the go-to choice. The
    high-temperature processing method results in a distinctive texture and some flavor
    changes, so not all products are universally loved—but given the variety available
    on the shelves, almost everybody can find something to like. The relatively low
    cost of canned goods makes them a reasonable foundation of a bug-in stash. Unfortunately,
    the low-calorie density of fruit, veggies, and most soups—about 350 kcal/lb—also
    makes them inefficient on the go. Meats, such as SPAM or sardines in oil, fare
    better and provide around 1,000 kcal per pound.

    kcal per pound. Australian Bega cheese, resembling any number of generic processed
    cheese products, has about half as many calories. A little-known gem comes from

- en: 'The next option of note is *freeze-dried meals*: fairly expensive products
    that, owing to their unique processing method, manage to near flawlessly preserve
    the taste and texture of meats, fruit, and vegetables, while keeping fresh for
    20 to 30 years or more. All that’s needed to reconstitute the meal is a cup or
    two of hot water and a brief wait. Not every freeze-dried entree hits the mark—for
    example, eggs don’t feel quite right—but many could pass for restaurant made.
    Plenty of manufacturers are out there, but it’s probably best to stick to the
    most reputable and best-liked duo: the Mountain House brand (produced in Oregon
    by OFD Foods) and the Utah-based Augason Farms.'

  zh: 另一个值得注意的选择是*冻干餐*：这些价格相对较高的产品，凭借其独特的加工方式，几乎能够完美保留肉类、水果和蔬菜的味道和质地，并且可以保持新鲜20到30年甚至更久。重建餐点所需的唯一条件是几杯热水和稍等片刻。并非每一道冻干主菜都能做到完美——例如，鸡蛋的口感就不太对劲——但许多产品的质量堪比餐厅制作的。市面上有很多制造商，但最好还是选择最有信誉且口碑最好的两大品牌：位于俄勒冈州的Mountain

- en: The final contender are *MREs*, short for *meals ready to eat*. Packed in plastic
    pouches and processed using a method similar to canning, the entrees usually include
    chunks of meat or pasta in thick sauce as the main dish, and then crackers, applesauce,
    or pudding on the side; a chemical heater is typically provided too. MREs are
    popular with militaries around the world because of the solid, if uninspiring,
    balance of relatively long shelf life and convenience in the field. That said,
    they offer neither the flavor of freeze-dried meals nor the energy density of
    some of the simpler and cheaper choices discussed earlier—and as such, are strictly
    a matter of taste.

    three for a year requires about 2,200,000 calories. The humble potato, one of
    the most calorie-dense crops that can be cultivated and harvested with ease, packs
    about 160 kcal and weighs 7.5 ounces on average; it follows that about three tons
    of potatoes would need to be harvested each year to meet the family’s needs. Supplanting
    even just 20 percent of total calorie intake from a backyard potato patch would
    be a rather extraordinary feat.

    take stock of any requirements or restrictions. Evaluation *requirements* could
    come from external regulatory bodies (such as a state insurance commission) or
    be contractual (such as an agreement with a vendor or outside party). An organization’s
    cyber insurance carrier, for example, may state that in order to maintain coverage
    or see a favorable premium, the organization must conduct a tabletop exercise
    on an annual basis and document it with a report containing the scenario outline,
    attendees, and key recommendations. Alternatively, the organization’s risk management
    team may require that the development team create a report with identified recommendations,
    named stakeholders, and parties responsible for addressing any shortcomings.

  zh: 在规划具体的评估活动之前，开发团队应对任何要求或限制进行盘点。评估*要求*可能来自外部监管机构（例如州保险委员会）或是合同性要求（例如与供应商或外部方的协议）。例如，组织的网络保险承保方可能会要求，为了维持保险覆盖或获得优惠的保费，组织必须每年进行一次桌面演练，并通过报告记录该演练，报告内容应包括场景大纲、参与者以及关键建议。或者，组织的风险管理团队可能要求开发团队创建一份报告，列出已识别的建议、相关利益方及负责解决任何问题的方。
- en: The development team also needs to be aware of any legal *restrictions* imposed
    on the evaluation process. For example, the legal team may express reservations
    about putting certain information in writing. If sensitive data were stolen during
    a cybersecurity incident and there was a written document citing a high likelihood
    of this data being stolen, it could create a legal risk. For this reason (among
    others), the development team should confer with the organization’s legal resources
    to understand any requirements or restrictions prior to creating any documentation.

- en: For the first stage of the debrief, allot approximately 15 minutes at the end
    of the tabletop exercise for an open discussion about the recommendations discussed
    in the tabletop exercise. If the attendees are tired and not contributing, the
    evaluator can recap some of the issues that emerged, then ask them to confirm
    that those issues are indeed valid. This serves as a way to check that the evaluator’s
    initial observations are apt before they make their way into a report.
  id: totrans-27

  zh: 在汇报的第一阶段，为桌面演练结束时留出大约15分钟的时间，进行关于演练中讨论的建议的开放讨论。如果与会者感到疲倦并且没有积极发言，评估者可以回顾演练中出现的一些问题，然后要求他们确认这些问题是否确实有效。这是检查评估者最初观察是否合适的一种方式，确保其能够进入报告中。
- en: The second stage—in which the facilitator meets with the executive sponsor,
    high-ranking attendees, and other prominent participants—is an opportunity to
    gather additional feedback from a smaller and more select group of participants.
    This is especially important for external facilitators, as it offers a more intimate

- en: In both stages, the facilitator has an opportunity to advocate for the interests
    of the participants. For example, if a discussion point revealed that the organization
    doesn’t maintain key logs longer than 10 days and an attendee has continually
    advocated for funds to increase log retention, the facilitator can reinforce this
    recommendation in the final report. Alternatively, staff members may have repeatedly
    stated that they lacked training to better respond to cybersecurity events, in
    which case the facilitator can advocate for more training.

    Often, recommendations will emerge during the tabletop exercise itself as the
    attendees brainstorm ways to alleviate a shortcoming. It most likely isn’t the

- en: A recommendation does not need to solve every element of an issue. For example,
    it doesn’t need to factor in budget considerations, technical limitations, or
    in-depth exploration of other issues; these are for another day. It does, however,
    need to be realistic. Where possible, the recommendation should also be grounded

  zh: 聚焦于网络安全问题的桌面演练无疑与组织的事件响应计划密切相关，这也是更新该计划的最佳时机。利用桌面演练报告，相关方应当会面讨论计划的适用性。
- en: Prior to the tabletop exercise, the development team should identify the specific
    individual responsible for maintaining the incident response plan. While standards
    state that an incident response plan should have an owner, unfortunately it’s
    not uncommon for the plan’s defined owner to be “information security” or “risk
    management,” which diffuses responsibility. The development team can work with
    the plan owner while developing the scenario and invite them to be a passive participant
    in the exercise if they already don’t have a role.

  zh: 在桌面演练之前，开发团队应当确定具体的负责人来维护事件响应计划。虽然标准规定事件响应计划应当有一个负责人，但不幸的是，计划的负责人常常被定义为“信息安全”或“风险管理”，这会稀释责任。开发团队可以在制定场景时与计划负责人合作，如果负责人还没有参与角色，也可以邀请其作为被动参与者参与演练。
- en: Ideally, the organization’s incident response plan has a predefined update interval
    period, such as twice a year, with out-of-cycle updates occurring as needed. The
    findings from the tabletop may be incorporated into the next review process; if
    the next update interval is several months in the future or if a critical item
    emerged, an ad hoc update might be appropriate.

- en: Updates to the incident response plan aren’t always arduous. Tabletop exercises
    might uncover several small weaknesses, such as a contact list that doesn’t include
    phone numbers for a key vendor or a lack of clear responsibilities. Many of these
    are quick fixes. If a significant item emerges, however, such as uncertainty over
    whether the incident response team can shut down a revenue-generating application,
    it’s possible the update will require input from several stakeholders.

- en: If the organization has defined a formal tabletop exercise program, it should
    be able to perform an exercise with a few days’ notice, if needed. This is extremely
    beneficial given that the cybersecurity threat landscape can change in a matter
    of hours or days due to geopolitical events, new technical exploits, or recently
    passed legislation. Organizations are regularly playing catch-up when responding
    to these landscape changes, and a tabletop exercise is one method of assessing
    its preparation in the face of a new threat. While details during a major event
    may be scarce, a snap tabletop exercise can gather key stakeholders to discuss
    the impact based on what is known and convey to leadership that the situation
    is getting due consideration.

  zh: 如果组织已经定义了正式的桌面演练计划，它应该能够在几天的通知内进行演练（如果需要的话）。考虑到网络安全威胁态势可能因地缘政治事件、新的技术漏洞或最近通过的立法而在几小时或几天内发生变化，这一点尤为重要。组织在应对这些威胁态势变化时通常处于追赶状态，而桌面演练则是评估在面对新威胁时准备情况的一种方法。尽管在重大事件期间细节可能匮乏，但快速的桌面演练可以召集关键利益相关者，基于已知信息讨论事件的影响，并向领导层传达情况正在得到应有的重视。
- en: Finally, a formalized tabletop exercise program conveys to external stakeholders
    that preparing for cybersecurity incidents is an important part of its information
    security posture. Increasingly, external stakeholders assess the cybersecurity
    risk of entering into a business relationship. For example, a cyber insurance
    underwriter will ask questions to gauge cybersecurity risk and determine the most
    appropriate insurance premium. By presenting a documented tabletop exercise program
    to interested parties, the organization proves it is taking cybersecurity seriously
    and making efforts to reduce risk.

    for a cybersecurity incident is important to the organization. Selectively sharing
    a few identified shortcomings and the actions taken to remediate them will also
    demonstrate that the organization is making improvements as a result of the tabletop

    7 out of 10 exercises mention that participants were confused about their responsibilities
    during a cybersecurity incident; this trend may point to a systemic issue that
    needs to be addressed. Because it’s easy to focus on a singular report after a

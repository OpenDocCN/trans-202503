    Since the captain had gone so far as to hire Frank in person, he hadn’t expected
    to run into any officers. If the captain didn’t trust his officers, either they
    were under suspicion—so he’d shuffle them to some case far across the city—or
    they simply weren’t good enough. But, from the looks of it, someone was on the
    case and Frank was already behind.

- en: A computer is made up of countless components, crafted by many discrete craftsmen.
    I’m pretty sure I’m not a computer, yet I too feel composed of unique individuals
    and communities. Even though there is a single name on the cover of this book,
    you would not be holding it in your hands today without them.

  zh: 计算机由无数部件组成，由许多离散的工匠精心制作。我很确定我不是一台计算机，但我也觉得自己由独特的个体和社群组成。尽管这本书封面上只有一个名字，但没有他们，你今天就不会拿着它。
- en: First and foremost, I want to acknowledge my parents, who expertly navigated
    the complexities of raising a child, deftly sublimating my rebellious tendencies
    into a creative and independent love of learning that has benefited me ever since.

  zh: 首先，我要感谢我的父母，他们精通如何应对养育子女的复杂性，巧妙地将我的叛逆倾向转化为对学习的创造性热爱和独立性，这种影响至今仍然受益。
- en: Similarly, I am forever grateful to my older brother Keelian, who always equally
    challenged and inspired me. Nothing like a never-ending sibling rivalry to bring
    out the best in us . . . right?

  zh: 类似地，我永远感激我的哥哥Keelian，他总是同时挑战和激励着我。没有什么比永不休止的兄弟姐妹之争更能激发我们的潜力了……对吧？
- en: I also want to thank my many coworkers and colleagues at the NSA and in the
    larger the infosec community, whose guidance and support have been invaluable
    over the years. Though there are far too many to name in this short section, a
    few, namely my close friends and colleagues Kasey, Tom, Josh, and Jon, have had
    a profoundly positive influence on both my personal life and career. Others, such
    as the brilliant Jonathan Levin and Arnaud Abbati, have always selflessly provided
    indispensable technical insights and mentorship, giving me both the confidence
    and expertise to write this book. I am lucky to count both as close friends.

  zh: 我还要感谢我在NSA及更大的信息安全社区中的许多同事和同行多年来的指导和支持。虽然在这个简短的章节中无法一一列出，但是其中几位，特别是我亲近的朋友和同事Kasey、Tom、Josh和Jon，对我个人生活和职业都产生了深远的正面影响。其他人，如杰出的Jonathan
    Levin和Arnaud Abbati，总是无私地提供不可或缺的技术见解和指导，使我既有信心又有专业知识来写这本书。能够把他们都视为亲密的朋友，我感到很幸运。

- en: Last, but certainly not the least, are the many individuals who worked directly
    on the book. These delightful (and, yes, sometimes strict) humans kept me roughly
    on schedule to bring this book to fruition. First, a big mahalo to Runa Sandvik
    for her invaluable input and editing skills on the initial draft of this book.
    Also, my good friend Tom McGuire (Tmac), who put countless hours into the rather
    thankless job of technical editor. Finally, a big thank you to the incredibly
    professional and hardworking crew at No Starch Press, including founder Bill Pollock
    and the book’s main editor, Frances Saux.

  zh: 最后，但绝非不重要的是直接参与这本书创作的许多人。这些令人愉快（有时候也严格）的人类确保我大致按计划完成了这本书。首先，要感谢Runa Sandvik在书稿初稿上的宝贵意见和编辑技能。还要感谢我的好朋友Tom
    McGuire（Tmac），他为技术编辑这个有点苦不堪言的工作投入了无数个小时。最后，要衷心感谢No Starch Press的非常专业和勤奋的团队，包括创始人Bill
    Pollock和这本书的主编Frances Saux。

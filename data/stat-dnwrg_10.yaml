- en: I’ve talked about the common mistakes made by scientists and how the best way
    to spot them is with a bit of outside scrutiny. Peer reviewers provide some of
    this scrutiny, but they don’t have time to extensively reanalyze data and read
    code for typos—they can check only that the methodology makes sense. Sometimes
    they spot obvious errors, but subtle problems are usually missed.^([1](apa.html#ch11en1))

  zh: 我曾谈到过科学家常犯的错误，以及发现这些错误的最佳方式是进行一些外部审查。同行评审提供了部分审查，但他们没有时间对数据进行广泛的重新分析或检查代码中的拼写错误——他们只能检查方法是否合理。有时他们会发现明显的错误，但微妙的问题通常被忽略。^([1](apa.html#ch11en1))
- en: This is one reason why many journals and professional societies require researchers
    to make their data available to other scientists upon request. Full datasets are
    usually too large to print in the pages of a journal, and online publication of
    results is rare—full data is available online for less than 10% of papers published
    by top journals, with partial publication of select results more common.^([2](apa.html#ch11en2))
    Instead, authors report their results and send the complete data to other scientists
    only if they ask for a copy. Perhaps they will find an error or a pattern the
    original scientists missed, or perhaps they can use the data to investigate a
    related topic. Or so it goes in theory.

    to analyze every recent article in several prominent journals of the American
    Psychological Association (APA) to learn about their statistical methods. They
    chose the APA partly because it requires authors to agree to share their data
    with other psychologists seeking to verify their claims. But six months later,
    they had received data for only 64 of the 249 studies they sought it for. Almost
    three-quarters of authors never sent their data.^([3](apa.html#ch11en3))

  zh: 2005 年，Jelte Wicherts 和阿姆斯特丹大学的同事决定分析几本美国心理学会（APA）主要期刊上所有近期的文章，以了解它们的统计方法。他们选择
    APA 部分原因是因为该期刊要求作者同意与其他心理学家共享数据，以便验证他们的论点。但六个月后，他们仅从 249 项研究中收到了 64 项研究的数据。几乎四分之三的作者从未提供他们的数据。^([3](apa.html#ch11en3))
- en: Of course, scientists are busy people. Perhaps they simply didn’t have time
    to compile their datasets, produce documents describing what each variable meant
    and how it was measured, and so on. Or perhaps their motive was self-preservation;
    perhaps their data was not as conclusive as they claimed. Wicherts and his colleagues
    decided to test this. They trawled through all the studies, looking for common
    errors that could be spotted by reading the paper, such as inconsistent statistical
    results, misuse of statistical tests, and ordinary typos. At least half of the
    papers had an error, usually minor, but 15% reported at least one statistically
    significant result that was significant only because of an error.

  zh: 当然，科学家们都是忙碌的人。也许他们根本没有时间整理他们的数据集，制作描述每个变量含义及其测量方法的文档，等等。或者他们的动机是自我保护；也许他们的数据并不像他们所声称的那样具有决定性。Wicherts
    和他的同事决定进行测试。他们深入查阅了所有的研究，寻找可以通过阅读论文发现的常见错误，如统计结果不一致、统计测试使用不当和普通的拼写错误。至少一半的论文存在错误，通常是些小错误，但有
    15% 的论文报告了至少一个统计学上显著的结果，这个结果之所以显著，仅仅是因为出现了错误。
- en: Next Wicherts and his colleagues looked for a correlation between these errors
    and an unwillingness to share data. There was a clear relationship. Authors who
    refused to share their data were more likely to have committed an error in their
    paper, and their statistical evidence tended to be weaker.^([4](apa.html#ch11en4))

    statistical errors, and many more may be lurking.

    由于大多数作者拒绝分享数据，Wicherts 无法深入挖掘更深层次的统计错误，可能还隐藏着更多问题。
- en: This is certainly not proof that authors hid their data because they knew their
    results were flawed or weak; there are many possible confounding factors. Correlation
    doesn’t imply causation, but it does waggle its eyebrows suggestively and gesture
    furtively while mouthing, “Look over there.”^([[19](#ftn.ch11fn01a)]) And the
    surprisingly high error rates demonstrate why data should be shared. Many errors
    are not obvious in the published paper and will be noticed only when someone reanalyzes
    the original data from scratch.

    have no incentive to maintain a carefully organized personal archive of datasets,

    One study of 516 articles published between 1991 and 2011 found that the probability

- en: ^([[21](#ch11fn03a)]) The Cochrane Collaboration logo is a chart depicting the
    results of studies on corticosteroids given to women entering labor prematurely.
    The studies on their own were statistically insignificant, but when the data was
    aggregated, it was clear the treatment would save lives. This remained undiscovered
    for years because nobody did a comprehensive review to combine available data.

- en: ^([[22](#ch11fn04a)]) I am told that even with the right materials, biological
    experiments can be fiendishly difficult to reproduce because they are sensitive
    to tiny variations in experimental setup. But that’s not an excuse—it’s a serious
    problem. How can we treat a result as general when it worked only once?

  zh: ^([[22](#ch11fn04a)]) 我听说即使使用正确的材料，生物实验也可能难以重复，因为它们对实验设置中的微小变化非常敏感。但这不是借口——这是一个严肃的问题。当一个结果只成功过一次时，我们如何将其视为普遍有效的呢？
- en: ^([[23](#ch11fn05a)]) Note that this would not work if each study were truly
    measuring a different effect because of some systematic differences in how the
    studies were conducted. Estimating their true power would be much more difficult
    in that case.

  zh: ^([[23](#ch11fn05a)]) 请注意，如果每项研究的效果测量确实不同，因为研究方法中存在某些系统性差异，这种方法将不起作用。在这种情况下，估算它们的真实效能将更加困难。

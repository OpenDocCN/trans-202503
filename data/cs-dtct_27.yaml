    spells, but no dampening spells. Marcus does too much work there for the king.”

    protective spells that will block offensive magic. King Fredrick also employs
    a half-dozen wizard guards. They’re junior, but they can undo a basic curse. And
    then there is Marcus. Few wizards would want to cross him.”

  zh: “可以，”卢普博士回答，“但那可不明智。城堡有十几道保护咒语可以阻挡攻击性魔法。弗雷德里克国王还雇佣了六名巫师守卫。虽然他们级别较低，但足以解开基础的诅咒。还有马库斯。没有多少巫师愿意与他为敌。”

  zh: “那神器呢？”
- en: “Ah. Now that’s a good question. It depends on the artifact. The castle has
    protection against weaponized artifacts, of course, but nothing can protect against
    all artifacts. There are simply too many varieties. Since most artifacts don’t
    require new magic (having been previously enchanted), not even the spell-blocking
    spells in the prison could help there.”
  id: totrans-28

  zh: “啊，这个问题问得好。它取决于神器。城堡当然有防御武器化神器的保护，但没有任何东西能防得了所有神器。神器种类实在太多了。由于大多数神器不需要新的魔法（因为之前已经被施过魔法），连监狱里的防魔法咒语也无法起作用。”
- en: “What?” asked Frank. “I thought the prison was immune to all magic. Don’t they
    keep evil wizards there? In fact, isn’t Exponentious there? He tried to destroy
    the entire kingdom with magic. Why don’t they just block all magical artifacts
    from working?”
  id: totrans-29

- en: Dr. Loop gave a dry laugh. “Sorry to disappoint you, but you can’t block all
    the artifacts. Don’t worry, though; the royal wizards keep the most powerful ones
    well guarded. And all prisoners are thoroughly searched when they arrive.”

    the array values, intruders have to rely on exhaustive search. And, since the
    cells are shuffled daily, you can’t break up the search over several nights. The
    guards complain that the randomness is just annoying. They spend hours each day
    taking roll call. Although I heard that they’ve recently made a game around it

    good would the spell be if you could break into the capital police station’s record
    room and steal the cell assignments? The goal is to make intruders spend hours
    searching through the prison, which would clearly be impossible. All the guards

- en: Frank saw the final piece fall into place. The captain had said that the League
    of Unnecessary Complexity were followers or accomplices of that evil wizard Exponentious—the
    most dangerous criminal in the royal prison. Everyone was worried that the league
    was planning to strike again, maybe even to attack the castle. But the plan was
    so much simpler than that. The league was planning a prison break; they were going

    the problem has, the more potential you have to utilize this information. As you’ve

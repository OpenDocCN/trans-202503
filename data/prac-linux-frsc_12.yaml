- en: In theory, an exhaustive forensic examination of a Linux system would include
    understanding the origin, purpose, and contents of every file and directory on
    the entire system. This is typically hundreds of thousands of files.^([1](footnotes.xhtml#afoot_01))
    Clearly not all of these files are of forensic interest. Documenting every possible
    file and directory from a forensics perspective is infeasible. There are too many
    fringe use cases, and each distro and system administrator introduces their own
    files and applications. In addition, the free and open source landscape is in
    a state of perpetual change. New files are introduced and legacy files are deprecated.

  zh: 从理论上讲，对 Linux 系统的彻底法医检查应包括理解整个系统中每个文件和目录的来源、目的和内容。这通常涉及数十万个文件。^([1](footnotes.xhtml#afoot_01))
    显然，并非所有这些文件都对法医调查有价值。从法医角度记录每一个可能的文件和目录是不可行的。由于存在大量的边缘使用案例，每个发行版和系统管理员也会引入他们自己的文件和应用程序。此外，自由和开源软件领域处于持续变化的状态中。新文件被引入，旧文件则被弃用。
- en: In this book, I have covered the analysis of a small number of these files and
    directories, but the coverage is far from complete. I made explicit decisions
    to include topics that cover the most frequent use cases a forensic examiner may
    encounter.

- en: When faced with an unknown file or directory, you can ask several questions
    to determine why it is there and how it got there. Where did the file come from?
    Is the file part of an installed software package? If not, does the ownership
    reveal who created it? Does the location of the file on the filesystem (its directory)
    give any indication of how or why it was created? What do you know about the owner
    and group of the file? Does the filename appear in any logs or configuration files?
    The timestamps show when the file was created, last modified/changed, and last
    accessed. Do these timestamps correlate with any activity in the logs? Were any
    other files created or deleted around this same time? Is the filename recorded
    in the shell history as part of a command typed by a user? What kind of file is
    it? Does the filename appear in any unallocated areas of the drive? Does an examination
    of the file contents reveal anything about the file’s origin or purpose? Asking
    and attempting to answer these questions will help an investigator understand
    the origin and purpose of files and directories on a Linux system.

  zh: 当面对一个未知的文件或目录时，可以提出几个问题来确定它的存在原因和来源。这个文件来自哪里？该文件是某个安装软件包的一部分吗？如果不是，文件的所有权是否能揭示是谁创建的？文件在文件系统中的位置（它的目录）是否能为它的创建方式或原因提供任何线索？你对文件的所有者和所属组了解多少？该文件名是否出现在任何日志或配置文件中？时间戳显示文件的创建时间、最后修改/更改时间和最后访问时间。这些时间戳是否与日志中的任何活动相关联？在这段时间内，是否有其他文件被创建或删除？该文件名是否在用户输入的命令中出现在
    shell 历史记录中？它是什么类型的文件？文件名是否出现在硬盘的任何未分配区域？检查文件内容是否能揭示文件的来源或目的？提出并尝试回答这些问题将帮助调查人员理解
    Linux 系统中文件和目录的来源和目的。
- en: Be cautious when researching the internet for information about a particular
    file or directory. Look for authoritative sources of information. If it is a software
    package or a certain application file type, find the project team’s website and
    look at their official documentation. Ultimately, the most authoritative information
    is the source code (especially if the documentation is out of date). If there
    are discrepancies between the source code and any documentation, the source code
    (with the matching version used) takes priority.

  zh: 在互联网上查找有关特定文件或目录的信息时要小心。寻找权威的信息来源。如果它是某个软件包或特定应用程序文件类型，找到该项目团队的网站并查看他们的官方文档。最终，最权威的信息是源代码（尤其是当文档已过时时）。如果源代码和任何文档之间存在不一致，源代码（及其使用的匹配版本）优先。
- en: Peer-reviewed academic literature is another authoritative source of information.
    In the forensics community, papers published in peer reviewed academic journals
    like Forensic Science International’s *Digital Investigation* or at research conferences
    like DFRWS take an approach to analysis that has undergone scrutiny from other
    professionals in the field. These are only two examples of academic and practitioner
    literature (I’ve mentioned them because I am involved in both). There are other
    reputable digital forensics periodicals and conferences like the IEEE Transactions
    on Information Forensics and Security and the annual conference of the Association
    of Digital Forensics Security and Law (ADFSL).

  zh: 同行评审的学术文献是另一种权威的信息来源。在法医界，像《法医学国际》的*数字调查*，或者像DFRWS这样的研究会议上发表的论文，采取了一种经由领域内其他专业人士审查的分析方法。这仅仅是学术和实践文献的两个例子（我提到它们是因为我参与其中）。还有其他信誉良好的数字取证期刊和会议，比如IEEE《信息取证与安全学报》和数字取证安全与法学会（ADFSL）年会。
- en: Maintain a healthy skepticism of blogs, forums, commercial sites, and search-engine-optimized
    web content for a given topic. Many blog posts, forum discussions, YouTube videos,
    and company white papers are excellent, accurate, and helpful; however, many are
    not. Following false or incorrect sources of information can have significant
    negative consequences in forensics. Criminals may never face justice, or worse,
    innocent people may be falsely implicated.

- en: Many new forensics books focus on application analysis, cloud forensics, mobile
    forensics, big data analytics, and other new and popular areas. Topics such as
    operating system analysis might seem old and less exciting by comparison. But
    significant advancements to Linux have been made in the past decade, and digital
    forensics literature has not kept up. With this book, I have tried to fill that
    gap.

- en: The Linux world is changing all the time and new features are added to the kernel
    on a regular basis. Follow the Linux kernel mailing list (LKML) for evidence of
    this! The adoption and continued development of systemd will change how we analyze
    userspace. Systemd is the new “system layer” between the kernel and users’ running
    applications. Also significant is the transition from X11 to Wayland together
    with the trend to abandon the traditional desktop metaphor. Discovering and understanding
    all the available forensic artifacts on a Linux system will continue to be a challenge.

- en: This book has highlighted many areas that are beneficial to forensic investigators,
    and at the same time revealed areas that may pose privacy risks to users. Undoubtedly,
    many of the privacy issues will eventually be fixed and cease to provide traces
    of evidence. This is the natural evolution of digital forensics and is ultimately
    good for society. But don’t worry, new opportunities for gathering evidence are
    springing into existence just as fast as legacy sources are disappearing. A good
    forensic investigator always keeps on top of new developments in the field.

- en: This book has completely avoided the topic of live system analysis and Linux
    memory analysis. I intentionally focused on postmortem analysis. There are enough
    excellent books on incident response that cover live analysis of running Linux
    systems, but very few take a “dead disk” analysis approach, which is crucial for
    the forensically sound investigation of severe criminal incidents. Covering only
    the analysis of postmortem forensic images has allowed far greater focus and depth,
    resulting in a more useful reference book. Attempting to cover both live and postmortem
    scenarios in a similarly sized manuscript would have diluted the content.

  zh: 本书完全避免了实时系统分析和Linux内存分析的话题。我故意将重点放在了事后分析上。市面上有很多关于事件响应的优秀书籍，涵盖了运行中的Linux系统的实时分析，但很少有书籍采用“死磁盘”分析方法，而这种方法对于对严重犯罪事件进行具有法医效力的调查至关重要。只涉及事后法医镜像分析，使得本书能够集中精力并深入探讨，最终成为一本更有用的参考书。如果试图在类似篇幅的手稿中同时涵盖实时和事后场景，内容势必会被稀释。

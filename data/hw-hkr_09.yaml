- en: One of my earliest open hardware projects was chumby, the Wi-Fi-enabled content
    delivery device that took me to China to set up my first supply chain in 2007.[*](footnote.xhtml#fn17)
    Working on chumby was personally exciting to me for two reasons. First, I had
    the opportunity to build a product that could improve people’s lives in some small
    way. The always-on, always-connected users who blog and rely on IM to keep in
    touch could use chumby to make those connections more easily. At the same time,
    chumby was a chance for me to create a truly open platform that enabled hackers
    to tinker and modify it however they liked.

    从事chumby项目让我个人感到兴奋有两个原因。首先，我有机会构建一款能够以某种方式改善人们生活的产品。对于那些依赖IM保持联系、随时在线、随时连接的用户来说，chumby能够帮助他们更轻松地进行这些连接。同时，chumby也是我创造一个真正开放平台的机会，它让黑客能够随心所欲地改动和修改设备。

    products to discover unintended functionality. At Chumby, we hoped hackers would
    learn how the device worked and transform it to do things we never imagined, so
    we designed chumby to be as open as possible to *anybody* who wanted to hack it.
    We considered not only open source software hackers, but also hardware hackers,
    artists, and crafters—that is, people skilled with and passionate about noncomputer
    things, like metalworking, sewing, or carpentry. To encourage and enable chumby
    hackers, we made the source code, schematics, board layouts, bill of materials,
    flat patterns, and 3D CAD databases of the plastic pieces freely available. You

    hardware and into hacks they could share with just about anyone. For instance,
    imagine you add a blood pressure cuff to a chumby and give the chumby to your
    grandmother. Now you can check on Grandma’s health, and she can watch pictures
    of her grandchildren while she gets her blood pressure taken. But imagine this
    scenario with a WRT-54G router instead of a chumby. Sure, you can add a blood
    pressure cuff to a WRT-54G as well (in fact, it’s quite similar to chumby architecturally),
    but try teaching Grandma how to set it up and use it. In other words, we felt
    making chumby a simple product would allow hackers to make their own hacks more
    usable and more understandable to the less technical people in their lives.

    your thermostat is a little too far from the place where you actually want to
    regulate temperature. You could solve that problem in a weekend by adding a temperature
    sensor to a chumby. The chumby platform has Wi-Fi and I built a hacker sensor
    package for the device, so the project would require minimal hardware grunge work:
    you’d just mod two chumbys (one with a temperature sensor and one with an interface
    to the thermostat) and enable both with the sensor package. Such a device would

    chip, which was cost-effective but made development quite complicated. Developers
    were exposed directly to all the warts of NAND flash memory, including bad blocks

    replace the microSD card from the outside. We made that choice to prevent nonhackers
    from pulling the microSD card out and wondering why the device wouldn’t boot.
    But if you unscrew and remove the back panel (no glue seals, unlike the chumby
    classic), the microSD card is easy to access. Thanks to this key change, hackers
    didn’t have to worry about bricking their chumbys. If someone screwed up the firmware,

    so that we could directly drop ext3 (a popular default Linux filesystem configuration)
    onto it. The root partition was still mounted as read-only at the factory to prevent
    accidental damage, but a managed NAND system made remounting the root partition
    as read/write and modifying the Linux system trivial. We consciously made the
    OS image use only a small portion of the total microSD card capacity, leaving
    hackers with over a gigabyte of extra space to load custom applications and libraries.

- en: In hardware, what’s good for hackers is also good for developers. The flexibility
    we added for hackers allowed us to add a ton of great features to the OS. For
    example, the chumby One supported certain 3G modems and could serve Wi-Fi as an
    access point through those 3G modems. That basically made the device a 3G-to-Wi-Fi
    router, which I found enormously useful when I was traveling and needed to create
    a Wi-Fi hotspot for other devices. We didn’t expose that feature at the mainstream
    user level at first, but we knew we (or anyone else—it was an open project, after
    all) could wrap a GUI around it and make it more user-friendly if people liked
    it. And if you plugged a USB keyboard into a chumby One, it would automatically
    open a console shell that you could type into. That’s handy for times when you
    can’t SSH in, like when you’re debugging network scripts.

    is that you have a totally unconstrained set of tools to solve the problems at
    hand. You can solve business problems with board layout, and vice versa. For example,
    there was a question about how we could uniquely and flexibly brand units, in
    a fashion that allowed for swappable faceplates (that is, snap on the NFL faceplate
    and get your football scores, snap on the Bloomberg faceplate and get your financial
    news, and so on). This is a topic that could take dozens of meetings to hash out.
    But as the sole hardware guy, I knew that embedding an EEPROM costs only $0.20
    and while everyone else discussed possible solutions in the staff meeting, I fired
    up my board design tool, added the eight-pin EEPROM to the board, tossed on an
    appropriate connector, and had the whole solution engineered by the time action
    items were assigned. It actually took me longer to convince them that the work
    was done than it took to do the work.'

    The question was always whether it would be faster for me to do it myself or to
    explain it to someone else, wait for them to do it, and possibly have to re-explain
    it and have them change it. That’s one reason I learned mechanical design; the
    industrial design and plastics tooling is a long pole in the tent for many consumer
    products, and being able to efficiently and effectively communicate with a mechanical
    engineering team using their language was important to getting the job done right.

- en: '**Dealing with the merchant buyers.**  Brick-and-mortar retailers hire teams
    of buyers assigned to monetize shelf space. They think about products in terms
    of revenue per shelf space, and they don’t really see anything beyond that. This
    puts into sharp relief any improvements you want to add to the product that also
    drive up product costs. Merchants tend to look at your product as so many grams
    of plastic and so many wires. They multiply those numbers by the commodity price
    of the raw materials to set expectations for how much they’ll pay to have it on
    the shelf. It’s possible to cut better deals, but educating a merchant about the
    value of your product takes a lot of effort. Unfortunately, the turnover in merchant
    staff can be fairly high, so you may spend months cutting a deal only to find
    that the person you were working with has left the organization.'

- en: '**Margin.**  Everyone in the supply chain has a hand out: the distributor,
    the merchant, and the factory. Beyond that, market development funds and other
    slush money have to be factored in. At the end of the day, the shelf cost of a
    product is about three times your BOM cost. This means adding a $0.50 part turns
    into a $1.50 retail price impact.'

- en: This is aggravated by the fact that prices are quantized into “magic” numbers
    (like $19.99, $49.99, or $99.99) that you have to hit. You just don’t MSRP a product
    for $127.45\. If a product retails for above $99, it’s psychologically binned
    with the $149 or $199 products. When your product’s BOM cost approaches one of
    these quantization points, you’ll do lots of soul searching about whether it’s
    worth $0.50 to improve, say, the speakers. Either that small cost increase will
    come out of your own margin, or you risk pushing your product into a higher price
    tier.

  zh: 这种情况因为价格被量化为“魔法”数字（如$19.99、$49.99或$99.99）而变得更加复杂，你必须瞄准这些价格区间。你不可能把一款产品定价为$127.45。如果产品的零售价格超过$99，它就会在心理上与$149或$199的产品归为同一类别。当你的产品BOM成本接近这些量化点时，你将会进行许多深思熟虑的权衡，考虑是否值得花$0.50去提升，比如改进扬声器。要么这一小笔成本将来自你自己的利润，要么你就有可能把产品推向更高的价格区间。
- en: '**Cash flow.** Retailers are notoriously bad at paying on time. You may negotiate
    60-day terms, but often you’re not paid after 90 or even 120 days. If your product
    doesn’t sell out so that the retailer has to place another order with you (at
    which point you have some leverage to collect outstanding payment), you’ll get
    strung out. This can be partially mitigated with financial instruments such as
    factoring insurance. Insurance companies will sell insurance on anything, including

    return guarantees. That’s great for the customer, but guess who services those
    returns? The retailer passes the buck back to the entrepreneur! This is part of
    why payment times can be quite bad: retailers are retaining cash to hand back
    to customers to satisfy returns. Once the returns are processed, you get to figure
    out how to get the returned material off their dock and back into a facility where
    you can refurbish the units. Typically, most returned units aren’t defective.
    They simply didn’t meet customer expectations, or the customer had buyer’s remorse

    very strongly favor them in almost every contingency. Sometimes, the contracts

    which stated that derivatives going to mass production had to get additional authorization
    from Chumby. We added that primarily to create a checkpoint to verify interoperability
    with the servers, and also to enforce proper trademark and branding rules. Burying
    that clause in the license meant that the license couldn’t be called open source
    because Chumby could always say no, though it never did in practice. However,
    the situation does highlight an ongoing struggle in open source hardware: how

- en: Also, the rights to the patents I created at Chumby are all assigned to the
    investors. They will likely be sold to the highest bidder, which could very well
    be a patent troll. I would regard that outcome as unfortunate, but it’s a reality
    that I must accept. The investors have the right to explore all lawful venues
    to recover their investment. In an ideal world, however, I’d buy back the rights

    and then scrap all but one so they can evaluate multiple design approaches. For
    Apple, tossing $200,000 in tooling to save two months’ time to market is peanuts.
    But for a startup that raised a million bucks, that’s unthinkable. Apple also

    two to three years to push a major platform revision, at which point that revision
    was already obsolete. My PhD dissertation[*](footnote.xhtml#fn19) was centered
    on Moore’s law and its impact on computer architecture. The most powerful computers
    are descendants of a processor designed in the 1970s (the Intel 8085) with derivatives
    still used today as the brains of toaster oven. Why? Because running existing
    code on backward-compatible CPUs has almost always been faster than porting old
    code to a new microarchitecture. Given that fact, in my thesis, I designed a microarchitecture
    that nobody could possibly implement at the time but that might be optimal for
    a computer that could be built 10 to 15 years out. A small team of researchers
    would have ample time to develop the infrastructure necessary for a novel computer
    that would be relevant the day it’s finally switched on. I spent several months
    in the late ’90s studying the underpinnings of Moore’s law, trying to understand
    where it runs thin and where it holds strong. At the time, the strongest limitation

    8085）的后代，今天仍作为烤面包机的大脑使用。为什么？因为在向后兼容的CPU上运行现有代码几乎总是比将旧代码移植到新的微架构上更快。鉴于这一事实，在我的论文中，我设计了一个当时没人能实现的微架构，但这个架构可能适用于10到15年后才能建造出来的计算机。一小队研究人员将有充足的时间开发出这种新型计算机所需的基础设施，并且这种计算机在启动的那一天将是切实相关的。我曾在90年代末花费数月时间研究摩尔定律的基础原理，试图理解它在哪些方面变得薄弱，在哪些方面依然强大。当时，最强的限制是光速，因此我的论文围绕如何减少通信延迟的架构技巧展开。

    core count, continues to increase over time, but the pace is decelerating. Transistor
    count used to double once every 18 months; then it slowed down to double less
    than once every 24 months. Eventually, transistor density scaling will effectively
    end. The absolute endpoint for transistor scaling is a topic of debate, but one

    18 个月翻一倍；后来放慢到每 24 个月不到翻一倍。最终，晶体管密度扩展将实际上终止。晶体管扩展的绝对终点是一个有争议的话题，但一项研究^([†](footnote.xhtml#fn21))

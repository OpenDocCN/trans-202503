    *Intents*, Android’s mechanism for allowing applications to launch other apps
    to handle specific actions, like “take a picture” bringing up a camera app, or
    “send an email” launching an email app. An application could register the Intents
    it could handle in its *manifest* (a file that is bundled along with an application
    that contains summary information about the app). Having the information available
    in the manifest file instead of just in the code of the application itself meant

- en: Wei dove into Google Talk first and was able to get a demo working quickly.
    One of the things that helped get it going was that Google Talk (which already
    existed as a desktop app, with a complete backend on Google servers) used a very
    full-featured protocol for sending messages (XMPP^([7](#c23-footnote-7))), so
    it was relatively straightforward for Wei to write an app to set up a connection

- en: One of the hard parts with turning his app from a demo into a product was maintaining
    that connection between the server and the client. The connection would frequently
    drop, but the client wouldn’t find out and would continue sending messages without

- en: Once the rudiments of the system were working, Michael Morrissey, who was leading
    the services team, suggested using this connection for all the Google apps (including
    Gmail, Contacts, and Calendar). Instead of each of those apps having to maintain
    its own connection to the backend, they could all share this single, persistent
    connection. Software on the device would combine app data to send to the server
    through this single pipe and would receive responses from the server and deliver
    them to the appropriate applications. This was a similar architecture to the one
    at Danger that Michael had helped set up.

- en: This connection was available not only to the existing apps; it was potentially
    available for pushing messages from other apps as well. Charles Mendis, for his
    Bounce application, wanted to be able to notify the Maps app when friends’ locations

  zh: 运营商测试使得像这样的通信项目变得复杂。榕解释道：“有很多运营商合规认证的事情，这让我疯狂。尤其是MMS标准非常复杂。你可以用它做很多事情，比如制作幻灯片、图像动画和播放声音。尽管大家都知道，实际上任何人最想做的事情就是只发送一张图片，但你必须实现所有功能，因为必须通过运营商认证。”
- en: In June of 2008, Ficus, Wei, and Peisun flew over to China to work with the
    contractors. Sichuan had just had a major earthquake, so they met in Beijing and
    worked out of the Google office for two weeks.

- en: 'Ficus remembered a later trip to work with the same team: “Summer of 2008,
    trying to ship. None of the prototype devices could leave the supervision of a
    Google employee. All of the contractors were in Chengdu, China. We’d previously
    met in Beijing, but this was during the Olympics and we couldn’t get a place to
    meet. We had to find a place that had a GSM network, and a Google office so that
    we could have these test devices, and that the engineers could get a visa to.
    So we met in Zurich for two weeks.”'

  zh: 榕记得后来一次与同一团队合作的旅行：“2008年夏天，尝试发布。所有的原型设备都不能离开谷歌员工的监督。所有承包商都在中国成都。我们之前在北京见过面，但那时候正值奥运会，我们无法找到合适的地方开会。我们得找到一个有GSM网络和谷歌办公室的地方，这样我们才能带着这些测试设备，并且工程师们能获得签证。因此，我们在苏黎世待了两周。”

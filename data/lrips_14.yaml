  zh: “我们到了，女孩。帮我整理一下船。”
- en: “The . . . boat? What b—” she opened her eyes. The walls were made of wood,
    and it was Winsome, not Laurie’s mother, who wanted her to wake up. Of course—Laurie
    was still on the *Doppelganger*.

  zh: “那……船？什么船——”她睁开眼睛。墙是木头做的，是Winsome，而不是Laurie的妈妈，叫她醒来的。原来——Laurie还在*双胞胎*号船上。
- en: Laurie went above deck and got her first look at Abstract Island. The *Doppelganger*
    was tied up at the end of the main pier. The little harbor was a perfect half-moon.
    All around the docks, people were fishing or fussing around on identical boats.
    On land, identical houses and shops were scattered among trees and hilly parks.

  zh: Laurie上了甲板，第一次看到了抽象岛。*双胞胎*号船停靠在主码头的尽头。小港口呈完美的半月形。码头四周，人们在钓鱼或在相同的船上忙碌着。陆地上，房屋和商店与树木和丘陵公园交错分布。
- en: “Hey, Winsome, why do all of the buildings look the same?” Laurie asked. “And
    the trees, too!”
  id: totrans-9
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “嘿，Winsome，为什么所有的建筑看起来都一样？”Laurie问。“连树也一样！”
- en: “That’s how they do things here. First they talk *endlessly* about what makes
    a building, or a street, or a pigeon. Once they find the perfect abstract design,
    they make a bunch of copies. Let’s go get some breakfast and then deliver these
    letters.”
  id: totrans-10

  zh: “这儿的做法是这样的。他们先*不停*地讨论什么构成了一栋楼、一条街，或者一只鸽子。一旦找到了完美的抽象设计，他们就复制一堆。我们去吃早餐，然后送这些信吧。”
- en: Winsome lifted a huge mail bag and headed down the pier. Laurie had to hurry
    to keep up.
  id: totrans-11

  zh: Winsome举起一个巨大的邮袋，朝码头走去。Laurie得赶紧跟上。
- en: There were many restaurants around the harbor. The Philosopher’s Diner was packed
    with old people wearing togas, and at Random Slice Pizza you never knew what toppings
    you’d get. It was too early for pizza, though.

  zh: 港口周围有许多餐馆。哲学家的餐厅挤满了穿着托加的老年人，而在Random Slice Pizza，你永远不知道会得到什么配料。不过现在太早了，没法吃披萨。
- en: They took a booth at the Push & Pop Café and ordered full stacks of pancakes.
    Instead of cutting through the whole pile of pancakes, Winsome ate them off the
    top of the stack, one by one.

  zh: 她们在Push & Pop咖啡馆找了个座位，点了满满一堆煎饼。Winsome没有从整个煎饼堆里切，而是一个一个地吃掉堆顶的煎饼。
- en: Mystified, Laurie watched Winsome until she could no longer contain her curiosity.
    “Why are you eating your pancakes funny?”
  id: totrans-14
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: Laurie困惑地看着Winsome，直到她再也忍不住好奇心。“为什么你吃煎饼的方式那么奇怪？”
- en: “I’m not eating them funny. *You’re* eating them funny.”
  id: totrans-15
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “我才不是奇怪地吃它们呢，*是你*吃得奇怪。”
- en: Laurie didn’t push the question, but instead tried another. “What should I do
    about my map?” she asked between bites.
  id: totrans-16
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: Laurie没有再追问，而是换了一个问题。“我应该怎么处理我的地图？”她边吃边问。
- en: “Beats me, girl.” Winsome said. “So let’s play a game that will help us figure
    it out.”
  id: totrans-17

  zh: “我也不知道，女孩。”Winsome说。“那我们来玩一个能帮我们弄明白的游戏吧。”

  id: totrans-18

  zh: “什么游戏？”
- en: “It’s called Five Whys. It’s a game to play when you get stuck.”
  id: totrans-19

    we find the reason you got stuck,” Winsome said.

  zh: “我问你一个‘为什么’的问题，你回答，然后我再问你另一个，直到我们找出你卡住的原因，”Winsome说。

  id: totrans-22

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “比如说？”
- en: “For example,” Winsome began, pausing to swallow her last bite of pancake, “why
    do you want to follow that map?”
  id: totrans-23
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “比如说，”Winsome开始说道，停下来咽下最后一口煎饼，“你为什么要跟着那张地图走？”
- en: “It’s the one Hugh Rustic made for me with his ants,” Laurie said. “He found
    a short-enough path through all of the towns.”
  id: totrans-24
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “这是Hugh Rustic用他的蚂蚁做给我的那个，”Laurie说。“他在所有城镇之间找到了一条足够短的路径。”
- en: “So why did you want to find a short-enough path?”
  id: totrans-25
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “那你为什么想找一条足够短的路径？”
- en: “Because there are blippity-million paths through Userland, and Tinker didn’t
    know how to find the *shortest* one,” Laurie said.
  id: totrans-26
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “因为Userland里有成千上万的路径，而Tinker不知道怎么找到*最短*的那一条，”Laurie说道。
- en: “Why did you ask Tinker for the shortest path?”
  id: totrans-27
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “你为什么要问Tinker最短的路径？”
- en: “Because Eponymous said that the Wandering Salesman’s algorithm—well, she didn’t
    say ‘algorithm,’ I figured that out later—she said his algorithm wasn’t sensible.”
  id: totrans-28
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “因为Eponymous说流浪商人的算法——嗯，她当时没有说‘算法’，我后来才搞明白——她说他的算法不合理。”
- en: “Why did you want to use the Salesman’s algorithm?”
  id: totrans-29
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “你为什么要使用商人的算法？”

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “因为我……“劳里没想过这个问题。 “我不知道。”
- en: “You were lost and scared, and he seemed to know what he was doing, right?”
    Winsome asked.
  id: totrans-33
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “你那时迷路又害怕，而他看起来好像知道自己在做什么，对吧？”温索姆问道。
- en: “Yeah, I guess so.”
  id: totrans-34
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “嗯，我想是的。”
- en: “Sweetie, the Wandering Salesman is a *salesman*. He has to visit many places
    to buy and sell,” Winsome said. “And it’s his job to convince people.”
  id: totrans-35
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “亲爱的，流浪推销员是一个*推销员*，他必须走访很多地方买卖，”温索姆说道，“而说服别人是他的工作。”
- en: “Eponymous said that it made sense, though.”
  id: totrans-36
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “Eponymous说它是有道理的，虽然。”
- en: “The Salesman’s algorithm makes sense for *him*, but maybe not for you. It’s
    tempting to jump on the first answer that comes along. But a lot of the time,
    it’s not the best. That’s why you have to keep your head on.”
  id: totrans-37
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “推销员的算法对*他*来说有意义，但对你未必有用。我们很容易被第一个出现的答案诱惑。但是很多时候，它并不是最好的。这就是为什么你必须保持清醒。”
- en: “Why didn’t anybody say anything?” Laurie asked.
  id: totrans-38
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “为什么没人说什么？”劳里问。
- en: “Because it’s up to you to ask the right questions,” Winsome replied. “No one
    is going to live your life for you, girl.”
  id: totrans-39
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “因为你必须问对问题，”温索姆回答说，“没有人会替你过你的人生，姑娘。”
- en: “But I *asked* everyone how to get home!”
  id: totrans-40
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “但是我*问*了每个人怎么回家！”
- en: “No, it sounds like you drifted away from your real goal. By the time you got
    to Rustic, you didn’t ask how to find Hamilton. You asked him how to find a short
    path through all the towns in Userland.”
  id: totrans-41
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “不，你听起来是偏离了你的真正目标。等你到达Rustic时，你没有问如何找到汉密尔顿。你问的是如何找到一条穿越所有Userland城镇的最短路径。”
- en: “Wow, you’re right.” Laurie looked down at her lap. “I feel really stupid now.”
  id: totrans-42
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “哇，你说得对。”劳里低头看着自己的腿。“我现在觉得自己真的很蠢。”

  zh: “没事，别难过。每个人都会犯这种错误。”
- en: “They do?”
  id: totrans-44
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “他们真的有吗？”
- en: “You have no idea,” said Winsome. “Algorithms don’t just happen in turtles and
    ants and coins. They also happen inside your head, and those are the hardest to
    get right.”
  id: totrans-45
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “你完全没概念，”温索姆说道，“算法不仅仅发生在乌龟、蚂蚁和硬币中。它们也发生在你脑袋里，而这些才是最难搞清楚的。”
- en: “I still don’t know how I’m going to get home.”
  id: totrans-46
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “我还是不知道怎么回家。”
- en: “Neither do I. But asking the right question is a good start. And as long as
    you’re here, you might as well be useful.” Winsome pointed out the window to a
    tall white tower on a hill. “Do you see that lighthouse?”
  id: totrans-47
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “我也不知道。但提出正确的问题是一个很好的开始。只要你在这里，不妨做点有用的事。”温索姆指着窗外的一座高耸的白色塔楼说道，“你看见那座灯塔了吗？”
- en: “What about it?”
  id: totrans-48

  zh: “那怎么办？”

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “嗯……当然！听起来很有趣，”劳里说道。

    it to the lighthouse keeper.”
  id: totrans-51

- en: Laurie’s climb up the hill was exhausting, so she stopped at the base of the
    lighthouse to rest a moment before checking for a doorbell or someone to let her
    in. There was no sign of either on the ground floor, so she shouted at the tower.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 劳里爬上山顶非常费力，她在灯塔底部停下，稍作休息，准备找个门铃或者有人开门。地面上没有任何迹象，于是她向塔楼大声喊道。

  id: totrans-58

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 一个声音飘了下来：“看见了！上来吧！门是开着的。”
- en: Round and round up the staircase, Laurie huffed and puffed with the unwieldy
    box, Xor perched on her shoulder. Finally she reached the lighthouse keeper’s
    room at the top of the tower, completely out of breath. The lighthouse keeper
    had his back to her, scanning the horizon with binoculars.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 劳里一边喘气，一边费力地提着那个笨重的箱子，Xor栖息在她的肩膀上。她终于爬到了塔顶的灯塔守卫室，气喘吁吁。灯塔守卫背对着她，拿着望远镜扫描着远方。
- en: “Oh, good,” he murmured. “Put it down carefully.”
  id: totrans-61
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “哦，好吧，”他低声说道，“小心放下。”
- en: Laurie heaved the box onto a bench and took a look around. The room had no walls
    to speak of; it was made almost entirely of glass. Laurie stood next to the lighthouse
    keeper to get a better look out the windows. To one side was the wide blue water.
    She could barely see a bump on the horizon—maybe that was Userland. To the other
    side, all of Abstract Island was laid out like, well, like a map. On the coast
    were the port and the *Doppelganger*. Two people in togas were arguing in front
    of the Philosopher’s Diner. From above, the island looked even more neat and organized.

  zh: 劳里把箱子扛到长椅上，环顾四周。房间几乎没有墙壁，几乎全是玻璃做的。劳里站到灯塔看守人旁边，想从窗户看到更远的地方。窗外一侧是广阔的蓝色海洋。她几乎能在地平线上看到一个小突起——也许那就是用户岛。另一侧，整个抽象岛像地图一样铺展开来。海岸边有港口和*双胞胎*。两个人穿着长袍，在哲学家餐厅前争论。俯瞰整个岛屿，景象更加整洁有序。

  id: totrans-63

    one of the early pioneers of digital money. Chaum studied problems in cryptography
    while completing his PhD at the University of California, Berkeley, and was particularly
    interested in ways people could transfer money digitally and anonymously. He went
    on to create DigiCash in 1992, a company whose mission was to establish a digital,
    anonymous cash system (called *e-cash*). The system used a concept called blind
    signatures to guarantee the anonymity of its users, but a central company or bank
    was needed to ensure that each unit of ecash wasn’t spent twice. Chaum’s was not
    the only digital money company. By the mid-1990s, several private companies were
    developing electronic cash systems, mainly hoping to facilitate online purchases
    in the then nascent Internet. In addition to DigiCash, others—including First
    Virtual Holdings, Cybercash, and even a division of Microsoft—were significantly
    invested in developing digital money solutions. At the time, the use of credit
    cards to make payments via the Internet was rare, and these efforts were seen
    as critical to enabling e-commerce.

    Virtual Holdings、Cybercash，甚至微软的一个部门在内的其他公司也在大力投资开发数字货币解决方案。当时，通过互联网使用信用卡进行支付仍然很少见，这些努力被视为推动电子商务发展的关键。
- en: 'But almost all attempts to create digital money had the same Achilles’ heel:
    A trusted middleman was needed to keep track of everyone’s transactions. Unfortunately,
    many companies like DigiCash had much difficulty garnering that kind of trust
    from consumers and banks (whose cooperation they also needed). The reluctance
    was understandable: If a company operating a digital money system collapsed due

    companies was that a government agency might force them to close. Digital currencies
    were such recent inventions that the regulations to manage them were absent or

    of the primary advantages of e-cash. These impediments, combined with slow adoption,
    forced DigiCash to declare bankruptcy in 1998\. Other companies faced even worse
    fates. Gold & Silver Reserve Inc., which maintained a gold-backed digital currency

    less than 0.05 percent as powerful as the Bitcoin network. This incredible growth,

- en: '• **Portability:** In a perfect world, money should be light, compact, and
    easily transported. By this measure, bitcoins easily trounce paper currency: Bitcoins
    weigh nothing, are stored effortlessly even in large quantities, and can be moved
    across the world within minutes. Of course, as part of a world financial system,
    electronic mechanisms are available for storing and transporting traditional currencies
    in digital form, improving the portability of those currencies as well. However,
    in terms of simplicity, cost, and speed of portability, Bitcoin has clear advantages
    at this time.'

- en: • **Divisibility:** Everyone knows the frustration of needing to pay someone
    a small dollar amount but only having a large bill and no change. This problem
    cannot exist with bitcoins since bitcoins are completely divisible to fractions
    of a penny. Because computers are efficient at crunching numbers, it’s no surprise
    that they can handle the task of dividing Bitcoin amounts in any way necessary
    to make change.

  zh: • **可分性：** 每个人都知道，想付给别人少量的钱却只有大钞而没有零钱的沮丧感。比特币不存在这个问题，因为比特币可以完全分割成分的零头。由于计算机在处理数字方面非常高效，能够根据需要将比特币的金额划分成任何必要的部分以找零，毫不意外。
- en: • **Durability:** By design, every bitcoin is stored within the Bitcoin block-chain,
    a computer file that is stored on many thousands of computers across the world.
    As long as a person doesn’t lose the private key that protects their money, that
    person’s bitcoins are indestructible. On the other hand, the US Federal Reserve
    estimates the life span of a dollar bill at 5.9 years.^([12](../Text/footnote.html#footnote30))
  id: totrans-60

- en: Of course, another aspect of durability is that the value of a bitcoin must
    be maintained into the future. Although the value of a bitcoin in the future is
    unpredictable and volatile day to day, it has generally increased from year to
    year. One can certainly argue, however, that durability of Bitcoin in terms of
    maintaining its value is not a certainty until the network of users grows much
    larger.
  id: totrans-61

  zh: 当然，耐用性的另一个方面是比特币的价值必须得以保持到未来。尽管比特币的未来价值不可预测，并且每天都有波动，但它的价值一般是逐年增长的。然而，人们可以肯定地说，直到比特币的用户网络大幅增长之前，比特币在保持其价值方面的耐用性还不是一个确定的事情。
- en: • **Scarcity:** The primary innovation of Bitcoin is the decentralized creation
    of scarcity for a digital asset, which is necessary for bitcoins to retain any
    monetary value. Therefore, like paper money, bitcoins can maintain a limited supply.
    However, with paper money you need to trust the government (i.e., the owner of
    the printing presses) to maintain this scarcity over time and hence prevent inflation.
  id: totrans-62

  zh: • **稀缺性：** 比特币的主要创新在于去中心化地为数字资产创造稀缺性，这是比特币保持任何货币价值的必要条件。因此，像纸币一样，比特币可以保持有限的供应。然而，对于纸币来说，你需要信任政府（即印刷机的拥有者）在时间的推移中维持这种稀缺性，从而防止通货膨胀。
- en: • **Fungibility:** It’s important for any dollar bill—or any bitcoin—to be equally
    valid for payment. If a recipient of money constantly needs to worry about whether
    they have received “good money” or “bad money,” the utility of the currency is
    damaged. As you know, paper money can be traced physically by tracking the serial
    numbers on bills or electronically through tracing mechanisms built into our modern
    electronic payment system. Similarly, bitcoins are traceable by following coins
    through the public blockchain. Hence, neither traditional currency nor Bitcoin
    has a clear advantage in terms of fungibility.

  zh: • **可替代性：** 任何一张美元纸币或任何一个比特币都必须在支付中具有相等的有效性。如果收款人总是需要担心自己收到的是“好钱”还是“坏钱”，那么货币的效用就会受到损害。正如你所知，纸币可以通过追踪纸币上的序列号或通过我们现代电子支付系统中内置的追踪机制进行物理或电子追踪。同样，比特币也可以通过在公共区块链上追踪币的流转来追溯。因此，无论是传统货币还是比特币，在可替代性方面都没有明显优势。

- en: A proof-of-stake mining reward doesn’t require the same considerable energy
    expenditure required by a proof-of-work currency, like Bitcoin. However, it isn’t
    clear whether proof-of-stake-based currencies are as secure as proof-of-work-based
    ones. Just as proof-of-work-based systems are “vulnerable” to a 51 percent attack,
    proof-of-stake-based systems have their own vulnerabilities (51 percent attacks
    are described in detail in [Chapter 8](../Text/ch08.html#ch08)). Although we know
    that a 51 percent attack in a proof-of-work-based system requires extraordinary
    resources and is economically irrational for the attacker, attacks on proof-of-stake-based
    systems may be easier than on proof-of-work-based system. Peercoin mitigates this
    issue by combining proof-of-stake with some additional proof-of-work to maintain
    stronger security. NXT addresses this issue by adding nuances to the consensus
    mechanism to decide which blocks are valid, potentially sacrificing some decentralization
    in the process.

  zh: 权益证明挖矿奖励不需要像工作量证明货币（如比特币）那样大量的能源消耗。然而，是否基于权益证明的货币与基于工作量证明的货币一样安全仍不清楚。正如基于工作量证明的系统容易遭受51%攻击一样，基于权益证明的系统也有其自身的漏洞（51%攻击在[第8章](../Text/ch08.html#ch08)中有详细描述）。虽然我们知道，基于工作量证明的系统要遭受51%攻击需要巨大的资源投入，并且对攻击者来说经济上不具理性，但对基于权益证明的系统的攻击可能比对基于工作量证明的系统的攻击更容易。Peercoin通过将权益证明与一些附加的工作量证明结合，来增强安全性。NXT则通过为共识机制增加细节来决定哪些区块是有效的，可能在这个过程中牺牲一些去中心化。

    as to the practicality of proof-of-stake. Even so, it is an interesting concept
    with the attractive benefit of dramatically reducing the energy requirements for
    operating cryptocurrency.

    increase and nobody will actually want to spend them, making the currency useless
    (or worse, leading to dangerous deflation).

- en: This argument relates to the economic concept of *Keynesian economics*,^([13](../Text/footnote.html#footnote33))
    which maintains, among other ideas, that frequent injection of new currency into
    the economy helps promote its growth. Regarding Bitcoin, Keynesians will argue
    that the inability of governments to print more currency units would seriously
    damage economic growth.^([14](../Text/footnote.html#footnote34)) They contend
    that the scarcity enforced by Bitcoin’s cap would drive *nominal deflation*, which
    is when the price of everyday goods denominated in bitcoins would drop over time,
    causing the circulation of the currency to freeze up and forcing the economy into
    a depression. The rationale is that individuals would postpone their purchases
    in anticipation of lower prices for goods in the future.

- en: Bitcoin supporters counter the Keynesian arguments with ideas based in the philosophy
    of *Austrian economics*. This economic philosophy argues, among other ideas, that
    the price of a unit of currency has the ability to adjust appropriately on its

    levels, no matter how many units of currency exist at any point in time in the

  zh: '**比特币与政府稳定性**'
- en: Some contend that a successful Bitcoin system would be harmful because it could
    destabilize governments. It has been debated that Bitcoin is part of a larger
    movement, recently termed *radical decentralization*, which maintains that all
    decentralization (including the functions of the government) is desirable and
    possible. This idea is a direct extension of the philosophies of Friedrich Hayek,
    who reasoned that local control is usually preferable to central control, because
    local people have more knowledge about local conditions and can therefore behave
    more efficiently in most situations. However, it is true that governments benefit
    from having control over their currency supply. Governments encounter challenges
    when they attempt to raise funds via direct taxation, and printing money to fund
    government projects is known as “taxing by inflation,” which is both easier for
    governments to do and harder for citizens to stop. The loss of this means of raising
    money for government projects (including military defense) could reduce the financial
    viability of some governments.

  zh: 一些人认为，成功的比特币系统可能会有害，因为它可能会导致政府不稳定。有人辩称，比特币是一个更大运动的一部分，最近被称为*激进去中心化*，该运动认为所有去中心化（包括政府职能）都是可取且可能的。这一理念直接延伸自弗里德里希·哈耶克的哲学，他认为地方控制通常比中央控制更好，因为地方居民对当地情况有更多了解，因此在大多数情况下能更高效地行动。然而，确实，政府从控制货币供应中获益。政府在通过直接征税筹集资金时遇到挑战，且为了资助政府项目而印刷货币被称为“通过通货膨胀征税”，这对政府来说较为容易，而对公民来说则更难制止。失去这种为政府项目（包括军事防御）筹集资金的手段，可能会减少一些政府的财政可行性。
- en: 'However, Bitcoin is not the only recent technology that is decentralized by
    design: BitTorrent, Gnutella, Tor, and Freenet are similarly immune to central
    control. Clearly, computers allow us to explore the idea of decentralization,
    and its merits and potential faults, in ways that were not possible before the
    Internet revolution. Many of these decentralized systems were thought to pose
    risks to government stability (especially the Internet in countries with oppressive
    laws against free speech), but we accepted them anyway due to the enormous benefits
    they brought to society. The loss of control by governments, in the case of the
    Internet, was compensated (and then some) by increased economic productivity.
    Computer engineers are continually pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with
    decentralized networks, trying to drive financial contracts (such as software
    projects like Ethereum^([15](../Text/footnote.html#footnote35))) or communication
    systems (such as Bitmessage^([16](../Text/footnote.html#footnote36))) toward decentralized
    systems as well. Only time will tell what kind of impact these systems will have

    of Google. Even though the tiny Android startup was absorbed into the much larger
    company, Andy went out of his way to keep the team separate.

  zh: 从一开始，Android 就拥有一种与 Google 其他部门截然不同的文化。尽管这个小型的 Android 初创公司被吸收入了更大的 Google 公司，Andy
    还是尽力保持团队的独立性。
- en: Jason Parks said, “Andy and the leadership team realized for this to succeed
    we needed to be separate from the larger Google culture and come up with our own
    culture to make this happen. I don’t know how he sold it to Eric, Larry, and Sergey,
    but he got it done. We were isolated and operated like a small startup, with funding
    from Google.”

  zh: 杰森·帕克斯说：“Andy 和领导团队意识到，为了成功，我们需要与更大的 Google 文化保持独立，创造我们自己的文化来实现这个目标。我不知道他是怎么说服埃里克、拉里和谢尔盖的，但他做到了。我们被孤立起来，像一个小型初创公司一样运营，资金来自
    Google。”

    of the company “gave the team breathing room without having to constantly report
    in to big-G Google to do things.”

  zh: 迈克·克莱伦说，Andy 故意让团队与公司其他部门保持独立，“给了团队喘息的空间，不必不断向大 G Google 汇报工作。”
- en: Not everyone on the team agreed with this approach. Mike Fleming said, “Android
    was walled off from Google. That was really a top-down decision. I remember feeling
    that that wasn’t a good idea and feeling opposed to that idea. I really wanted
    us to connect and build bridges and participate in Google culture. That really
    didn’t happen.”

    Google 文化。但这根本没有发生。”

    project secret within the company and not participating in larger discussions
    and company meetings, which the team felt would have bogged things down.

  zh: Android 的独立性在很多方面得以体现，包括将项目保密，并且不参与更大的讨论和公司会议，团队认为这些会让进展变慢。
- en: All of these dynamics helped keep the team focused on the single goal of shipping
    every release. But much like the physical separation of Australia from the rest
    of the world’s continents resulted in bizarre subspecies, Android developed a
    culture that was different, and a bit more reckless, than that of its larger,
    steadier, corporate parent.

  zh: 所有这些动态都有助于保持团队专注于一个目标——发布每个版本。但就像澳大利亚与其他大洲的物理隔离导致了奇异的亚种一样，Android 发展出了与其更大、更稳重的企业母公司不同的文化，甚至有点更加鲁莽。

    that it endowed on the team. “We were a little startup within Google. We were
    shielded from the rest of the big company. We were this little enclave, and we

    towards that mission.

- en: 'One of the things that kept Android separate from the rest of Google was that
    it was a fundamentally different product from what everyone else at Google worked
    on. Google, at the time, developed primarily web applications. This resulted in
    two important implications with respect to Android: unhappiness within Google
    that Android was not web-based, and incomprehension of the timeframe realities
    of mobile software.'

  zh: 使 Android 与 Google 其他部门保持独立的原因之一，是因为它是一个与 Google 其他产品截然不同的产品。当时的 Google 主要开发
    Web 应用程序。这导致了两个重要的后果：一是 Google 内部不满 Android 不是基于 Web 的，二是无法理解移动软件的时间框架现实。
- en: First, there was a core distrust of what Android was doing because Google was
    fundamentally about web technologies. So much was possible using the web at that
    time; why wasn’t Android based around web technologies instead? The fact that
    other mobile platforms at the time (including Palm’s WebOS and even the iPhone,
    where Apple’s original plan for external developers was web apps) were using web
    technologies bolstered this argument. Yet Android stubbornly refused to go in
    that direction.^([2](#c30-footnote-2)) It offered the ability to integrate web
    content in native applications (through WebView, as well as offering a complete
    browser app), but applications were expected to be built with native (not web)
    technology, including a different language, different APIs, and overall different
    approach than web apps.

  zh: 首先，安卓所做的事情曾经遭到核心的不信任，因为谷歌本质上是一个专注于网络技术的公司。那时通过网络可以做很多事情；为什么安卓不是基于网络技术呢？当时其他移动平台（包括Palm的WebOS，甚至iPhone，苹果最初对外开发者的计划是基于网络应用）的确是使用了网络技术，这进一步支持了这一论点。然而，安卓固执地拒绝走这条路^([2](#c30-footnote-2))。它提供了在原生应用中集成网页内容的能力（通过WebView，并提供了完整的浏览器应用），但应用程序的开发仍然要求使用原生（而非网络）技术，包括不同的编程语言、不同的API，以及与网页应用截然不同的整体开发方法。
- en: Second, Android was trying to ship a fundamentally different kind of product
    from the web app products that Google was used to writing. If you want to ship
    a new version of Search, you could do it this afternoon. And if there’s a bug
    in that version, you could fix it and update the app later tonight. Web products
    tend to have regular releases every few weeks, and teams launch and iterate constantly.
    But Android had very different constraints that made that approach and that mindset
    unworkable.

  zh: 其次，安卓试图推出一种与谷歌习惯写作的网络应用产品完全不同的产品。如果你想发布一个新的搜索版本，你可以今天下午就完成。如果那个版本有bug，你可以修复它并在今晚更新应用。网络产品通常每几周就会有一次常规发布，团队会不断进行发布和迭代。但是安卓有着非常不同的限制条件，这使得这种方法和思维方式在安卓中无法实施。
- en: 'Brian Jones explained: “In Android, there’s a hardware component, there’s a
    manufacturing component, there’s a carrier component, there are partnerships.
    You can launch and iterate a search algorithm. You can’t launch and iterate a
    piece of hardware. You have to set a date and work backwards.”'

  zh: 布赖恩·琼斯解释道：“在安卓中，有硬件组件、制造组件、运营商组件，还有合作伙伴关系。你可以发布和迭代搜索算法，但你不能发布和迭代硬件。你必须设定一个日期并从后往前倒推。”
- en: 'Brian Swetland agreed: “The reality is, when you’re trying to ship consumer
    electronics, and somebody’s committing a factory line, or they’re lining up a
    big marketing campaign to hit their sales targets, you can’t miss or you really
    mess up things for your partners. You get a little crazy when you’re trying to
    hit those deadlines, because the consequences if you miss the window . . . you
    might not be able to ship that product three months later. You might *never* be
    able to ship that product, because now you have to build a whole different product.”'

  zh: 布赖恩·斯威特兰德表示同意：“现实情况是，当你试图发布消费电子产品时，假如有人正在投入生产线，或者正在准备一个大规模的营销活动以实现销售目标，你不能错过，否则你真的会给合作伙伴带来麻烦。当你试图赶上这些最后期限时，你会变得有些疯狂，因为如果你错过了这个窗口……你可能三个月后都无法发货。你甚至*永远*都可能无法发货，因为你现在必须重新构建一个完全不同的产品。”
- en: 'Swetland compared this approach to that of Google teams outside of Android:
    “It’s all web stuff: you ship it, and if it doesn’t work, you roll it back. It’s
    not quite as easy when you’re burning images at the factory.”^([3](#c30-footnote-3))'

- en: 'Chiu-Ki Chan, who had transferred onto the Android team from elsewhere in Google,
    talked about this hardware-driven dynamic: “Android was the first team that taught
    me that Christmas ends in October. If you want your device to hit the market for
    Christmas, everything has to be done by October. It was such crazy deadlines because
    boards^([4](#c30-footnote-4)) had to be finalized. It was the first time that

    built against the previous version of the SDK would run on the newer version (Android
    always tries to maintain forward compatibility), but applications built against
    the new version might not run on the old version (because use of new APIs that

    distribute their own keyboard applications. Also, there was a new sensor and logic
    to detect rotation, so users could rotate their phone for landscape versus portrait
    mode display. Prior to that change, users needed to slide out the keyboard on
    the G1, which automatically put the display into landscape mode.

- en: The Donut release rounded out various pieces of the platform for general use.
    The telephony stack now supported CDMA, the system used by Verizon (this would
    come in handy with, for example, the Motorola Droid, which launched on the Verizon
    network). The framework team finished adding support for arbitrary screen sizes
    and densities, which was important in enabling a broader ecosystem of all kinds
    of different form factors.^([4](#c43-footnote-4)) Donut also included a speech-to-text
    engine. It was not nearly as powerful as the systems used in phones today but
    was an indicator of where things could go.

    was that it was implemented in conjunction with the new Droid and Passion (Nexus

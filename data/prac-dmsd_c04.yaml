    about ecosystem collapse are rooted in reasonable science and solid historical
    precedent. For example, massive volcanic activity has been implicated in the Permian
    extinction event that wiped out 70 percent of vertebrate life about 250 million
    years ago,^([12](b02.xhtml#c04-endnote-12)) and one of the still-active supervolcanoes—the
    Yellowstone Caldera—is believed to be capable of covering much of the United States
    in 10 feet of ash.^([13](b02.xhtml#c04-endnote-13)) Similarly, the impact of a
    large asteroid or comet is widely believed to have been the culprit of the Cretaceous–Paleogene
    extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs,^([14](b02.xhtml#c04-endnote-14)) and
    the pockmarked face of our own moon is a reminder that such cosmic events happen
    in our neighborhood with some regularity.

  zh: 与本章讨论的其他一些话题相比，关于生态系统崩溃的许多担忧根植于合理的科学和扎实的历史前例。例如，大规模的火山活动被认为与二叠纪灭绝事件有关，这次事件约2.5亿年前消灭了70%的脊椎动物生命^[12](b02.xhtml#c04-endnote-12)，而一个仍在活跃的超级火山——黄石大火山——被认为有能力将美国大部分地区覆盖上10英尺的火山灰^[13](b02.xhtml#c04-endnote-13)。同样，许多人普遍认为，一颗大型小行星或彗星的撞击是导致白垩纪-古近纪灭绝事件的罪魁祸首，这次事件导致恐龙灭绝^[14](b02.xhtml#c04-endnote-14)，而我们月球那布满坑洞的面庞提醒我们，这种宇宙事件在我们身边有时会以某种规律发生。
- en: 'That said, while the possibility of a planetary catastrophe cannot be dismissed,
    all available evidence suggests that the cadence of extinction-type events is
    extremely long: a disaster that has a 50 percent probability of occurring in the
    next million years carries less than a 0.01 percent chance of striking within
    the lifetime of any person born today. In that sense, although a supervolcano
    or a cosmic collision may be some of the most profound existential threats to
    reckon with, they’re also relatively distant concerns—and they escape most attempts
    to meaningfully model or mitigate the impact they may eventually have.'

    of Mount St. Helens blanketed several states with ash and necessitated extensive
    cleanup efforts in the populated parts of Eastern Washington. In 1908, a massive
    explosion known as the Tunguska event, widely believed to be the result of a large
    meteorite blowing up in the atmosphere, flattened a remote portion of the Siberian
    taiga in a radius of about 20 miles. But such events, however frightening, don’t
    spell the end of days. In terms of their impacts and potential countermeasures,

    voices in the scientific community have warned us against a range of more novel
    planetary risks. The first wave of such predictions focused on the population
    growth worries of Ehrlich (see Chapter 1), as well as the “peak oil” hypothesis
    formulated by M. King Hubbert in 1956—incorrectly predicting an irreversible decline
    in global oil production capacity starting somewhere in the 1970s, and interpreted
    as the promise of a dark and energy-starved world.^([16](b02.xhtml#c04-endnote-16))

    to spread radiation—and indeed, this happens only to a limited extent. In its
    most common mode of operation, the bomb is detonated high above the target, and
    derives the bulk of its destructive power from the release of a tremendous amount
    of thermal energy, as mentioned before, with a devastating secondary shockwave
    caused by the expanding gas. The burst of radiant heat can instantly cause lethal
    burns and set wooden structures on fire, while the shockwave flattens buildings
    and uproots trees. This mechanism explains why people who stood in the shadow
    of a sturdy wall or kneeled in a ditch managed to survive the bombings of Hiroshima
    and Nagasaki, even as others nearby perished in the blast. The phenomenon also

    tens of miles away. The intense radioactivity of the fallout is a major problem,

- en: In the early years of the US nuclear program, it was discovered that if a nuclear
    explosion is set off at a very high altitude, the resulting gamma radiation knocks
    out electrons from the upper atmosphere, forming a layer of charged plasma and
    sending a flurry of electrons hurling toward the ground at relativistic speeds.
    This charge separation produces a surprisingly high voltage gradient across hundreds
    or thousands of miles of land in the shadow of the blast, potentially disrupting
    electronics, communications, and the power grid in a manner broadly similar to
    the CME phenomenon discussed earlier in the chapter.

    known for certain is that the initial pulse is far more sudden than in the case
    of solar storms, possibly rendering traditional surge protectors and other automatic
    safety equipment less effective. Beyond that, perhaps the most compelling analysis
    comes from a governmental commission formed to study the threat in the mid-2000s.
    The committee didn’t paint a particularly bleak picture, but also didn’t discount
    the threat, noting that “it is not possible to precisely predict the time to restore
    even minimal electrical service due to an EMP eventuality given the number of
    unknowns and the vast size and complexity of the system with its consequent fragility
    and resiliency.”^([19](b02.xhtml#c04-endnote-19)) In other words, we don’t know

    strengths of approximately 30 kV/m or above. In an actual EMP exposure, these
    vehicles would glide to a stop and require the driver to restart them. Electronics
    in the dashboard of one automobile were damaged and required repair. Other effects
    were relatively minor. Twenty-five automobiles exhibited malfunctions that could
    be considered only a nuisance (e.g., blinking dashboard lights) and did not require

- en: Notation was waiting in the hall when Frank emerged from the captain’s office.
    “How’d it go?” she asked the moment he shut the door.

  zh: Notation 正在大厅里等，当 Frank 从队长办公室出来时。她在他关门的瞬间就问道：“怎么样？”
- en: “Well enough,” said Frank. “He didn’t yell, and I’ve got another three months’
    rent for my office.” He held up a small bag of coins.

  zh: “还行，”Frank 说道。“他没有对我吼，我又多了三个月的办公室租金。”他举起一袋小硬币。
- en: “That’s it?” asked Notation, her voice laced with disappointment.

  zh: “就这些？”Notation 问，声音中带着失望。
- en: “What were you expecting?” asked Frank. “A commendation? They don’t give commendations
    to private eyes. But I hear you got one, and a promotion. Well done, Detective
    Notation. It’s quite a step up.”

  zh: “你期待什么？”Frank 问。“奖状？私家侦探是不会得到奖状的。但我听说你得到了一个，还升了职。做得好，侦探 Notation。这可算是晋升了。”
- en: Notation blushed. “Thank you,” she said. “But what about you? I thought . .
    . maybe . . .”

  zh: Notation 脸红了。“谢谢，”她说道。“那你呢？我以为……也许……”
- en: “You thought the captain would ask me to come back,” Frank filled in. “In fact,
    he tells me you recommended it.”

  zh: “你以为队长会让我回来，”Frank 填补道。“事实上，他告诉我，是你推荐的。”
- en: Notation turned a bright shade of red. “You’re a skilled detective,” she said.

  zh: Notation 脸红得像火一样。“你是个出色的侦探，”她说道。
- en: Frank laughed. “He didn’t offer me a job.” Seeing the look on Notation’s face,
    he added, “Don’t take it personally. He was never going to offer me a spot on
    the force again. The captain and I have a long history, longer than a single case
    can erase. Anyway, the private eye life suits me better.”

  zh: Frank 笑了。“他没给我工作机会。”看到 Notation 脸上的表情，他补充道，“别太在意。他根本不会再给我机会回到警队。队长和我有着很长的历史，单单一个案件是无法抹去的。总之，私家侦探的生活更适合我。”
- en: “So you just go back to . . .”

  zh: “是啊，”Notation 说道。“那个。”
- en: “As a matter of fact, I’ve been presented with a new opportunity.” He held up
    his hand to stop her before she could get too excited, and added, “As an independent
    contractor.”

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “事实上，我得到了一个新机会。”他举起手制止她在她太兴奋之前继续说下去，并补充道，“作为一名独立承包商。”
- en: “What is it?” asked Notation.
  id: totrans-13

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “那是什么？”Notation 问。
- en: “It appears there’s a league of wizards out there, trying to free Exponentious
    and take over the kingdom.”
  id: totrans-14

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “看起来外面有一个巫师联盟，试图解救 Exponentious 并接管王国。”
- en: Notation smiled. “I’m familiar with them. I seem to recall that I recently helped
    arrest one of their more active members.”
  id: totrans-15

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: Notation 微笑着。“我很熟悉他们。我似乎记得我最近帮忙抓住了他们一个更活跃的成员。”
- en: “One of their more active members, yes, and dedicated members, for sure. But
    it’s possible that he was also one of the less capable members. Princess Ann is
    concerned that Socks’s attempted prison break will inspire some of the league’s
    more senior and competent members.”

  zh: “他们其中一个更活跃的成员，没错，确实是个忠诚的成员。但也有可能他是其中一个能力较弱的成员。安娜公主担心，Socks 尝试越狱会激励联盟中一些更资深、更有能力的成员。”
- en: “So you’re investigating the League of Unnecessary Complexity? As an independent
    contractor, of course.”
  id: totrans-17
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “所以你在调查‘不必要复杂性联盟’？当然，是作为独立承包商。”
- en: Frank nodded. “It’s a tough search problem—find all the members of a secret
    evil organization. But it just so happens that search problems are my specialty.”
  id: totrans-18

  zh: Frank 点了点头。“这是一个棘手的搜索问题——找出所有一个秘密邪恶组织的成员。但恰好，搜索问题正是我的专长。”

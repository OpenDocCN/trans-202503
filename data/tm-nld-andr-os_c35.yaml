- en: In late 2009, a year after 1.0 shipped, Android institutionalized extra working
    hours by starting the tradition of *Bacon Sundays*. Previously, people would simply
    be at work all the time. But eventually, people started spending weekend time
    *not* working. But Android still had the same do-or-die dynamic as it did before
    (albeit with more people to handle the load). Release deadlines were critical;
    they *had* to hit those dates. So toward the end of a release, management encouraged
    people to come to the office on Sunday morning with the promise of a big breakfast
    buffet spread (along with plenty of work). Participation wasn’t required, and
    not everybody came in on those Sundays. But there was an understanding that there
    was a lot of work to do, and a team effort would help.

  zh: 2009年末，也就是1.0版本发布一年后，安卓开始了额外工作时间的制度，启动了*培根星期天*的传统。以前大家都是经常加班。但渐渐地，人们开始把周末时间*不*用来工作了。不过安卓依然保持着那种生死存亡的紧迫感（尽管有更多的人来分担工作量）。发布截止日期至关重要；他们*必须*按时完成。因此，在发布的最后阶段，管理层鼓励大家在周日早晨来办公室，承诺会有丰盛的早餐自助（当然，还有大量的工作）。参与并非强制，但不是每个人都会在周日来。不过大家都知道还有很多工作要做，团队的努力可以帮助完成。
- en: Hiroshi Lockheimer came up with the idea. “We were behind schedule for the Droid—we
    were probably behind our fourth schedule—and that was a Big Deal. There was a
    big launch, with a lot of marketing behind it, so we were like ‘Shit, what do
    we do? Gotta come in on weekends and make it happen.’

  zh: 库罗西·洛克海默（Hiroshi Lockheimer）想出了这个主意。“我们在Droid的进度上落后了——我们大概已经落后到了第四个进度表——那是个大问题。那时有一个大规模的发布，背后有很多营销支持，所以我们就想，‘完了，怎么办？必须周末加班，搞定它。’”
- en: “I wanted to make it fun. I love bacon. In retrospect, not everyone likes bacon,
    so bacon probably was not the best choice. I don’t eat it that much anymore. Turns
    out it’s not good for your health.

    our software by a certain date or else they were going to miss the holiday season.

- en: “It was clear we needed more time. The only way I could think of to get more
    time was to work on weekends. So Sundays—not every Sunday—but in the summer it
    became kind of a . . . in retrospect, kind of a sad tradition.”

- en: By 10:00 in the morning (it’s difficult to get most engineers in the office
    earlier than that, breakfast or no), there would be a full, catered spread with
    brunch goodies, including a large tray of bacon. People wandered into the cafeteria,
    ate their fill and caught up with co-workers, then headed to their desks to continue
    working on the product.

  zh: 到了早上10点（要让大多数工程师在那之前到办公室实在不容易，不管有没有早餐），就会准备好一桌丰盛的早午餐，包括一大盘培根。大家走进餐厅，吃饱后和同事们聊一聊，然后回到工位继续工作。

- en: Bacon Sundays went away by the time the team shipped KitKat, in the Fall of
    2013\. The team had grown, so there were simply more people available to help
    hit the deadlines. Also, the releases were not as frequent as they were in the
    early days, so there wasn’t as much constant schedule panic. Finally, management
    recognized that enough was enough, and people wanted their weekend lives back.

  zh: 培根星期天在2013年秋季团队发布KitKat时就结束了。团队规模扩大了，所以有更多人可以帮助完成截止日期的工作。而且，发布的频率不像早期那么高了，所以也没有那么频繁的时间表危机。最后，管理层认识到该休息了，人们渴望找回他们的周末生活。

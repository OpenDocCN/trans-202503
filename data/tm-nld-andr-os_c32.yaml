- en: Behind the wall plate was . . . nothing. It was just a USB port embedded in
    the wall. It was a prank. Or, rather, it was engineers (specifically, Brian Jones,
    Joe Onorato, and Bruce Gay) with more hardware than plans. They carefully cut
    a hole in the drywall, and with a mixture of hot glue and inspiration, they inserted
    a USB port borrowed from an old workstation. Bruce added a label to make it look
    more official. They had no plans for anything more elaborate; they just thought
    it was funny sitting there, doing nothing. Google Security didn’t share that feeling.

  zh: 墙面板背后是……什么都没有。它只是一个嵌入墙里的USB端口。原来是个恶作剧。或者，更准确地说，是一些工程师（特别是布莱恩·琼斯、乔·奥诺拉托和布鲁斯·盖）拥有了比计划更多的硬件。他们小心地在干墙上切了个洞，凭借热熔胶和灵感，将一个从旧工作站借来的USB端口插了进去。布鲁斯还添加了标签，试图让它看起来更正式。他们并没有更复杂的计划；他们只是觉得它放在那里什么都不做，挺有意思的。谷歌安全部门并不这么认为。

  zh: 劳伦·伊普森整整一个上午都在森林里迷路。可怜的女孩不知道自己身在何处，也不知道该往哪里走。
- en: It had all started with an argument. Her mother wanted her to go to summer school,
    and naturally Laurie didn’t want to go. “Children in other countries go to school
    year round,” her mom said. “We aren’t in other countries,” Laurie replied. “Extra
    classes are how to get ahead,” Mom said. “Summer is for having fun,” Laurie insisted.
    The argument went on and on and got loud near the end. To calm down, Laurie took
    a walk in the woods.

  zh: 一切始于一次争吵。她妈妈希望她去上暑期学校，而劳里自然不想去。“其他国家的孩子全年上学，”她妈妈说。“我们又不在其他国家，”劳里回答。“额外的课程有助于领先，”妈妈说。“夏天是用来玩乐的，”劳里坚持说。争论持续不断，到最后甚至有些激烈。为了冷静下来，劳里决定去森林里散步。
- en: When people are faced with something they don’t want to do, they often do something
    they aren’t allowed to do instead. Before long, Laurie had gone farther into the
    woods than she had ever gone before.

    right up to Laurie and began nuzzling her hand in a very un-beast-like way.

    had red and black stripes. Black tree trunks split into two red branches. Those

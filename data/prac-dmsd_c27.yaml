    revolvers and semiauto pistols can be chosen in a way that provides a comfortable
    shooting experience while still packing enough punch. This is done by matching

    Although many shooters like to brag about how they can take the punishment in
    stride, the reality is that any extended range session will leave you sore—and
    if you don’t brace the gun perfectly, bruises are likely to follow too. Small-bore
    shotguns, capable of taking 20-gauge^([*](#c27-footnote-2)) or .410-caliber shotshells,
    are available on the market and are much easier to manage—but the choice of ammunition
    is far more constrained, and the reduction in power has obvious downsides.

- en: The predominant shotgun bore size is 12 gauge (about 0.73 inches), and the most
    common design is a tube-fed pump-action—a mechanism found on the Remington 870,
    Mossberg 590, and countless other models from manufacturers big and small. That
    said, for shooters who want to take some edge off the recoil without tacking on
    an oversized shoulder pad, a semiautomatic shotgun can offer substantial relief;
    here, Remington V3 is probably the best pick in its class. The gotcha is that
    a semiauto may not cycle reliably with low-power shells, such as rubber baton
    rounds; the mechanism is factory-calibrated for conventional loads that pack far
    more punch.

    jacket (FMJ)* bullets are made of solid metal and tend to pass through soft materials
    without deforming to a significant extent. *Jacketed hollow point (JHP)* ammunition
    has a small cavity in the front of the bullet, sometimes filled back with plastic.
    On impact, the pressure inside this cavity rapidly builds up, causing the bullet
    to mushroom and decelerate.

- en: A less common in-between variant is known as *soft-point.* This ammunition has
    a solid core made from soft metal and a jacket made of a harder alloy, enclosing

    somewhat similarly to JHP.

- en: FMJ ammunition is commonly used for target practice, primarily because of its
    lower cost. Hollow-point bullets are preferred for self-defense because they deliver
    their energy to the intended target more efficiently and are less likely to overpenetrate
    and hit bystanders. At the same time, because it’s reputed to cause more severe
    wounds, JHP ammunition is banned in some parts of the world. Still, where legal,
    it’s the more rational pick. However morbid this sounds, you don’t pull the trigger
    when you want to cause only a tiny bit of harm.

  zh: FMJ弹药常用于靶场练习，主要因为其较低的成本。自卫时更偏好使用空尖弹（Hollow-point）子弹，因为它们能更有效地将能量传递给目标，并且不容易过度穿透击中旁观者。与此同时，空尖弹（JHP）因被认为会造成更严重的伤害而在一些地区被禁止。但在合法的地方，它仍然是更理性的选择。尽管这听起来有些令人不适，但你不会在只想造成一点伤害时才扣动扳机。
- en: 'For shotguns, the ammo choices are different. There are three basic types of
    shotshells: bird shot, buckshot, and slugs. *Bird shot* consists of hundreds of
    tiny metal spheres, traveling independently and meant to take out waterfowl and
    other critters. Bird shot is common in hunting but may not pack enough punch and
    not offer sufficient precision in self-defense situations that involve distances
    of more than perhaps 10 yards. *Buckshot* is a variation of this idea, consisting
    of a smaller number of much larger projectiles, each delivering about as much
    damage as a pistol round. When fired from the distance of about 10 to 15 yards,
    buckshot will impact an area roughly the size of the palm of your hand and will
    almost certainly kill anything in its path. Finally, *slugs* are single bullets
    of considerable size and mass. When they hit something, they punch a rather massive
    hole. They’re about as lethal as buckshot, but remain accurate and effective over
    longer distances—at the expense of requiring better aim.'

    it’s loaded. Many accidents happen because people trust their memory, their habits,
    or the assurances of others—but mistakes happen, and with a deadly tool, it’s
    essential to double-check. If you don’t know how to clear a particular gun of
    ammunition, it’s crucial to ask for help or check on the internet before messing
    with it. In semiautomatic firearms with removable magazines, always check the
    chamber *after* removing the mag. Removing the magazine alone isn’t a guarantee
    of safety. Although some firearms may be designed not to fire without a magazine,
    this isn’t universally true—and the interlock mechanism that ensures this property
    can malfunction too.'

  zh: 枪支安全的第一条规则很简单：在拿起枪支时，假设它已经上膛。许多事故发生是因为人们相信自己的记忆、习惯或他人的保证——但错误是难以避免的，而枪支作为致命工具，必须反复确认。如果你不知道如何排除枪械中的子弹，必须寻求帮助或在网上查找相关信息，再进行操作。在带有可拆卸弹匣的半自动枪支中，移除弹匣后务必检查枪膛，*不要只依赖*移除弹匣这一操作来确保安全。虽然某些枪支设计上没有弹匣时不会开火，但这并非普遍适用——确保这一特性的联锁机制也可能发生故障。
- en: The second rule is rooted in the assumption that you’ll eventually mess up rule
    1, and it stipulates that when handling a gun, you should always keep it pointed
    somewhere safe. At the shooting range, this is toward the backstop. At home, the
    safest direction may be toward the ground. Accidentally muzzle-sweeping other
    people when manipulating a gun is a serious faux pas.

- en: The third rule assumes that you might eventually break rules 1 and 2; it instructs
    you to keep your finger off the trigger until the gun is aimed at the target and
    you’re ready to fire. The simplest way to accomplish this is to rest your index
    finger on the frame or the stock of the firearm just above the trigger guard.

- en: The final rule is to know your target and what’s behind it. This can mean several
    things. During outdoor target practice, you may want to place the target against
    a hill or other natural feature that will stop any stray rounds. In self-defense

    any people nearby. You don’t want to shoot a drunk family member or a confused

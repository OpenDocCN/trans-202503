- en: We live in times that are simultaneously disquieting and awe-inspiring for many
    people. Technological change is accelerating and impacting every facet of our
    lives in new, unanticipated ways. Although many people feel threatened by automation,
    artificial intelligence, and ubiquitous computers, others feel energized and excited
    to engage with these innovations and the incredible potential they present.

  zh: 我们生活在一个既让许多人感到不安，又令人敬畏的时代。技术变革正在加速，以新的、出乎意料的方式影响着我们生活的各个方面。尽管许多人对自动化、人工智能和无处不在的计算机感到威胁，但也有人对这些创新和它们所带来的巨大潜力感到充满活力和兴奋。
- en: An educator born in the 1970s has witnessed incredible change in their lifetime.
    If they were privileged enough, they might have gone to schools that had one or
    two computers as a curiosity. Now they’re seeing everything from dedicated computer
    labs to schools providing Wi-Fi to students who carry phones with more computing
    power than the supercomputers of just a half-century ago. They saw chess programs
    evolve from being novice players to beating grandmasters. They saw programming
    hobbyists transition from painstakingly copying programs from magazines to instantly
    forking entire programs from online repositories.

  zh: 一位出生于1970年代的教育者在他们的一生中见证了巨大的变化。如果他们足够幸运，可能曾经上过只有一两台电脑作为新奇的学校。现在，他们看到的从专用计算机实验室到学校为携带手机、拥有比半个世纪前超级计算机还强大计算能力的学生提供Wi-Fi的场景都有。在他们的见证下，国际象棋程序从初学者水平逐渐发展到击败国际象棋大师。他们看到编程爱好者从费力地抄写杂志上的程序到可以立即从在线代码库中分叉整个程序。
- en: Whether you react to this accelerating change with excitement or trepidation
    can often correlate with how confident you feel assimilating to it. Computers
    have grown more powerful by leaps and bounds throughout recent decades, and that
    can be unnerving. But they’ve also grown far more accessible during that same
    time, and that should feel inspiring.

  zh: 无论你是以兴奋还是恐惧的心情应对这种加速的变化，通常都与你对其适应能力的信心有关。近年来，计算机的功能飞速提升，这让人感到不安。但它们在同一时期也变得更加易于获取，这应该令人感到振奋。
- en: Computer science teachers have the potential to send more inspired students
    into the world. To teach computer science is to demystify computer systems and
    infuse students with a sense of amazement for them as our collective human accomplishment.
    We can instill students with wonder and excitement for whatever is coming next.

  zh: 计算机科学教师有潜力将更多充满灵感的学生送入社会。教授计算机科学就是要揭开计算机系统的神秘面纱，并赋予学生对它们作为我们共同人类成就的敬畏感。我们可以激发学生对未来一切即将到来的事物充满奇思妙想和兴奋感。
- en: Computer-literate students have the potential to manifest remarkable creations.
    Children who understand conditional logic can invent engaging games to share on
    the playground. A student with cursory programming skills can execute a single
    line of code that drastically changes a web page. Students who are comfortable
    with code can take snippets from many sources to assemble explorable explanations
    that will enlighten and delight their peers. These students are making magic,
    and when they bring others into these realms they’ve engineered, they inspire
    others to make magic.

  zh: 计算机知识渊博的学生有潜力创造出令人瞩目的作品。懂得条件逻辑的孩子可以发明有趣的游戏，在操场上与人分享。一位拥有初步编程技能的学生可以执行一行代码，极大地改变一个网页。那些对代码熟悉的学生可以从多个来源提取代码片段，组装出可以探索的解释，启发并取悦他们的同学。这些学生正在创造魔法，当他们把别人带入这些他们所创造的领域时，他们激励着别人去创造魔法。

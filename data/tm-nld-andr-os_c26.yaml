    Linux is a great example of this. While the original system was written by a single

    to do this and hosts many active (and cobwebbed) projects that show off the work
    of people who took enough time and care to finish and upload the code instead
    of just letting it fester on their local system. Open sourcing your own pet projects

    their own capabilities, companies often open source projects (applications or

    it difficult to convince developers to join based on the excitement of their business
    alone. But they are well-known in the developer community as a provider of interesting

    product. Sometimes a company decides to shut down a project and move those engineers
    onto a project with a brighter future. The company could, and often does, simply
    kill the product. But they could also release the old code into open source, as
    a gift to the developer community. The company does not see direct benefits by
    giving it away (in fact, it usually costs some effort and time to migrate projects
    to open source), but they can earn goodwill from developers by doing this, and
    reduce the pain of killing something that those developers were using and depending

    Android does get regular contributions from some partner companies. For example,
    partners tend to fix bugs to make things work the way they need them to for their
    devices. Maybe they noticed a corner case that they could improve, or a form factor
    that Android did not yet account for, or maybe they just found and fixed a bug.
    It makes sense for them to integrate it directly into Android itself so that they
    don’t have to re-apply that fix every time a new version of Android is released.
    And Android does get some individuals contributing fixes occasionally. But external
    contributions are rare; most of what is there has come from the internal engineering
    team.

  zh: 事实上，外部贡献并不常见……也不是预期中的情况。Android确实会收到一些合作伙伴公司的定期贡献。例如，合作伙伴通常会修复bug，以确保他们的设备能正常运行。也许他们发现了一个可以改进的边角案例，或者Android尚未考虑到的设备外形，或者他们仅仅是发现并修复了一个bug。对他们来说，将修复直接集成到Android中是有意义的，这样每次Android发布新版本时，他们就不需要重新应用这个修复。而Android偶尔也会有一些个人贡献修复。但外部贡献仍然很少；大部分代码都来自于内部工程团队。
- en: There are a few reasons for this dynamic. For one thing, the Android source
    base is huge, and contributing even a simple fix takes significant effort just
    to understand the context of the original code and implications of that change.
    But a more significant reason is Android’s “eventual open source”^([4](#c26-footnote-4))
    model itself. An external developer wouldn’t have any way of knowing, when they
    found and fixed a bug, whether that bug had been fixed in the meantime in the
    internal/future version of the code, or even whether that block of code they’ve
    been spending all of their time working with even existed anymore. Code has a
    tendency to move around or get rewritten when future requirements or changes dictate.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这种动态背后有几个原因。一方面，Android的源代码库非常庞大，即便是一个简单的修复，也需要投入大量的精力来理解原始代码的上下文以及该修改的影响。更重要的原因是Android的“最终开源”^([4](#c26-footnote-4))模式本身。外部开发者无法得知，当他们发现并修复了一个bug时，是否该bug已经在内部/未来版本的代码中修复，甚至他们所专注的那一段代码是否仍然存在。代码有时会因为未来的需求或变更而被移动或重写。
- en: But even though Android doesn’t benefit from substantial external contributions,
    Android's open source model still provides significant advantages. First, application
    developers love it. A platform of the size and complexity of Android could never
    be documented so completely that a programmer could understand every nuance of
    it and how everything interacted internally. The ability to look at the actual
    code to determine what’s really going on is invaluable; developers don’t need
    to guess at what the platform is doing if they can look at the code itself. This
    transparency has always helped Android developers in writing their apps and represents
    a fundamental difference between Android and many other operating system platforms.^([5](#c26-footnote-5))

    Android 开发者编写他们的应用程序，这也是 Android 与许多其他操作系统平台之间的根本区别的体现。^([5](#c26-footnote-5))

    Android was new, said that the code availability simplified development: “There
    were plenty of early platform bugs to deal with. I remember there being lots of

- en: 'The second, and arguably more important, element of Android’s open source model
    is that Android’s partners have free and easy access to all of it. This was actually
    the original reason for Android open sourcing the platform; it was a mechanism
    to make Android available for any prospective device manufacturer to get everything
    they need. There is no licensing and there are no protracted contract negotiations;
    partners can simply go to the website and get the bits they need to ship an Android-based
    device. And in so doing, they help to enable a consistent ecosystem of compatible
    Android implementations, because everyone is starting from the same common implementation.
    If they want to get Google services like the Play Store and Maps and Gmail, then
    there’s more to it, but the core code for building a phone platform is available
    for anyone to download and use as is. Romain Guy explained: “That’s what we all

    Android 可用。没有许可证，也没有冗长的合同谈判；合作伙伴可以简单地访问网站并获取他们需要的组件来制造基于 Android 的设备。通过这样做，他们有助于实现一致的兼容
    Android 实现的生态系统，因为每个人都从相同的公共实现开始。如果他们想要获取像 Play Store、Maps 和 Gmail 这样的 Google
    服务，那就有更多内容，但用于构建手机平台的核心代码可以供任何人下载和使用。Romain Guy 解释道：“这就是我们在谈论 Android 的‘开源’时的想法。合作伙伴并不一定关心贡献，但他们拥有他们所需的一切。”

- en: 'Dianne Hackborn agreed, comparing Android’s open source model to the licensing
    model she’d seen fail in previous experiences: “One of the things we struggled
    with at PalmSource in getting others to use our platform was that they were deathly
    afraid of someone doing to the mobile space the same thing that Microsoft did
    to PCs. For example, Motorola had a really hard time thinking about licensing
    Rome [PalmSource’s UI toolkit built for Palm OS 6] but were all-in on buying the
    company and owning it. Being able to make Android open source made it a lot more
    comfortable for OEMs to adopt, since they could share some ownership of it, as
    well as making it extremely flexible for the rapid evolution of mobile devices.”'

  zh: Dianne Hackborn 也表示同意，并将 Android 的开源模式与她之前所经历的授权模式进行了比较：“我们在 PalmSource 时遇到的一个问题是，其他公司对使用我们的平台非常害怕，他们害怕移动领域会重蹈微软当年对
    PC 做的事情。例如，摩托罗拉曾对授权使用 Rome（PalmSource 为 Palm OS 6 开发的 UI 工具包）感到非常困难，但他们对收购公司并拥有它却毫不犹豫。能将
    Android 做成开源，使得 OEM 更容易接受，因为他们可以共享一部分所有权，并且它的灵活性也使得移动设备能够快速演进。”
- en: It is this second element, opening up the platform for device makers, that distinguished
    Android from other platform offerings out there. Not only was the platform available
    to use, but the code was available to understand and play with as companies got

    to license (and pay for) Windows from Microsoft. Also, the process of getting
    it to work on a new device was non-trivial. Michael Morrissey was working at Microsoft
    prior to Android and got to see that process first-hand. “When you were trying
    to bring up a new OS, whether it was Win CE or Pocket PC or whatever on a new
    phone, trying to integrate those things and debug bringing that up was incredibly
    painful. You had this thing called the ‘Board Support Package,’ which was all
    the low-level code that came from the OEM. And then you had all the higher-level
    Windows code. So if phone calls were failing, or the network was bad, or whatever,

    PC 还是其他什么系统，整合这些东西并调试其运行是极其痛苦的。你需要有一个叫做‘板级支持包’的东西，它包含了来自 OEM 的所有底层代码。然后，你还需要所有更高层的

    would send somebody over to Seattle, and they would sit next to somebody in this
    team. They would try to debug it without really letting each other see each other’s

    manufacturers to use, which was an added bonus. Michael said, “These OEMs would
    operate on pretty thin margins. So if you have a company like HTC and they’re
    getting charged $10/unit by Microsoft, and they have to do a whole crazy bunch
    of integration work with Microsoft in order to get it to work, the idea of free
    and open source is magic. If you have Android, which is open source, then your

- en: On the other hand, if you wanted to ship an iOS-based device . . . you couldn’t.
    Apple is the only manufacturer of the iPhone; they don’t make their platform available

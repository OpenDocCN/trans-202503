  zh: 但在 Android 和 iPhone 出现之前，这种简单的生态系统并不存在。
- en: It’s not that companies didn’t want it to exist; they kept trying to create
    something like it. You could buy services from carriers (mostly ringtones and
    simple utilities), and there were various repositories for games. But the market
    for apps wasn’t there (since there wasn’t a lot that apps could do on those limited
    devices, at that time), so users weren’t missing much. But once there were devices
    powerful enough to run real applications, users needed an easy way to get them.

  zh: 并不是公司不想要这样的存在；他们一直在尝试创造类似的东西。你可以从运营商那里购买服务（主要是铃声和简单的工具），也有各种游戏库。但当时，应用市场并不存在（因为当时那些有限的设备上应用能做的事情不多），所以用户也没有错过什么。但一旦出现了足够强大的设备来运行真正的应用，用户就需要一种便捷的方式来获取它们。
- en: But carriers had created *walled gardens*^([1](#c22-footnote-1)) where they
    controlled access to the earlier app stores. They wanted to ensure that malicious
    or bad apps couldn’t take down their network, so they didn’t want random applications
    running on their network that they could not control. They created curated places,
    like the app store on the Danger phones. But that extra layer of process and hassle
    dissuaded many developers from uploading apps, and prevented larger app store
    ecosystems from coming into being.

  zh: 但运营商已经创建了*围墙花园*^([1](#c22-footnote-1))，他们控制着早期应用商店的访问权限。他们希望确保恶意或不良应用不会破坏他们的网络，因此不希望无法控制的随机应用在他们的网络上运行。他们创建了精选平台，比如
    Danger 手机上的应用商店。但这种额外的流程和麻烦劝退了许多开发者上传应用，也阻碍了更大规模应用商店生态系统的形成。
- en: 'Android wanted to fix this problem with Android Market. They wanted a store
    that anyone could upload apps to. Michael Morrissey, who was leading the services
    team on Android, told Nick Sears his goal: “I want a fourteen-year-old kid sitting
    in Kansas to be able to write an app in the morning and upload it in the afternoon
    to Android Market and have it go out to sell to all the customers.”'

  zh: Android 想要通过 Android Market 解决这个问题。他们希望创建一个任何人都可以上传应用的商店。负责 Android 服务团队的 Michael
    Morrissey 告诉 Nick Sears 他的目标：“我希望堪萨斯州的一个十四岁孩子，早上写完一个应用，下午就能上传到 Android Market，并且能够销售给所有的用户。”
- en: This concept concerned T-Mobile (Android’s launch partner for the 1.0 device,
    the G1). How could they verify that that kid in Kansas couldn’t upload something
    that would take down their network?

  zh: 这个概念涉及了 T-Mobile（Android 1.0 设备 G1 的首发合作伙伴）。他们如何验证堪萨斯州的那个孩子无法上传会导致网络崩溃的内容呢？
- en: And so began a long discussion between Android and T-Mobile to iron out the
    details that would make this work. There were two things that the Android team
    had to do to get T-Mobile to agree. First was assuring T-Mobile that their network
    would be safe. Second was allowing them to have their own curated app store, alongside
    Android’s.

  zh: 于是，Android 和 T-Mobile 开始了长时间的讨论，以解决如何确保这一切能够顺利进行的细节问题。Android 团队必须做两件事才能让 T-Mobile
    同意。首先是确保 T-Mobile 的网络是安全的。其次是允许 T-Mobile 拥有自己的精选应用商店，并与 Android 的商店并存。
- en: The first item, safety, began with having a secure platform. Given the kernel-level
    sandboxing of apps, the team was able to convince the carrier that Linux security
    standards would be sufficient. Next, the team required that developers actually
    sign in, and used existing infrastructure and policies vetted on YouTube to validate
    that the individual did not present an unreasonable risk for the company. Also,
    they used the power of crowd-sourcing, putting in place a system whereby users
    could report bad apps and the team would take them down. Finally, they convinced
    the carrier that, as much as T-Mobile would suffer if they had network problems,
    so would Google. Android’s, and Google’s, reputation was on the line. So Android
    had all the right incentives to make this system work and for the apps and network
    to be secure and safe.

  zh: 第一项，即安全性，从确保平台的安全开始。由于应用在内核级别的沙箱化，团队能够说服运营商，Linux 安全标准足以满足需求。接着，团队要求开发者进行身份验证，并利用现有的基础设施和
    YouTube 上验证过的政策，确保开发者不会给公司带来不合理的风险。此外，他们还利用众包的力量，建立了一个系统，允许用户报告不良应用，团队会将其下架。最后，他们说服了运营商，正如
    T-Mobile 如果遇到网络问题会受损，Google 也会受到影响。Android 和 Google 的声誉都岌岌可危。因此，Android 拥有了所有必要的激励，确保这个系统能够正常运作，确保应用和网络的安全。
- en: For the second item, a custom store for T-Mobile, Google created what Nick called,
    “a store within a store.” The actual application store was on Google’s infrastructure,
    but T-Mobile was offered primary placement within the store for a limited set
    of apps that they curated. This placated T-Mobile enough to get them to that first
    release. But eventually this just went away; other carriers didn’t demand this
    as part of their deals, and everyone realized that there was no particular reason
    for this requirement. All of the work was on Google to manage that infrastructure,
    and the open application store system seemed to be working.

  zh: 对于第二项，Google 为 T-Mobile 定制了一个商店，Nick 称之为“店中店”。实际的应用商店运行在 Google 的基础设施上，但 T-Mobile
    被提供了一个主要位置，用于展示他们精选的有限应用集。这样做足以让 T-Mobile 满意，促使他们达成首次发布。然而，最终这个做法消失了；其他运营商并没有在协议中要求这一点，大家也意识到没有特别的理由需要这种要求。所有的工作都由
    Google 来管理这个基础设施，而开放的应用商店系统似乎在正常运行。

    an application store on the platform. Now they just had to build it.

- en: The application store for Android was developed in the services team, which
    was responsible for Google services and device management. But the team hired
    other people to figure out how to host and sell applications. The project was
    called *vending machine* internally. When it launched, it was called Android Market.^([2](#c22-footnote-2))

  zh: Android 的应用商店由服务团队开发，该团队负责 Google 的服务和设备管理。但该团队还聘请了其他人员来研究如何托管和销售应用。这个项目在内部被称为*自动售货机*。发布时，它被命名为
    Android Market。^([2](#c22-footnote-2))
- en: Having an application store was always part of the plan. But the project started
    late, since the top priority was shipping the 1.0 release and the G1\. When the
    G1 launched, Market was there, but it was clearly not a finished product. For
    one thing, it was called Market Beta.^([3](#c22-footnote-3)) More significant,
    users couldn’t actually purchase applications. Instead, all apps could be downloaded
    for a cost of . . . $0\. While the mechanisms of developers uploading their apps
    to Market and users downloading apps to their phones worked, the additional step
    of charging users (and paying developers) took more time and effort. The initial
    version of Market was great for users who want free stuff, but it wasn’t as good
    for developers, who usually want to be paid for their efforts.^([4](#c22-footnote-4))

  zh: 拥有一个应用商店一直是计划的一部分。但这个项目启动得较晚，因为当时的首要任务是发布 1.0 版本和 G1。当 G1 发布时，Market 已经上线，但显然还不是一个完善的产品。首先，它被称为
    Market Beta。^([3](#c22-footnote-3)) 更重要的是，用户实际上无法购买应用。相反，所有应用都可以免费下载，价格是……$0。尽管开发者上传应用到
    Market、用户下载应用到手机的机制是有效的，但收取用户费用（并支付给开发者）的额外步骤却需要更多的时间和精力。Market 的初始版本对于那些喜欢免费应用的用户来说非常合适，但对于通常希望获得报酬的开发者来说就不太友好了。^([4](#c22-footnote-4))
- en: The team brought in some much-needed expertise from the Google payments team.
    Arturo Crespo helped pull together the necessary infrastructure that allowed Market
    to process payments for applications. By the time Android 1.1 launched, in February
    of 2009, Market had the ability to sell applications (and developers had the ability
    to make money from their Android apps).

- en: Market was one of the attractions of Android in the early days. It was easy
    to upload an application to the store and make it available to the growing set
    of Android users. Dan Lew, an external Android developer working on travel apps
    at the time, said, “I worked on a bunch of silly side project apps. Android was
    a good place for that because putting up a nearly pointless app on the Play Store
    is relatively painless.”

- en: But Market was more than a convenience for developers and for users; it helped
    create a world of apps that made Android a powerful ecosystem that went way beyond
    the phones people bought and the operating system running on those phones. Users
    were able to benefit from not just the basic phone and built-in capabilities,
    but also from the almost limitless potential of apps that they could install.
    It was Android Market that helped create this powerful dynamic for the Android
    platform overall.

  zh: 但Market不仅仅是为了开发者和用户提供便利；它还帮助创造了一个应用生态，令安卓成为一个强大的生态系统，远远超出了人们购买的手机和运行在这些手机上的操作系统。用户不仅能享受到基础的手机和内建功能，还能从几乎无限的应用潜力中受益，随时安装自己喜欢的应用。正是安卓市场帮助创造了这一强大的生态动态，推动了安卓平台的整体发展。

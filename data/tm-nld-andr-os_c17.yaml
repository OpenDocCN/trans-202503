    would download and use Netscape because that was how you got to the web. But Microsoft
    came out with their own browser, Internet Explorer (IE), eventually bundling it
    with Windows. Bundling IE virtually guaranteed that Microsoft’s browser would
    become the default for most users because it came installed as part of the OS

    browser on MacOS until Apple came out with its own Safari browser in 2003.

- en: For example, a mobile application may want to show content from a website to
    a user. Sometimes it’s better to show that content directly in the app, rather
    than redirecting the user off to a browser app. This dynamic not only enables
    a more seamless experience, but also ensures that the user doesn’t leave the app
    forever. Also, many developers were more familiar with HTML and JavaScript, the

    on their Danger phone, that page would render on the server. The server would
    then reformat the page and send down a simplified version to the phone. This approach
    didn’t give users complete web capability on their phones, because it lacked the

    enabled the browser to display text in a reasonable way on a small display, without
    the larger content area that web page authors envisioned when they wrote the original
    HTML content.

    during her time on the team. There were, after all, only a handful of people supporting
    that large swath of functionality for the first several years of Android’s existence.

    working for the Nexus One launch in early January of 2010\. Grace returned from
    the holidays to find Andy Rubin asking how long it would take to implement that

- en: Cary had a long history in 2D graphics, and browsers, before he arrived on the
    Android team. But his background in programming went back even further. In 1968,
    when he was eleven years old, he got a Digi-Comp I for Christmas. This device
    was not a computer as we know it today, but used plastic and metal parts to perform
    simple boolean and math operations, like counting from zero to seven.^([9](#c17-footnote-9))
    Cary was so fascinated by this machine that he wore it out and asked for the same
    present the following Christmas.

  zh: Cary在加入Android团队之前，已经有了长时间的2D图形和浏览器经验。但他的编程背景更早可以追溯到1968年，当时他11岁，圣诞节收到了一个Digi-Comp
    I。这个设备不像我们今天所知的计算机，而是通过塑料和金属部件来执行简单的布尔运算和数学运算，例如从零到七的计数。^([9](#c17-footnote-9))
    Cary对这个机器非常着迷，以至于把它用坏了，并在第二年圣诞节请求得到同样的礼物。
- en: He upgraded to a used Apple II in the late 70s while he was at college, spending
    so much time learning programming in his dorm room by taking apart Steve Wozniak’s
    BASIC implementation on the Apple II that he flunked out of college. He eventually
    came back and finished his degree, but in the meantime had started working in
    sales at a hobbyist computer store. When customers had questions about their Apple
    computers, Cary would call up the regional Apple tech support office for answers,
    but realized that the staff had no idea how things actually worked. So he applied
    for and got a job there. As part of his job in regional support, he would occasionally
    call Cupertino headquarters, but realized that the support staff there also didn’t
    know enough, so he complained loudly and eventually ended up moving to Cupertino
    and working in the main Apple tech support office.

  zh: 他在70年代末期升级到了一台二手的Apple II，当时他正在上大学，花了大量时间在宿舍里学习编程，拆解史蒂夫·沃兹尼亚克在Apple II上的BASIC实现，结果导致他未能顺利完成学业。后来他回到学校，完成了学位，但在此期间他已开始在一家爱好者计算机商店从事销售工作。当顾客对他们的Apple计算机有疑问时，Cary会拨打地区Apple技术支持办公室的电话来寻求答案，但他发现工作人员根本不知道设备的实际工作原理。于是他申请并获得了这份工作。作为地区支持部门的一员，他偶尔会打电话到库比蒂诺总部，但他意识到那里的技术支持人员也不了解足够的知识，于是他大声抱怨，最终搬到了库比蒂诺，并在Apple总部的技术支持办公室工作。
- en: 'During the development of the Lisa^([10](#c17-footnote-10)) and the Mac, Cary
    moved into management, while still programming on the side. But eventually he
    chose to do software engineering full time: “I was a terrible manager.” He was
    at Apple until 1994, working on various things including leading the effort on
    QuickDraw GX,^([11](#c17-footnote-11)) which was a new 2D graphics library that
    was able to draw much faster than the Mac’s original QuickDraw library. The code
    name for this project was Skia, which Cary chose from a Greek word which referred
    to drawing a shadow on a wall. QuickDraw GX’s main functionality was drawing outlines
    and filling them in, so the code name fit.'

    GX^([11](#c17-footnote-11))的开发，这是一个新的2D图形库，能够比Mac原有的QuickDraw库更快地绘制图形。这个项目的代号是Skia，Cary从一个希腊词中选取了这个名字，该词指的是在墙上绘制影子的动作。QuickDraw
    GX的主要功能是绘制轮廓并填充，因此这个代号十分贴切。
- en: Cary eventually left Apple for other tech companies including WebTV, and Microsoft
    after the acquisition, where he worked with various future Android engineers.
    Cary worked on the WebTV browser, trying to make content intended for desktop
    computers look and interact in a reasonable way on a TV with a completely different
    input mechanism. He eventually moved out of Silicon Valley to Chapel Hill, North
    Carolina, where he worked remotely for Microsoft. There he started talking with
    Mike Reed, whom he knew from his time at Apple. Mike pulled Cary into Openwave,
    where Cary again worked on browser technology. Then Mike, who had left Openwave
    by then, called Cary again, bringing him into his new graphics startup named Skia,
    in honor of Cary’s code name for QuickDraw GX.

- en: When Cary started to work on the Android browser, there were a few problems
    that he had to solve. For example, input was complicated, figuring out how to
    turn keyboard, D-pad, trackball, and eventually touch events into interactions
    on a web page. Mike said, “The first thing that had a touchscreen still had a
    trackball and arrow keys. So we had to live in both worlds. It was somewhat harder
    on the browser, because there were two ways to set the current item of interest
    and focus. You could fling with your finger, or you could hit the down arrow a
    bunch of times. So there was some complication.”

  zh: 当Cary开始参与Android浏览器的开发时，他面临了一些问题需要解决。例如，输入问题非常复杂，需要解决如何将键盘、方向键、轨迹球以及最终的触摸事件转换为网页上的交互。Mike说：“第一款拥有触摸屏的设备仍然有轨迹球和箭头键。所以我们不得不在两种世界中兼顾。浏览器上更困难一些，因为有两种方法可以设置当前的关注项和焦点。你可以用手指滑动，也可以按下箭头键多次。所以这造成了一些复杂性。”
- en: One of those complications was how to navigate through the links on a web page.
    If the user was trying to navigate with the D-pad, there needed to be a way to
    go to the “next” link. So if they tapped the right button on the D-pad, the focus
    needed to shift to the next link to the right. But web pages don’t have a concept
    of links being positioned relative to each other, so it wasn’t obvious which link
    to focus on, based on that user input. Also, Cary had to devise a system for visually
    indicating that a particular link had focus, so the user knew which link would
    be clicked when they pressed the selection button.

  zh: 其中一个复杂的问题是如何在网页中导航链接。如果用户试图使用 D-pad 导航，需要有一种方法来跳转到“下一个”链接。所以如果用户按下 D-pad 上的右键，焦点需要移动到右侧的下一个链接。但网页并没有相对定位链接的概念，因此根据用户的输入，哪一个链接应该获得焦点并不明显。此外，Cary
    还需要设计一种系统来直观地指示某个链接已获得焦点，以便用户知道当他们按下选择按钮时，会点击哪个链接。
- en: Smooth scrolling was another hurdle. Mike said, “Apple set the expectation that
    everybody smooth-scrolls. We were not smooth-scrolling the very first version
    with trackballs and arrows. When we would scroll twenty pixels, we just popped,
    just like every desktop on the planet. And now suddenly, you gotta smooth-scroll
    everything, whether it’s from a finger fling or not. That’s when we really pushed
    hard. Cary invented^([12](#c17-footnote-12)) the Picture^([13](#c17-footnote-13))
    object, which we didn’t have in Skia until then, which is a display list. The
    browser could go through the display lists from all of the slow Java single-threadedness,
    hand it over to a different thread, and then we could fling the picture, draw
    as fast as we can draw, and not have to talk to the browser.”

  zh: 流畅滚动是另一个难题。Mike 说：“Apple 设定了每个人都应该流畅滚动的预期。我们在第一版使用轨迹球和箭头时并没有流畅滚动。当我们滚动二十个像素时，屏幕就跳动，就像地球上所有桌面计算机一样。然后突然之间，你必须让一切都流畅滚动，无论它是手指滑动还是其他。那时我们真的下了很大功夫。Cary
    发明了^([12](#c17-footnote-12)) 图片^([13](#c17-footnote-13)) 对象，这个在 Skia 中之前是没有的，它是一个显示列表。浏览器可以处理所有慢速的
    Java 单线程内容，将其交给另一个线程，然后我们可以尽快地绘制图片，而不必与浏览器进行交互。”
- en: 'Another task was just getting real-world web pages to display reasonably on
    small devices with limited memory. Cary had worked through related issues on the
    WebTV product years earlier, getting web pages intended for desktop computers
    to show up reasonably on TV screens. But the problems he faced for the Android
    browser were new: there was just too much content on web pages, including “pages
    that were just insanely tall. Especially when they were fit to the width of the
    phone screen.”'

  zh: 另一个任务是如何让现实中的网页在内存有限的小设备上合理显示。Cary 多年前在 WebTV 产品上处理过相关问题，成功地将针对桌面计算机设计的网页显示在电视屏幕上。但他在
    Android 浏览器上遇到的问题是全新的：网页上的内容实在是太多了，包括“那些疯狂长的页面，尤其是当它们被适配到手机屏幕宽度时。”
- en: Cary’s favorite example from that time was the Wikipedia page for *cheese*,^([14](#c17-footnote-14))which
    for some reason is a really, really long entry. “It was many hundreds of thousands
    of pixels tall. You couldn’t represent that number of pixels in our math system,
    so we had to figure out how to fix that.”

  zh: Cary 当时最喜欢的一个例子是 *Wikipedia* 上关于 **奶酪** 的页面，^([14](#c17-footnote-14))该页面由于某种原因非常非常长。“它的高度有好几百万像素。我们无法在数学系统中表示这么多像素，因此我们不得不想办法解决这个问题。”
- en: When that problem was addressed, another arose; even if the user could eventually
    see all of the content in a very long page, it took a very long time to scroll
    through it. So Cary implemented a system in the browser that would detect when
    the user was trying to scroll repeatedly and would pop up a magnifier object on
    the page, with a zoomed-out view of the entire page, allowing the user to quickly
    go to a specific location on the page.
  id: totrans-63

  zh: 当这个问题解决后，又出现了另一个问题；即使用户最终能够看到页面上的所有内容，滚动整个页面仍然需要很长时间。所以 Cary 在浏览器中实现了一个系统，能够检测到用户是否在反复滚动，并且在页面上弹出一个放大镜对象，显示整个页面的缩略图，用户可以通过它快速跳转到页面中的特定位置。

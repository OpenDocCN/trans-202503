- en: From the beginning, we wanted this book to be full color. We considered it a
    shame that most books published about GIMP contained color prints in a middle
    section only—or no color at all. We are very grateful to both our publishers for
    having agreed to print in full color, despite the additional costs.

  zh: 从一开始，我们就希望这本书能够全彩印刷。我们认为，很多关于GIMP的书籍只在中间部分有彩色插图——或者根本没有彩色插图，这实在是个遗憾。我们非常感谢我们的出版商，同意全彩印刷，尽管这增加了成本。
- en: 'Our debt to the GIMP developers is immense: The work they did and are still
    doing is tremendous. Moreover, we had the opportunity to ask them some questions,
    using the `gimp-user` and `gimp-developer` mailing lists and the `#gimp` IRC channel.
    They graciously responded to our questions with invaluable first-hand information
    about difficult aspects of GIMP. We’d especially like to thank Alexia Death, Michael
    Hammel, Ramón Miranda, Michael Natterer, Sven Neumann, Martin Nordholts, and Alexandre
    Prokoudine, but many others have also made a vital contribution to the project.
    Many thanks to everyone involved!'

  zh: 我们对GIMP开发者的感激之情无以言表：他们所做的工作以及仍在进行的工作是巨大的。此外，我们有机会通过`gimp-user`和`gimp-developer`邮件列表以及`#gimp`
    IRC频道向他们提问。他们非常慷慨地回应了我们的问题，提供了关于GIMP一些难点的宝贵第一手信息。我们特别要感谢Alexia Death、Michael Hammel、Ramón
    Miranda、Michael Natterer、Sven Neumann、Martin Nordholts和Alexandre Prokoudine，但还有许多人也为这个项目做出了重要贡献。感谢所有参与者！
- en: Several chapters of this book are based on an undergraduate course taught by
    Olivier from 2002 to 2008\. Thus, many examples are inspired by tutorials or other
    sources dating from that time. We would like to acknowledge our debt to the many
    people who created these tutorials (especially in [Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Logos
    and Textures") and [Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Animation")) but whose names
    we no longer remember.

  zh: 本书的几章内容基于奥利维耶（Olivier）在2002到2008年间教授的本科课程。因此，许多示例都受到当时教程或其他资料的启发。我们要感谢许多创建这些教程的人（尤其是在[第4章](ch04.html
    "第4章：标志与纹理")和[第6章](ch06.html "第6章：动画")中的人），尽管我们现在已经记不清他们的名字。
- en: We would also like to thank the LATEX developers and especially Frank Mittelbach
    and Michel Goossens, authors of the *L**A**TEX Companion*, the bible for all LATEX
    users. Olivier owes a special debt to Frank, who kindly helped him to discover
    an old bug in the core of LATEX. He would also like to mention Yannis Haralambous,
    author of the definitive book about fonts and encoding, for his help in getting
    the proper quote in programming examples.

- en: We are very grateful to No Starch Press for enthusiastically accepting our book
    proposal. It is always a pleasure to correspond with Bill Pollock and Tyler Ortman.
    We are also very, very grateful to Patricia Moncorgé, from Pearson France, who
    was the first to accept our book project, including simultaneous publication in
    French and English. Discussions with her have been long, lively, and very fruitful.
    Without Patricia, this book would probably not exist.

    the sanctity of the backyard tool shed and the sanctity of life—but as far as
    the law goes, the two are nothing alike. So, before we go further into this last
    section of the book, let’s talk about something that technically *isn’t* self-defense:
    safeguarding one’s property from destruction or theft.'

  zh: 我们对财物的强烈依附感往往模糊了后院工具棚与生命神圣性的界限——但就法律而言，二者截然不同。因此，在深入探讨本书最后这一部分之前，我们先谈谈一个从技术角度来看*并非*自卫的事情：保护自己的财产免受破坏或盗窃。
- en: To the best of my knowledge, in most of the world, people have the right to
    use a degree of force to protect their belongings. But almost everywhere, this
    force is more limited than what can be used to defend yourself or your loved ones,
    or to protect the lives of strangers on the street. Given the legal peril and
    inherent risk of injury that comes with trying to be a hero, one school of thought
    instructs victims of property crime to simply avoid confrontation and accept their
    fate.

  zh: 据我所知，在世界大多数地方，人们有权使用一定的力量来保护自己的财物。但几乎在所有地方，这种使用的力量比用来保护自己或亲人的生命、或保护街头陌生人生命的力量要有限。考虑到想当英雄可能带来的法律风险和受伤的固有危险，有一种观点认为财产犯罪的受害者应当避免对抗，接受命运。
- en: 'This advice has some merit, of course, but is also rather myopic: submissive
    victims may fare better in the short haul, but over time, their behavior emboldens
    the crooks. The decision to pursue, detain, or fight a thief is never as simple
    as a blog post or a book makes it out to be, but it’s best to make the call with
    a clarity of purpose and a solid understanding of the risk.'

- en: Broadly speaking, the force you can use in the protection of your possessions
    must be reasonable. You might be able to push a mugger aside, forcibly grab what
    they’re holding, or detain them until the cops arrive—but if you intentionally
    or recklessly cause great bodily injury, you would almost certainly be crossing
    the line. In a handful of jurisdictions, deadly force may be permissible to stop
    the commission of certain specifically enumerated property crimes, but about the
    only universally sound defense for causing death or severe injury is that you
    reasonably feared for your own or somebody else’s life—and that the perceived
    threat was imminent and not of your own doing.^([1](b02.xhtml#c25-endnote-1))

  zh: 广义而言，你在保护财物时所使用的力量必须是合理的。你可能可以推开一个抢劫犯，强行夺走他们手中的东西，或把他们控制住直到警察到来——但如果你故意或鲁莽地造成严重人身伤害，你几乎肯定会越过界限。在一些司法管辖区，可能允许使用致命武力来制止某些特定列明的财产犯罪，但造成死亡或严重伤害的唯一普遍合理辩护理由是你合理地担心自己或他人的生命安全——并且所感知的威胁是迫在眉睫的，并非你自己引发的。^([1](b02.xhtml#c25-endnote-1))
- en: The same holds true when it comes to defending your land. Contrary to urban
    legends, it’s unlawful to shoot trespassers in the absence of serious aggravating
    factors, and this holds true in Texas as much as it does in California or in Japan.
    In fact, as noted earlier, in many jurisdictions even pointing a weapon at a stranger
    or displaying it in a menacing way may be a big legal faux pas if you aren’t protecting
    a life.

  zh: 同样的道理也适用于保护土地。与都市传说相反，除非有严重的加重因素，否则在没有严重威胁的情况下开枪打击闯入者是违法的，这一点在德州和加州，甚至在日本都是一样的。事实上，如前所述，在许多司法管辖区，即使你只是对陌生人指着武器或以威胁的方式展示武器，如果不是为了保护生命，这也可能构成严重的法律错误。
- en: Of course, sometimes property-related confrontations spiral out of control.
    If a trespasser starts beating you to a pulp or pulls out a knife, you’re now
    in a self-defense situation and might be justified in using any force necessary
    to stop the assault. On the flip side, if you chase down a fleeing burglar and
    get too carried away dispensing your own brand of justice, you might find yourself
    in trouble—and that’s no matter how big your locality is on property rights.

  zh: 当然，有时候与财产相关的冲突会失控。如果一个闯入者开始暴打你或拿出刀来，你现在处于自卫状态，可能有理由使用任何必要的力量来制止攻击。另一方面，如果你追逐一个逃跑的小偷，并在实施“正义”时过于激动，可能会陷入麻烦——无论你所在的地方在财产权方面有多强。
- en: 'Another thing popular in fiction but verboten in real life is setting traps.
    Any covert device that causes harm to trespassers or burglars could make you liable
    for their injuries or even land you in jail. Some exceptions apply: when an intruder
    knowingly takes a stupid risk and gets hurt (say, climbing over barbed wire),
    or if a freak accident takes place and a burglar is injured by a device not actually
    meant to be a trap, you should be in the clear in most parts of the world. But
    the line is thin. If you build a gator-filled moat and post a sign that reads
    “BEWARE OF GATORS,” for instance, you might still be liable if a child falls in
    or gets snatched by one of your reptilian friends.'

  zh: 另一种在小说中常见，但在现实中被禁止的做法是设置陷阱。任何对闯入者或小偷造成伤害的隐蔽装置，都可能让你对他们的伤害负责，甚至可能把你送进监狱。某些情况下有例外：当入侵者明知冒险并因此受伤（比如，爬过铁丝网），或者发生意外事件，且小偷被非专门设置的装置伤害时，在大多数地方你应该不会被追究责任。但界限很模糊。例如，如果你建了一个充满鳄鱼的护城河，并且贴上“当心鳄鱼”的标志，若一个孩子跌入其中或被你的爬行动物朋友抓走，你仍然可能会负责。

- en: Because the right to defend your property is constrained, and because you’re
    not always there to defend it in the first place, it’s generally better to heed
    the advice in Chapter 10 and focus on deterrence and hassle-free outcomes, rather
    than let everything hinge on the outcome of a fight. Dogs, alarm systems, and

    valuables can limit the losses if burglars get in too.

  zh: 因为捍卫财产的权利受到限制，而且你不一定能时刻在场捍卫它，所以通常更好的做法是听从第10章的建议，专注于威慑和无麻烦的结果，而不是让一切都依赖于打斗的结果。狗、报警系统和运作良好的锁具可以威慑许多犯罪分子。明智地保管贵重物品可以在小偷入室时减少损失。
- en: Another loss-minimization strategy worth mentioning is a well-tailored homeowner’s
    or renter’s insurance policy. Many less common valuables, such as a prized Mr.
    Potato Head collection, may not be covered to any appreciable extent unless explicitly
    itemized on a so-called *floater* attached to the insurance paperwork. Mr. Potato
    Head memorabilia aside, more popular items such as furs, watches, jewelry, precious
    metals, musical instruments, cash, and firearms are frequently subject to steep
    coverage restrictions that will saddle you with the bulk of the loss if the valuables
    aren’t itemized on the policy.

  zh: 另一种值得提到的减少损失的策略是购买量身定制的房主或租户保险。许多不太常见的贵重物品，比如珍藏的“马铃薯头先生”系列，除非明确列出在保险文件附带的*浮动险单*上，否则通常不会得到任何实质性的保障。撇开“马铃薯头先生”的纪念品不谈，更常见的物品如皮草、手表、珠宝、贵金属、乐器、现金和枪支，往往会受到严格的保障限制，如果贵重物品没有在保单上单独列出，损失将由你承担大部分。
- en: In general, many home insurance companies aren’t particularly keen on insuring
    unusual or high-value items and may try to scare you away with mounds of paperwork,
    appraisal requirements, or exorbitant quotes. An insurance company specializing

- en: The desire to maintain an awareness of one’s surroundings drives many preppers
    to explore all sorts of perimeter security devices. The two most common examples
    are passive infrared (PIR) motion sensors or cameras around the home. All too
    often, such solutions become a distraction; for example, in wooded areas, deer
    and other wildlife will cause frequent alerts, especially in the middle of the
    night. In the suburbs, squirrels, raccoons, dogs, and neighbors’ kids are bound
    to give the concerned homeowner headaches as well. Achieving complete coverage
    and ample advance notice of a threat is difficult. That said, the technology can
    still work when deployed more judiciously and on a limited scale. A motion sensor
    overlooking a section of the driveway that’s pruned of vegetation, and another
    device guarding a seldom-used backyard gate, will probably cause relatively few
    nuisance alarms.

  zh: 维持对周围环境的警觉是许多预备者探索各种周界安全设备的动力。最常见的两种设备是家中周围的被动红外（PIR）运动传感器或摄像头。然而，这些解决方案往往会分散注意力；例如，在树林地区，鹿和其他野生动物会频繁触发警报，尤其是在夜间。在郊区，松鼠、浣熊、狗和邻居的孩子也会让关注安全的房主头疼。要实现全面的覆盖并提前预警威胁是非常困难的。话虽如此，当这些技术合理部署且规模有限时，仍然能发挥作用。例如，一个监控修剪过的车道区域的运动传感器，以及另一个守卫不常用的后院大门的设备，可能会减少不必要的报警。

    no business in your driveway, another approach is to make their entry into the

- en: A final line of defense may be window security film manufactured by 3M. If installed
    properly, this transparent material keeps the glass in place even if the window
    is hit with a rock. Compared to window bars or security shutters, the film is
    much cheaper and less unsightly—and is probably as far as a typical household
    would ever need to go, given that a truly determined intruder can always cut or
    even simply punch a hole through the siding and the drywall of a typical stick-frame

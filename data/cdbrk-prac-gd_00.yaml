- en: We both have an interest in classical ciphers and codebreaking, so it was pretty
    much inevitable that our paths would cross someday. This happened in October 2009,
    when we attended the NSA Symposium on Cryptologic History in Laurel, Maryland.
    During the first networking session, we realized that we had much in common. This
    was the start of a friendship that is still enduring, although we live in different
    parts of the world and are separated by about 4,000 miles, as well as lots of
    water (the Atlantic Ocean), with Elonka in Rockville, Maryland, near Washington,
    DC, and Klaus in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. We still meet regularly in Maryland at
    the biennial NSA Symposium on Cryptologic History and other events.

  zh: 我们两人都对古典密码和破译感兴趣，因此我们的道路终究会在某个时刻交汇。这个时刻出现在2009年10月，当时我们参加了在马里兰州劳雷尔举行的国家安全局密码学历史研讨会。在第一次的社交环节中，我们意识到我们有很多共同点。这成为了我们友谊的起点，尽管我们分别住在世界的不同角落，相距约4000英里，还隔着广阔的水域（大西洋），埃隆卡住在马里兰州的罗克维尔，靠近华盛顿特区，而克劳斯则住在德国的吉尔森基兴。尽管如此，我们依然定期在马里兰州相聚，参加每两年一次的国家安全局密码学历史研讨会和其他活动。
- en: 'In 2017, on one such visit, we took a spur-of-the-moment, multi-hour road trip
    down to southern Virginia in order to explore a famous cipher mystery: the Beale
    ciphers (see Chapter 6). This story, about a hidden treasure and three encrypted
    messages that describe its location, is probably a mere hoax, but at least it’s
    a tantalizing one. We went to Bedford, Virginia, to conduct research at its library,
    which had a collection of Beale memorabilia. Then, we ate dinner at Beale’s Beer
    restaurant, sitting next to a large map that showed the notable places of the
    Beale story (Figure 1).'

  zh: 2017年，在一次访问中，我们突发奇想，驱车多小时前往弗吉尼亚州南部，探索一个著名的密码谜团：比尔密码（见第六章）。这个关于隐藏财宝和描述其位置的三条加密信息的故事可能只是个骗局，但至少它是个引人入胜的骗局。我们前往弗吉尼亚州贝德福德，在那里进行研究，图书馆里收藏了许多与比尔故事相关的纪念品。然后，我们在比尔的啤酒餐厅吃了晚餐，餐桌旁的那张大地图展示了比尔故事中的重要地点（图1）。

- en: On our five-hour return trip from Bedford to Washington, DC, by car, we talked,
    among other things, about codebreaking literature and the regrettable fact that
    no up-to-date book about this topic was available. What we wished for was a work
    that covered the solving of authentic ciphertexts, which we kept encountering
    in the form of encrypted postcards, letters, telegrams, diaries, journals, and
    other documents from the past few hundred years. Deciphering such cryptograms
    always provides a firsthand glimpse into a moment of history—something even the
    best crossword puzzle or Rubik’s Cube cannot do.

  zh: 在我们从贝德福德到华盛顿特区的五小时车程中，我们谈到了包括破译文学在内的许多话题，其中令人遗憾的是，市面上并没有一本关于这个主题的最新书籍。我们所期望的是一本涵盖解密真实密文的书籍，这些密文我们经常遇到，通常以加密的明信片、信件、电报、日记、日志和其他几百年来的文献形式出现。解密这些密码总能让我们直接窥见历史的某一时刻——这是即使是最好的填字游戏或魔方也无法做到的。
- en: In addition, we lamented the lack of a codebreaking book that was computer aware
    and covered the numerous software programs and websites available today for solving
    ciphertexts. We also wanted such a book to include the recent codebreaking research
    and fascinating new methods of solving ciphers. No book on the market came even
    close to our expectations. The only ones we could think of were the pre–computer
    age 1939 classic by Helen Fouché Gaines, *Cryptanalysis*, and bits and pieces
    of other books and journals. None of these really scratched the itch by pulling
    everything together.

  zh: 此外，我们还感叹没有一本计算机意识强的破译书籍，能涵盖当今用于解密密文的各种软件程序和网站。我们还希望这本书能够包括最新的破译研究和一些有趣的解码方法。市面上没有一本书接近我们的期望。我们能想到的只有海伦·福谢·盖恩斯在计算机时代之前的1939年经典著作《*密码分析*》，以及其他书籍和期刊中的零散内容。没有一本书能将所有内容整合起来，真正满足我们的需求。
- en: 'By the time we arrived back in Maryland, we had decided we were going to change
    this by co-authoring such a book. The rest is history. The first edition was published
    in 2020, and here we are, years later, putting the finishing touches on the expanded
    edition of *Codebreaking: A Practical Guide*.'

  zh: 当我们回到马里兰州时，我们决定通过共同撰写一本这样的书来改变这种局面。接下来的故事就是历史了。第一版于2020年出版，几年后，我们正在对《*破译：实用指南*》的扩展版进行最后的润色。
- en: Writing a book was nothing new for either of us. Elonka, a game developer by
    trade, has written about cryptography in the past, notably in *The Mammoth Book
    of Secret Codes and Cryptograms* in 2006 and two articles in the 2009 bestseller
    *Secrets of the Lost Symbol*, about Dan Brown’s *Da Vinci Code* sequel. She has
    also created multiple web pages concerning ciphers and codebreaking that have
    received millions of page views on the internet. Klaus has authored some 25 books
    in German (over half of which are about encryption technology), along with 250
    magazine articles, 30 research papers, and 1,600 posts on his *Cipherbrain* blog.
    All of that makes him the most prolific crypto author in the world.

  zh: 对我们俩来说，写书并不是什么新鲜事。埃隆卡是一名游戏开发者，她曾在过去写过关于密码学的文章，特别是在2006年的《*The Mammoth Book of
    Secret Codes and Cryptograms*》一书中，以及在2009年畅销书《*Secrets of the Lost Symbol*》中关于丹·布朗的《*达·芬奇密码*》续集的两篇文章。她还创建了多个关于密码和密码破译的网页，这些网页在互联网上获得了数百万的页面浏览量。克劳斯已经著作了约25本德语书籍（其中超过一半是关于加密技术的），以及250篇杂志文章、30篇研究论文和1600篇《*Cipherbrain*》博客文章。所有这些使得他成为世界上最多产的加密作家。
- en: Despite our experience, co-writing this book was far from a routine project.
    We both had busy day jobs and speaking schedules, which had us constantly traveling.
    Also, as there was an ocean between us, we had to remotely sync our schedules
    to communicate via Skype and Zoom calls across a time difference of five to nine
    hours, depending on which part of the world we were in. We did have two in-person
    meetings, though, to be honest, we did not really use them to work on our book;
    the time was filled with research in libraries, interviewing crypto people, and
    other field trips. We even made a second visit to the home of the Beale ciphers
    in Bedford, Virginia, and a pilgrimage to the George C. Marshall Library in Lexington,
    Virginia, to research the history of the United States’s most famous cryptanalytic
    couple, Elizebeth and William Friedman.

  zh: 尽管我们有丰富的经验，共同撰写这本书远非一项常规的项目。我们俩都有繁忙的日常工作和演讲日程，这使得我们不得不频繁出差。而且，由于我们之间隔着一片海洋，我们必须远程同步日程，通过
    Skype 和 Zoom 进行沟通，跨越五到九小时的时差，这取决于我们身处世界的哪个角落。虽然我们确实有过两次面对面的会议，但说实话，我们并没有真的利用这些时间来专注于书籍的工作；这段时间更多是用来在图书馆进行研究、采访加密领域人士以及进行其他实地考察。我们甚至第二次访问了位于弗吉尼亚州贝德福德的比尔密码家园，并朝圣般地参观了弗吉尼亚州列克星敦的乔治·C·马歇尔图书馆，研究美国最著名的密码破译夫妇——伊丽莎白和威廉·弗里德曼的历史。
- en: Still, working on our codebreaking book was a rewarding task. We put on paper
    what had occupied us for over two decades, and it felt gratifying to finally give
    these thoughts a home. The book you are holding draws from many sources, including
    other codebreaking books from the pre-computer era, articles in the academic journal
    *Cryptologia*, and Klaus’s hundreds of relevant blog posts, many of which had
    been commented upon by some of the best codebreakers in the world. In addition
    to describing solving methods, we include numerous success stories that show that,
    when it comes to cracking ciphers, devotion, imagination, and luck are sometimes
    just as helpful as expertise and years of experience.

  zh: 尽管如此，撰写我们的破译密码书籍仍然是一项令人满足的任务。我们将占据我们超过二十年的思考写了下来，最终把这些思考定居于纸面上，感觉非常充实。你现在手中的这本书汲取了许多来源，包括来自计算机前时代的其他破译密码书籍、《Cryptologia》学术期刊中的文章，以及克劳斯的数百篇相关博客文章，许多文章已经收到了世界上一些最顶尖的密码破译者的评论。除了描述解决方法外，我们还包括了许多成功案例，证明了在破解密码的过程中，奉献、想象力和运气有时与专业知识和多年的经验一样重要。
- en: As one of our few setbacks, we had to accept that there is much more interesting
    material about codebreaking than we could fit into a book of 500+ pages. With
    the first edition, we had no other choice than (with a great amount of screaming
    and gnashing of teeth) to narrow our scope, which meant that dozens of codebreaking
    methods, unsolved crypto mysteries, cipher challenges, and success stories we
    would have loved to include didn’t make it into the final manuscript. However,
    now that we have an expanded edition, we have put many of them back in!

  zh: 作为我们为数不多的挫折之一，我们不得不接受一个事实，那就是关于密码破译的有趣材料远远超过了我们能够容纳在500多页书籍中的内容。在第一版中，我们别无选择，只能（在大声尖叫和咬牙切齿中）缩小我们的范围，这意味着许多我们原本希望能纳入的密码破译方法、未解的密码谜团、密码挑战以及成功案例未能进入最终稿。然而，现在我们有了扩展版，我们已经将其中许多内容重新加入！
- en: And then, toward the end of our (first) book-writing project, the entire world
    took a bizarre turn when COVID-19 surfaced. It was the start of a crisis that
    affected both of our lives and, of course, the rest of the world. Elonka was in
    San Francisco when this occurred, and the initial “shelter in place” order and
    advice to avoid airports meant she was unable to return to her home in Maryland
    for months. She continued working on the book while perched in a guest room at
    the home of her Bay Area friends, Jon and Beth Leonard. Klaus spent the coronavirus
    time in his apartment in Gelsenkirchen, Germany.

  zh: 然后，在我们（第一本）写书项目的末期，整个世界发生了一个奇怪的转折，COVID-19疫情爆发了。这场危机影响了我们俩的生活，也影响了世界其他地方。疫情发生时，伊隆卡在旧金山，而最初的“居家令”和避免机场的建议让她无法返回位于马里兰州的家中，持续了数月。她在好友乔恩和贝丝·莱昂纳德（Jon
    and Beth Leonard）家中的客房里继续工作。克劳斯则在德国盖尔森基兴的公寓里度过了疫情时期。
- en: 'Surviving the COVID crisis, we successfully turned in our manuscript, and the
    first edition of our book was published in the United Kingdom on December 10,
    2020\. But then, on December 11, we were contacted by our colleague Dave Oranchak,
    who told us that we were going to need to rework the book! As was later reported
    in the news, he and two others had just cracked a legendary unsolved code: the

    in the Southern. Reaching back to the nineteenth century, we’ve added more about
    both the Furlong postcard and the Collinson newspaper ads. We’ve also provided
    updates on the recently exhumed Somerton Man; the message from the World War II
    carrier pigeon that was found in a chimney in 1982; the Dorabella Cipher of 1897;

    is uncertain, so it would seem more useful to formulate a precise action plan
    in the moment, once you know exactly what you’re dealing with. This, indeed, would
    keep things simple—but as highlighted in Chapter 10, you should never underestimate
    the difficulty of making good decisions hurriedly and under intense stress. A
    checklist written ahead of time is essentially a letter to your anxious and tired
    future self, helping you collect your thoughts and make sure you don’t miss anything.
    Checklists are the lifeblood of many critical professions; they feature prominently
    in aviation and in medicine, and they’re common in my own field when responding
    to data breaches and other computer incidents. If they’re useful for pilots and
    brain surgeons, they’ll be useful for you too.

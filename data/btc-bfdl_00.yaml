- en: 'In writing this book, we wanted to explain the concept and potential of Bitcoin
    in a more-or-less timeless manner. Boy, was that hard. It would have been much
    easier to write a book called *The State of Bitcoin Right Now: Please Disregard
    Everything in This Book One Year After Its Publication*. The core technology behind
    Bitcoin, as well as the larger technological infrastructure around it, is rapidly
    evolving as this book goes to press. The debates about the legality, price volatility,
    and merchant adoption of Bitcoin may already be out of date by 2015, and who knows
    how they will sound in 2025.'

  zh: 在写这本书时，我们希望能够以一种或多或少永恒的方式来解释比特币的概念和潜力。哇，真是太难了。如果我们写一本名为《比特币现状：请在本书出版一年后忽略所有内容》的书，那就简单多了。比特币背后的核心技术，以及围绕它的更大技术基础设施，正随着这本书的印刷而迅速发展。关于比特币的合法性、价格波动和商家采用的辩论，到2015年可能已经过时，谁知道它们到2025年会变成什么样呢。
- en: To keep this book relevant for the future, we did our best to focus on those
    aspects of Bitcoin that will remain important forever, and we tried to cover them
    in a way that is fun. We hope you will enjoy our approach to this fascinating
    subject.

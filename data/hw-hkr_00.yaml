- en: When Bill Pollock, founder of No Starch Press, first contacted me with the idea
    of publishing a compilation of my writings, I was skeptical. I didn’t think there
    would be enough material to fill a hundred pages. It seems I was wrong.

  zh: 当《No Starch Press》创始人比尔·波洛克首次联系我，提出出版我写作作品集的想法时，我很怀疑。我当时认为没有足够的素材能填满一百页。看来我错了。
- en: My mother often said, “It doesn’t matter what’s in your head if you can’t tell
    people what’s in it,” and when I was in seventh grade, she enrolled me in an after-school
    essay writing class. I hated the class at the time, but in retrospect, I’m thankful.
    Starting with my college application essays and up to this day, I’ve found the
    ability to organize my thoughts into prose invaluable.

  zh: 我母亲常说：“如果你不能把脑袋里想到的东西告诉别人，那里面有什么都不重要。”在我七年级时，她把我送进了一门课外作文写作班。那时候我讨厌这门课，但回想起来，我很感激。从我的大学申请作文开始，到今天，我发现将思想组织成文字的能力无价之宝。
- en: Most of the material in this book was originally published on my blog, but as
    you’ll soon see, those posts weren’t puff pieces written to drive ad revenue.
    One reason I write is to solidify my own understanding of complicated subjects.
    It’s easy to believe you understand a topic until you try to explain it to someone
    else in a rigorous fashion. Writing is how I distill my intuition into structured
    knowledge; I only write when I find something interesting to write about, and
    then I post it with a CC BY-SA license to encourage others to share it.

  zh: 本书中的大部分内容最初发表于我的博客，但正如你很快会看到的，那些文章并不是为了推动广告收入而写的宣传文章。我写作的一个原因是为了巩固自己对复杂问题的理解。你很容易相信自己理解一个话题，直到你试图以严谨的方式向别人解释它。写作是我将直觉提炼为结构化知识的方式；我只有在发现有趣的事情可以写时才会写，然后我会用CC
    BY-SA许可证发布它，鼓励别人分享。
- en: 'This book includes a selection of my writings on manufacturing, intellectual
    property (with a focus on comparing Western versus Chinese perspectives), open
    hardware, reverse engineering, and biology and bioinformatics. The good editors
    at No Starch Press also curated a couple of interviews I’ve done in the past that
    were particularly informational or insightful. The common thread throughout these
    diverse topics is hardware: how it’s made, the legal frameworks around it, and
    how it’s unmade. And yes, biological systems are hardware.'

  zh: 本书包括我关于制造业、知识产权（重点比较西方与中国的视角）、开放硬件、逆向工程、生物学和生物信息学的写作选集。《No Starch Press》的优秀编辑们还精心策划了我过去进行的一些采访，特别是那些信息丰富或富有洞察力的采访。这些多样话题之间的共同线索是硬件：它是如何制造的，围绕它的法律框架，以及它是如何被拆解的。没错，生物系统也是硬件。
- en: I’ve always gravitated toward hardware because while I’m not particularly gifted
    when it comes to abstract thought (hence the need to write to organize my thoughts),
    I am pretty good with my hands. I have a much better chance of understanding things
    that I can see with my own two eyes.

  zh: 我一直倾向于硬件，因为虽然我在抽象思维方面并不特别天赋（因此需要写作来整理我的思路），但我在动手方面相当不错。我更有可能理解那些我能用自己眼睛看到的事物。
- en: My entire understanding of the world has always been built on a series of simple,
    physical experiences, starting from when I stacked blocks and knocked them over
    as a child. This book shares some of my more recent experiences. I hope that by
    reading them, you will gain a deeper understanding of the world of hardware, without
    having to spend decades stacking blocks and knocking them over.

  zh: 我对世界的理解一直建立在一系列简单的物理体验之上，从我小时候堆积积木并将其推倒开始。本书分享了我一些最近的经历。我希望通过阅读这些经历，你能够更深入地理解硬件的世界，而无需花费几十年堆积积木并将其推倒。

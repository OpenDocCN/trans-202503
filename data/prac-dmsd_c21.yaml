  zh: 正如第四章所讨论的，公众对核灾难的看法是相当错误的。原子弹产生的是强烈但持续时间较短的辐射降尘，对于能够在一个有适当物资的适度避难地点生存几周的人来说，前景应该相对较好。反应堆熔毁则可能释放出更长时间存在的污染，覆盖广泛的土地——但除了损坏反应堆周围的区域，污染通常是低级的，尽管会稍微增加某些疾病的发病率，但对大多数居民没有明显和立即的影响。换句话说，暴露更多的是一个大规模健康政策问题，而不是严重的个人风险。
- en: The cinematic portrayal of the health effects of radiation exposure is fairly
    lopsided too. Receiving a lethal dose would be a terrible way to go, but developing
    radiation sickness—with its hallmark symptoms such as vomiting and hair loss—isn’t
    a sure sign of impending death. The received dose of radiation is often measured
    in units called *sieverts* *(Sv)*;^([*](#c21-footnote-1)) an acute dose of around
    1 Sv is enough to cause all the usual symptoms, but the vast majority of individuals
    would be back on their feet in a matter of days. It’s true that their odds of
    dying of cancer later in life would go up by several percentage points,^([8](b02.xhtml#c21-endnote-8))
    but that’s hardly a life-altering prospect, given that our lifetime odds of getting
    cancer already hover around 40 percent.^([9](b02.xhtml#c21-endnote-9))

  zh: 电影中对辐射暴露健康影响的描绘也相当片面。接受致命剂量辐射将是一个可怕的死法，但发展辐射病——其典型症状如呕吐和脱发——并不意味着即将死亡。接收到的辐射剂量通常用*西弗（sieverts）*（*Sv*）来衡量；^([*](#c21-footnote-1))
    一个大约1 Sv的急性剂量足以引起所有常见的症状，但绝大多数人在几天内就能恢复正常。确实，他们晚年死于癌症的几率会增加几个百分点，^([8](b02.xhtml#c21-endnote-8))
    但考虑到我们一生中罹患癌症的几率已经接近40％，这并不是一个生活改变的前景。^([9](b02.xhtml#c21-endnote-9))
- en: Of course, even if the danger is overblown, the best approach is to get out
    of harm’s way. But when evacuation is impractical or unsafe, the next best strategy
    is to shelter in a sealed home or other structure where you can stay for a longer
    while. In anticipation of nuclear fallout, the priority is to put as much distance
    and mass as possible between yourself and the outside world—especially lawns,
    roofs, and other horizontal surfaces where highly radioactive dust may accumulate.

  zh: 当然，即使危险被夸大了，最好的方法还是避开危险。但当撤离不现实或不安全时，下一步最佳的策略是待在一个密封的家或其他结构内，尽可能长时间地待在里面。为了应对核辐射的降尘，首要任务是尽可能地在自己与外界之间增加距离和质量——尤其是草坪、屋顶和其他水平表面，这些地方可能积聚大量的高辐射尘埃。
- en: 'Regrettably, most wooden-frame single-family homes offer fairly meager protection
    in this regard. Hiding in the basement or moving to the middle floor of a multistory
    structure may be the best bet. If this isn’t an option, any dense material can
    offer shielding. In a pinch, a fort made out of mattresses or heavy furniture,
    and positioned far from the outer walls of the house, should do the trick. The
    goal is simple: maximize the odds that the photons of penetrating gamma radiation
    will collide with other matter before reaching you.'

  zh: 遗憾的是，大多数木框单体住宅在这方面提供的保护相当有限。躲进地下室或移到多层结构的中间楼层可能是最好的选择。如果这不是一个选项，任何密集的材料都可以提供屏蔽。在紧急情况下，用床垫或重家具建造一个堡垒，并把它放在远离房屋外墙的位置，应该能够起到作用。目标很简单：最大限度地增加穿透性伽马辐射的光子在到达你之前与其他物质碰撞的几率。
- en: As with other scenarios discussed in this chapter, relatively little can be
    gained from donning hazmat suits or gas masks while indoors. These articles are
    essentially transparent to gamma radiation, and their main utility is that they
    can be used to prevent you from inhaling radioactive dust or tracking it into
    the home after venturing outside. Ideally, such excursions should be avoided for
    as long as possible. Having said that, when it’s time to head out, this protective
    gear can help, along with a sensible decontamination protocol upon your return.

  zh: 与本章讨论的其他情况一样，在室内穿戴防护服或防毒面具并不能带来太多好处。这些物品对伽马辐射几乎是透明的，它们的主要作用是防止你吸入放射性尘埃，或在外出后将其带回家。理想情况下，应尽可能长时间避免外出。话虽如此，当需要外出时，这些防护装备可以派上用场，并且回家后进行合理的去污处理也很重要。
- en: The radioactivity of the fallout should decrease fairly quickly to levels that
    pose no immediate hazard when walking around. The lingering radionuclides would
    still be dangerous to ingest or inhale, however, so care would need to be exercised
    when drinking, eating, or disturbing dirt. Therefore, it’s best to live off existing
    supplies for as long as possible; past that point, simple precautions can minimize
    harm. For example, streams and rivers should become safe fairly quickly, but bodies
    of standing, shallow water would best be avoided for a while. As for agriculture,
    cultivation of crops can resume, but in more contaminated regions, it would be
    desirable to remove several inches of topsoil first.

  zh: 落尘的放射性应该会迅速减少到一个不会对四处行走造成直接危险的水平。然而，残留的放射性核素仍然可能对摄入或吸入构成危险，因此在饮水、进食或扰动泥土时需要小心。因此，最好尽可能长时间依赖现有的物资；超出这个时间点后，采取简单的预防措施可以最大限度地减少伤害。例如，溪流和河流应该很快变得安全，但应尽量避免接触静止的浅水体。至于农业，作物种植可以恢复，但在更为污染的地区，最好先去除几英寸的表土。
- en: A *Geiger counter* is the quintessential element of post-apocalyptic chic—and
    in principle, these meters can offer valuable insights when communications are
    shot. The problem is that most of the low-cost units available on the internet
    are toys. Their detectors quickly become saturated and begin returning deceptively
    low readings past a certain very modest threshold. The wide-range models useful
    in life-and-death situations are more expensive. Thankfully, many fire departments
    and other local government agencies stocked up on such gear in the wake of 9/11
    and are now liquidating their inventories on the cheap. With a bit of patience,
    high-quality units such as an NRC ADM-300 or a Canberra MRAD113 can be found on
    eBay for a good price. Analog Civil Defense units from the 1960s are popular too,
    but they’re fairly ancient; without careful testing and calibration, their performance
    is hard to predict.

- en: The most basic measurement mode of a Geiger counter is to display the dose rate,
    measured in sieverts per hour (Sv/hr); as noted earlier, roentgens per hour (R/hr)
    may be encountered too. It’s believed that the effects of radiation are roughly
    cumulative, so the dose rate is telling you the speed with which your body might
    be accumulating radiation injury. To illustrate, you can reach the symptomatic
    dose of 1 Sv by being subjected to 200 mSv/hr for five hours, or to 500 mSv/hr
    for two hours. For comparison, the normal background dose rate is about six orders
    of magnitude lower—typically somewhere between 0.1 and 0.5 µSv/hr, depending on
    factors such as soil composition and altitude.

  zh: 盖革计数器最基本的测量模式是显示剂量率，单位为西弗每小时（Sv/hr）；如前所述，也可能遇到每小时伦琴（R/hr）。人们认为放射线的影响大致是累积性的，因此剂量率告诉你的是你体内辐射伤害的积累速度。举个例子，你可以通过在200
    mSv/hr的辐射强度下待五小时，或在500 mSv/hr的辐射强度下待两小时，达到1 Sv的症状性剂量。作为对比，正常的背景剂量率大约低六个数量级——通常在0.1到0.5
    µSv/hr之间，具体取决于土壤成分和海拔等因素。
- en: The first threshold for a cumulative dose resulting in apparent health effects
    is about 100 mSv. At that point, your lifetime risk of developing cancer ticks
    up about one-half of a percentage point; a handful of Fukushima residents are
    believed to have reached this point. As mentioned earlier, at a dose of about
    1 Sv, mild radiation sickness is often present, and the lifetime cancer odds go
    up about 6 percentage points; some residents of Chernobyl are believed to have
    received this much. At the considerably higher dose of 5 Sv, the odds of death
    are around 50 percent, and the survivors typically get all kinds of tumors down
    the line. Finally, doses over 10 Sv are almost invariably lethal; they have been
    seen among some of the first responders at Chernobyl.

    options ahead of exposure too—about the most valuable intervention is iodine pills
    that can block the uptake of radioactive iodine-131 by the thyroid. Such pills
    are available over the counter under brand names such as iOSAT and can be cheaply
    included in a survival kit. Far less convincingly, several dietary supplements

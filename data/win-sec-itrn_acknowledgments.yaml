- en: Few books are written in complete isolation, and this one certainly doesn’t
    break that mold. I’d like to take the opportunity to thank some of the many people
    who have contributed to making this tome a reality. I apologize to anyone I’ve
    forgotten.

  zh: 很少有书籍是在完全孤立的情况下写成的，而这本书当然也不例外。我想借此机会感谢一些为这本巨著的实现做出贡献的人们。对于那些我忘记提到的人，我深感抱歉。
- en: I must start by acknowledging the contribution of my wife, Huayi, who cheers
    me up when I’m down and kicks me (metaphorically) when I’m being lazy. Without
    her by my side, the past few years would have been much less agreeable. The rest
    of my family are just as important; without them, my life would be so very different.

  zh: 我必须首先感谢我的妻子 Huayi，她在我情绪低落时鼓励我，在我懒散时（比喻性地）激励我。如果没有她在我身边，过去的几年将会少了许多美好的回忆。我的其他家人同样重要；没有他们，我的生活将完全不同。
- en: Next, I’d like to thank my technical reviewer, Lee Holmes, who has made the
    review a valuable experience, teaching me many PowerShell tricks I didn’t know
    existed and providing important feedback on the structure and content.

- en: I’m not the only person doing significant research on Windows. While there are
    far too many to list here, I’d like to acknowledge the following people who have
    made important contributions to my work. First is Alex Ionescu, well-known Windows
    internals guru and my sometimes collaborator (or competitor), who always seems
    to know some weird bit of operating system esoterica. Then there are the many
    practitioners of Windows enterprise security research and testing, such as Lee
    Christensen, Will Schroeder, and Nick Landers. They’ve been important sounding
    boards for my understanding of software like Active Directory and Kerberos and
    have actively tested and contributed to my tooling projects.

  zh: 我并不是唯一在 Windows 方面做出重要研究的人。虽然这里列举不完，但我还是想感谢以下几位对我的工作做出重要贡献的人。首先是 Alex Ionescu，这位著名的
    Windows 内部专家和我有时的合作伙伴（或竞争对手），他似乎总是知道一些操作系统方面的奇怪细节。接下来是许多从事 Windows 企业安全研究和测试的专家们，比如
    Lee Christensen、Will Schroeder 和 Nick Landers。他们在我理解像 Active Directory 和 Kerberos
    这样的软件时，提供了宝贵的意见，并积极测试和贡献了我的工具项目。
- en: I’d be remiss not to mention the amazing researchers from my more formative
    years, especially Pete and Rich; you know who you are. Also, I’d like to thank
    Rob and his team for looking at early drafts of my book’s chapters and providing
    valuable feedback.

- en: My relationship with Microsoft has had its ups and downs. That said, I’d like
    to thank many of its current and former employees who have helped me along the
    way. This includes Katie Moussouris, who was instrumental in convincing me that
    it pays to find bugs in Microsoft products. Without her friendship and contributions,
    I doubt I’d be as successful as I am today. Then there’s Nate Warfield, who for
    many years was my point of contact at the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC),
    where he shielded me from much of the company’s party politics and ensured the
    bugs I reported got fixed in a timely manner. Finally, I’d like to thank current
    MSRC representatives, including Nic Fillingham and Stephanie Calabrese, for helping
    me when I need to contact someone deep inside the beast, and for providing me
    with swag.

  zh: 我和微软的关系起伏不定。尽管如此，我还是要感谢许多现任和前任的微软员工，他们在这过程中帮助了我。包括 Katie Moussouris，她在说服我发现微软产品中的
    bug 上发挥了重要作用。如果没有她的友谊和贡献，我怀疑我今天会有这么大的成功。接下来是 Nate Warfield，多年来他一直是我在微软安全响应中心（MSRC）的联系人，在那里他为我挡住了许多公司内部的政治纷争，并确保我报告的漏洞及时被修复。最后，我要感谢现任
    MSRC 的代表们，包括 Nic Fillingham 和 Stephanie Calabrese，他们在我需要联系微软内部人员时提供了帮助，并为我提供了纪念品。
- en: 'Special thanks to my Google colleagues, who support me in making and breaking
    things on Windows. This includes the entirety of the current Google Project Zero
    team and its alumni: the best set of security researchers you’ll likely ever find
    in a single room, or even two. Then there’s Will Harris, my friend and colleague
    on the Chromium Windows sandbox team, who asked me many of the questions about
    Windows security on which this book is based. Finally, thanks to Heather Adkins,
    who was instrumental in my being allowed to write a book of this nature while
    keeping a job at Google.'

  zh: 特别感谢我的Google同事们，他们在我处理和破解Windows系统的问题时给予了我支持。这包括当前的Google Project Zero团队及其校友们：你可能在一间甚至两间房间里也找不到比他们更出色的安全研究人员。还有**威尔·哈里斯**，他是我的朋友，也是Chromium
    Windows沙盒团队的同事，他向我提出了许多本书关于Windows安全的核心问题。最后，感谢**希瑟·阿德金斯**，她在我能够写这样一本书的过程中发挥了重要作用，同时还保留了我在Google的工作。
- en: 'I’d also like to thank everyone at No Starch Press who has worked on this book
    and been patient with me: especially Alex Freed, my longtime editor, who unfortunately
    left before this book was published, and Frances Saux, who became my new editor
    after Alex’s departure and pulled this book, kicking and screaming, to completion.
    Finally, I must thank Bill Pollock, who is a good friend and always has amazing
    advice on the book writing process, as well as the latest recommendations for
    incredible restaurants.'

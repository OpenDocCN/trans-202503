- en: In mid-2009, as the world was just escaping the most severe economic meltdown
    since the 1930s, I was escaping university with an undergraduate liberal arts
    degree and not a single prospect for gainful employment. Rather than take my chances
    in the dreadful job market, I decided to spend a little more time (and a lot more
    money) on my education. Facing the difficult reality that a university degree
    could not guarantee a job, I diligently cross-referenced my various interests
    against their occupational prospects to refocus my career path in a more dependable
    and less ambiguous direction. I settled on civil engineering, a subject about
    which I knew almost nothing but that seemed both exciting and responsible. Incredibly,
    I was accepted into my top choice for graduate school and started my studies that
    fall.

  zh: 2009年中，当全球刚刚摆脱自上世纪30年代以来最严重的经济衰退时，我却带着一张本科文科文凭走出大学，却没有任何有前景的工作机会。与其在可怕的就业市场中碰运气，我决定花更多的时间（和更多的钱）继续深造。面对大学学位无法保证找到工作的严峻现实，我认真对比了我各项兴趣与其职业前景，重新调整了我的职业路径，使其更加稳定、明确。我选择了土木工程这个几乎一无所知但又既令人兴奋又充满责任感的学科。令我惊讶的是，我被我的首选研究生院录取，并于那个秋季开始了我的研究生学习。
- en: Once I had worked through the basic math and science classes required to catch
    up to my graduate-level classmates, I began the engineering coursework. I have
    always been generally curious about science, technology, and how things work.
    Still, nothing could have prepared me for the remarkable transformation of perspective
    I would receive during the rest of my studies. Structural design classes had me
    staring at every beam and column to be spotted in each new building I visited.
    Circuits labs pointed out the details and complexities of electric transmission
    lines and substations. Stormwater engineering lectures compelled me to notice
    every drain, manhole, channel, and detention basin while biking or driving around
    town. Each and every class was like turning on a lamp to illuminate some innocuous
    part of the constructed environment that I had never noticed before. I was captivated.

  zh: 一旦我完成了追赶研究生同学所需的基础数学和科学课程，我便开始了工程学的课程。我一直对科学、技术以及事物的运作方式充满好奇。然而，没有任何东西能让我为在接下来的学习过程中获得的视角转变做准备。结构设计课程让我开始关注每一栋新建建筑中可见的每根梁和柱。电路实验室让我注意到电力传输线和变电站的细节与复杂性。雨水工程讲座促使我在骑车或开车穿行市区时注意到每一个排水口、检查井、渠道和滞洪池。每一门课就像是点亮了一盏灯，照亮了我以前从未注意过的建筑环境中的某个不起眼的部分。我被深深吸引住了。
- en: I finished my degree not only with a job but also with an entirely new way of
    looking at the world. It didn’t take long for that enthusiasm and excitement about
    infrastructure to overflow into my personal life, including my hobby YouTube channel.
    What started as a way to share my woodworking projects with other makers and craftspeople
    slowly turned into an outlet for introducing topics in engineering to the world.
    Now I produce educational videos full-time, and *Practical Engineering* has millions
    of viewers each month.

  zh: 我不仅顺利完成了学位，而且还获得了一种全新的看待世界的方式。对基础设施的热情和兴奋很快溢出了我的个人生活，包括我的爱好 YouTube 频道。最初，那个频道只是我分享木工项目与其他创客和工匠的方式，但它逐渐演变成了一个向世界介绍工程学话题的渠道。现在，我全职制作教育视频，*实用工程*每月吸引着数百万观众。
- en: Even the most unexceptional parts of the built environment are monuments to
    the solutions to hundreds of practical engineering problems. Understanding even
    a small subset of those challenges and their resolutions had the power to instill
    astonishment and wonder in me, and I never stopped feeling that way. Now my entire
    life is essentially a treasure hunt for all the interesting little details of
    the constructed world. My spontaneous stops at each dam and bridge for a photograph
    or a better look drive my wife a little crazy on road trips. I regularly lose
    my train of thought on walks when noticing some new or different piece of infrastructure.
    And there is a tiny part of my brain that is dedicated—no matter where I am or
    what I’m doing—to following the path that stormwater will take as it runs off
    along the ground. Engineering opened my eyes to the infrastructure that surrounds
    and supports our modern lives. If any of that eagerness comes across in this book,
    I have succeeded.

  zh: 即使是最普通的建筑环境部分，也是解决数百个实际工程问题的纪念碑。即使是其中一小部分挑战及其解决方案，也能让我感到震惊和惊奇，我从未停止过这种感觉。现在，我的整个生活基本上是一场寻找建筑世界中所有有趣小细节的寻宝之旅。我在每座大坝和桥梁前随意停车拍照或仔细观察，常常让我的妻子在公路旅行中有些抓狂。每当在散步时注意到某个新或不同的基础设施，我常常会丢失思绪。我的大脑里有一个小部分，始终在关注——无论我身处何地或正在做什么——暴雨径流沿着地面流动的路径。工程学让我睁开眼睛看到了环绕并支持我们现代生活的基础设施。如果这些热情在本书中有所传达，那么我就算是成功了。
- en: This is not a comprehensive field guide. Infrastructure takes a myriad of shapes
    and forms that vary around the world. This book focuses on the United States,
    but constructed works can look quite different even between states, counties,
    and cities. It wouldn’t be practical to try to document them all. Plus, it would
    ruin the fun. Part of the joy of “infrastructure spotting” is using your detective
    skills to deduce the purpose of random bits and bobs as you come across them.
    I hope what follows can ignite that joy and further your journey as an enthusiastic
    beholder of the constructed environment.

  zh: 这不是一本全面的现场指南。基础设施有各种各样的形式，世界各地都有不同。这本书主要关注美国，但即使是在不同的州、县和城市，建筑作品也可能大相径庭。试图记录所有这些是不现实的。而且，这样做会破坏乐趣。“基础设施观察”其中的乐趣之一，就是运用侦探技能推测随机出现的物品的用途。我希望接下来的内容能点燃这种乐趣，并进一步推动你成为一名热情的建筑环境观察者。

    sexual advances from her boss simply because the alternative is worse: unemployment
    and no way to make the rent. The same story is then retold from the perspective

    covering small repairs out of pocket—can save thousands in insurance premiums

  zh: 当然，财务准备也包括谨慎对待新的信用义务，以及积极管理旧的债务。许多人希望他们的房子能够体现自己的职业成就，但除非你已经有了一个充足的安全网，否则房贷或租约占据收入超过15%的部分是一个高风险交易，而超过30%几乎可以肯定是一个糟糕的主意，至少在财务可持续性规划方面如此。如果有疑虑，最好把目标定得低一点。当财务状况发生变化时，向上交易比向下调整要容易得多，而且不会令人气馁。

  zh: 知道何时停手
- en: As hinted in Chapter 2, there’s something to be said about diminishing returns
    in emergency planning. A dry spell in the job market that lasts three months is
    far more likely than one that lasts three years; saving for the former is eminently
    achievable and unquestionably beneficial, while saving for the latter may take
    a decade or more without ever proving to be necessary. On the flip side, economic
    downturns are some of the longer-lasting hardships worth planning for, and the
    unique beauty of investing your money into a savings fund instead of, for example,
    a pallet of canned cheese, is that the former can easily be repurposed as circumstances
    change. A surplus portion of the rainy-day fund can be used to self-finance larger
    purchases without paying a penny in credit card interest, to bootstrap a business,
    or to plan for early retirement.

  zh: 正如第二章所暗示的，紧急准备中的递减效应也有其道理。持续三个月的就业市场干旱远比持续三年的干旱更为可能；为前者储蓄是完全可实现且无疑有益的，而为后者储蓄可能需要十年或更长时间，甚至可能永远不会成为必要的事情。另一方面，经济衰退是一些值得规划的长期困境，而将资金投资到储蓄基金中的独特优势（与例如一堆罐装奶酪相比）在于，前者可以根据情况变化灵活调整用途。多余的紧急基金部分可以用来自我融资较大的购买，而无需支付一分钱的信用卡利息，用来启动业务，或者规划提前退休。
- en: In principle, around three months’ worth of post-tax earnings is probably a
    solid initial goal, while six months’ worth offers a robust cushion against short-
    and medium-term disasters of all sorts. Recessions sometimes last longer, but
    even in a deep crisis, six months can be plenty of time to scale down expenses,
    find a new line of work, or regroup in other ways.

  zh: 从原则上讲，大约三个月的税后收入可能是一个可靠的初步目标，而六个月的收入则能提供一个强有力的缓冲，抵御各种短期和中期的灾难。经济衰退有时会持续更长时间，但即使在严重危机中，六个月也足够时间缩减开支、寻找新的工作或以其他方式重新组织。
- en: At the same time, there’s very little reason to stop at the six-month mark.
    As your savings grow, a strong positive reinforcement mechanism usually develops
    on its own. You begin to appreciate the long-term payoff of fiscal restraint,
    and become more deliberate when evaluating the pros and cons of impulse buys.
    The same usually can’t be said about people who stumble upon riches by luck. Without
    this mental framework, many lottery winners and heirs of wealthy families slide
    into financial ruin, addiction, or worse. Living below your means might not make
    you a millionaire the way winning the lottery might, but the payoff may be even
    better, no matter how the stars align.

  zh: 与此同时，几乎没有理由在六个月后就停止。当你的储蓄增长时，通常会自然形成强大的正向强化机制。你开始意识到财务克制的长期回报，并在评估冲动购买的利弊时变得更加慎重。通常，靠运气获得财富的人则无法做到这一点。没有这种心理框架，许多中彩票的幸运儿和富家继承人最终会陷入财务破产、上瘾，甚至更糟。生活在自己经济水平之下可能不会像中彩票那样让你成为百万富翁，但无论星辰如何排列，回报可能会更好。

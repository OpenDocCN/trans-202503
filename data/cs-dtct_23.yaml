- en: '“Data structures,” explained Notation, apparently on autopilot. “They’re like
    regular queues: you enqueue and dequeue items. But they also require each item

- en: “I know what priority queues are,” said the captain. “We use them for storing
    the list of noise complaints. The louder noises get higher priority, so we are
    always addressing the worst cases first. I heard they use them for smell complaints

    one off the priority queue. We’ll always get the next best lead.”

- en: Frank sighed and shook his head. He knew the captain well enough to see how
    this was going to go. The captain excelled at his own brand of teaching moments.

    the solution. He had to hand it to her—the idea of using priority queues for tracking

- en: Note that there are no guarantees that the data will be sorted within the priority
    queue, only that it is extracted in order. As you’ll see in later lectures, data
    structures called *heaps* are an efficient way of implementing priority queues
    that do *not* keep the data in fully sorted order.

  zh: 请注意，不能保证数据在优先级队列内部会被排序，只能保证按顺序提取。正如你将在后续讲座中看到的，称为*堆*的数据结构是实现优先级队列的一种高效方式，它不会保持数据完全排序。
- en: The capital’s station uses a variety of priority functions. As you might expect,
    the queue most hotly debated is the vacation priority queue. This queue is ordered
    solely by the officer’s number of unused vacation days. Despite previous requests,
    no additional priority is given for the niceness of the vacation spot. Upcoming
    trips to glaciers, beaches, and swamps are treated equally. Instead, the queue
    prioritizes based on one measure of fairness. It helps to ensure that the next
    officer to go on vacation is the one who’s taken the fewest vacation days this
    year.

  zh: 首都的车站使用各种优先级功能。正如你所预料的那样，最受争议的队列是度假优先级队列。这个队列仅按照官员未使用的假期天数排序。尽管之前有过请求，但并没有为度假地点的美好程度提供额外的优先级。即将到来的前往冰川、海滩和沼泽的旅行被同等对待。相反，队列根据公平度量来确定优先级。这有助于确保下一个休假的官员是今年休假天数最少的那个。

- en: In the mid-1980s, I landed my first software development job, which introduced
    me to the *relational database management system* *(RDBMS)*, a system to store
    and retrieve data from a database. The concept has been around since 1970, when
    E.F. Codd published his famous paper introducing the relational model. The term
    *relational* refers to the fact that the data is stored in a grid of rows and
    columns, otherwise known as a table.

- en: At the time I started out, commercial database systems weren’t widely available.
    In fact, I didn’t know anybody else who was using one. The RDBMS I used was imperfect,
    with no graphical interface and a command line interface that periodically crashed
    for no apparent reason. Since the World Wide Web had yet to be invented, there
    were no websites I could turn to for help, so I had no choice but to start my
    system back up and hope for the best.

- en: Still, the idea was pretty cool. I saved large amounts of data in tables I created
    based on the nature of the information I wanted to store. I defined table columns,
    loaded data into the tables from files, and queried that data with *Structured
    Query Language (SQL)*, a language for interacting with databases that allowed
    me to add, change, and delete multiple rows of data in a snap. I could manage
    an entire company’s data using this technology!

- en: Today, relational database management systems are ubiquitous and, thankfully,
    far more stable and advanced than the clunkers I used in the ’80s. SQL has also
    vastly improved. The focus of this book is MySQL, which has become the most popular
    open source RDBMS in the world since its creation in 1995.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book will teach you to use MySQL using its Community Server (also known
    as the Community Edition), which is free to use and has the features most people
    need. There are also paid versions of MySQL, including the Enterprise Edition,
    that come with extra features and capabilities. All editions run on a wide variety
    of operating systems, such as Linux, Windows, macOS, and even the cloud, and have
    a robust set of features and tools.

- en: Throughout this book, you’ll explore the most useful parts of MySQL development,
    as well as insights I’ve picked up over the years. We’ll cover how to write SQL
    statements; create tables, functions, triggers, and views; and ensure the integrity
    of your data. In the last three chapters, you’ll see how to use MySQL in the real
    world through hands-on projects.

    MySQL database administrators (DBAs) may want to look elsewhere. While I occasionally
    wander into a topic of interest to a DBA (like granting permissions on tables),
    I don’t delve into server setup, storage capacity, backup, recovery, or most other
    DBA-related issues.

- en: Learning SQL is an important part of using MySQL. SQL allows you to store, modify,
    and delete data from your databases, as well as create and remove tables, query
    your data, and much more.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Relational database management systems other than MySQL, including Oracle, Microsoft
    SQL Server, and PostgreSQL, also use SQL. In theory, the SQL used in these systems
    is standardized according to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
    specifications. In practice, however, there are some differences among the database
    systems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each database system comes with its own extension of SQL. For example, Oracle
    provides a procedural extension of SQL called Procedural Language/SQL (PL/SQL).
    Microsoft SQL Server comes with Transact-SQL (T-SQL). PostgreSQL comes with Procedural
    Language/PostgreSQL (PL/pgSQL). MySQL doesn’t have a fancy name for its extension;
    it’s simply called the MySQL stored program language. These SQL extensions all
    use different syntaxes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Database systems created these extensions because SQL is a *non-procedural*
    language, meaning it’s great for retrieving and storing data to or from a database,
    but it isn’t designed to be a procedural programming language like Java or Python
    that allows us to use `if...then` logic or `while` loops, for example. The database
    procedural extensions add that functionality.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, while much of the SQL knowledge you learn from this book will be
    transferable to other database systems, some of the syntax may require tweaking
    if you want to run your queries with a database system other than MySQL.

    The scripts for Chapters [2](c02.xhtml)–[18](c18.xhtml) follow the naming convention
    *chapter_X.sql*, where *X* is the chapter number. Chapters [15](c15.xhtml) and
    [16](c16.xhtml) have additional scripts in folders named *chapter_15* and *chapter_16*.

    chapter. The script also contains example code and answers for the exercises.
    I recommend attempting the exercises yourself, but feel free to use this resource
    if you get stuck or want to check your answers.

    paste the commands into your environment using a tool like MySQL Workbench or
    the MySQL command line client (these tools are discussed in [Chapter 1](c01.xhtml)).
    Alternatively, you can download the scripts to your computer. To do this, navigate
    to the GitHub repository and click the green **Code** button. Choose the **Download
    ZIP** option to download the scripts as a ZIP file.

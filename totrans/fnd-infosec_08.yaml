    data. People can gather information about individuals and organizations more quickly
    today than ever before. A staggering wealth of information exists in online databases,
    public records, and social media sites, and in many cases, this data is free for
    the taking. Many people post detailed personal information regarding their day-to-day
    activities for the entire world to see.

    they can use it to conduct sophisticated attacks. If an attacker called a company
    and flat-out asked for a report containing sensitive sales data, the person on
    the other end would likely refuse. On the other hand, if an attacker used social
    engineering techniques by calling in a panicked voice and asked for a copy of
    the latest TPS-13 report from the sales directory on the SalesCom server because
    they have a meeting with Mr. Kurosawa in 15 minutes and their laptop just crashed,
    they’re more likely to succeed. (This is a social engineering attack known as
    pretexting. I’ll discuss it in more detail later in this chapter.)

    *human intelligence (HUMINT)* is data gathered by talking to people. HUMINT data
    might include personal observations, people’s schedules, sensitive information,
    or any of a number of other similar items. You can collect HUMINT with hostile
    techniques such as torture or by tricking participants with subtle scams. Security
    professionals focus on the latter.

    attacks. You could observe the traffic going in and out of an office building
    and notice that the office receives frequent package deliveries and that a shift
    change happens at 8 AM every morning, causing many people to enter and exit the
    building at the same time. You’d have a much better chance of entering the facility
    in an unauthorized manner during this busy time, while dressed in a familiar delivery
    uniform.

    names of people and their positions. OSINT is one of the primary sources of information

    otherwise consider sensitive, including office and data center locations, network
    or security infrastructure details, and the software in use. Recruiters might
    consider it necessary to post this information for the hiring process, but attackers
    can also use it to plan attacks or add focus to future surveillance efforts.

    you’ve just dramatically reduced the number of variables you must consider when
    planning attacks against the company. If you collect additional information about
    the location and members of their information security team, you might also be
    able to predict the skill level and timing of any responses to your attack, making
    your attack more effective.

    and may provide a richer source for this type of information.

    person. Using a fake identity, they create believable scenarios that convince
    their targets to give up sensitive information or perform actions they wouldn’t
    normally do for strangers.
  prefs: []

    medium. Direct interactions require a heightened level of attention to details
    such as body language, while indirect encounters, such as those conducted over
    the phone or through email, require a stronger focus on verbal mannerisms. Both
    types require good communication and psychological skills, specialized knowledge,
    and a quick mind.

    cause to believe that they’re entitled to the information or access for which
    they’re asking—or, for that matter, that they already have it—their chances of

    cautious of unsolicited emails from their banks or other websites. In general,
    phishing attacks rely on a lack of attention to detail on the recipient’s part,
    and their rate of success remains low.
  prefs: []

    come from someone the target would trust, such as human resources staff, a manager,
    the corporate IT support team, a peer, or a friend.

    they’ll disguise any malicious links present. If the attack exists to steal credentials
    for a site or service, the attacker may even use the freshly stolen credentials
    to log the target into the real site, leaving no error message or broken session

- en: You should set rules for when and how employees can use personal equipment in
    the workplace. Typically, you might allow them to use it at the *border* of the
    organization’s network; that means you’d let them bring their laptops to work
    and attach them to a guest wireless network but not to the same network as the
    company’s production systems.

- en: A *clean desk policy* states that sensitive information shouldn’t be left unattended
    on a desk for any significant period of time, such as overnight or during a lunch
    break. When introducing such a policy, you should also discuss how to properly
    dispose of sensitive data stored on physical media, such as paper or tape, by
    using shred bins, data destruction services, and media shredders.

    you need to communicate them effectively. You probably won’t actually educate
    them if you just send an email to all users containing a link to a lengthy policy
    and then have them attest to having read it. Instead, you might try condensing
    the most critical part of your policy into a kind of crib notes or highlights
    reel to make sure users retain the key points.

    engaging. For instance, if you have an hour allotted to conducting security awareness
    training for newly hired employees, you might shorten your lecture portion to
    30 minutes and then spend the second half of the time conducting an interactive
    quiz show–style game on the material you just covered. Once you’ve added an element
    of competition by dividing the class into teams and adding an incentive (such
    as prizes for the winners), you’ll have created a more interesting environment.

    mugs, and newsletters. If you present the information through repeated and varied
    avenues, you’re more likely to educate users in the long term.

    of information security: the security issues that you can’t address by technical
    means alone. Whether because of mere carelessness or targeted social engineering
    attacks, the people who staff your organizations pose a security challenge that
    you can’t directly address with technical controls.'

- en: I discussed types of social engineering attacks, and you saw how attackers put
    these techniques to use to solicit information or coerce unauthorized actions
    from people in your organizations. I also covered how to build security awareness
    and training programs. Common issues to discuss with users include protecting
    passwords, recognizing social engineering attacks and malware, using networks
    and personal equipment safely, and adhering to a clean desk policy. If you make
    your security awareness and training programs engaging, this information is more
    likely to stick with users over time.

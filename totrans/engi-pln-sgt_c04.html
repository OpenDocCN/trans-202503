<h2 id="h1-502321c04-0001">Introduction</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">For all its natural beauty, the Earth often creates difficulties in getting around. In fact, many of the most magnificent of Earth’s features are also the most challenging to traverse. Rivers and mountains aren’t conducive to roadways, railways, or other corridors along the ground’s surface. When the topography is too wet, steep, treacherous, or prone to disaster, the only way forward is up or down. At canyons, valleys, and rivers, our roadways break free from the earth using bridges. And at hills, mountains, and shallow waterways, they bore right through to the other side. Perhaps because these structures solve such a grand but singular problem—creating a path to the other side—bridges and tunnels are among the most celebrated human achievements and full of fascinating engineering details. They are almost always custom-designed for a specific location, conforming to the local topography, geology, and hydrology (not to mention regional architectural preferences and styles). So, each bridge and tunnel is distinct with its own individual character. Because of their size and importance, these structures often reflect that character outward, becoming a symbol of the places they connect. </p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c04-0002"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_97" title="97"/>Types of Bridges</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Much of the infrastructure we rely on day to day is not necessarily picturesque. We certainly could build exquisite electrical transmission lines or stunning sanitary sewers, but we rarely want to bear the cost. Bridges are different, though. It seems that humanity decided if we must clutter up the most scenic parts of the landscape with structures, we should at least give them some charm. That’s not to say ugly bridges don’t exist in the world, but the physical appearance of bridges is often a significant consideration during their design. To an enthusiast of constructed works, many are downright breathtaking. There are so many ways to span a gap, all singular in function but remarkably different in form. No matter how it’s accomplished, there is something magical about a structure that can support substantial loads with nothing underneath.</p>
<p>One of the simplest structural crossings is the <span class="SmallCaps">beam bridge</span>. It consists of one or more beams (often called <span class="SmallCaps">girders</span>) resting on <span class="SmallCaps">piers</span> or <span class="SmallCaps">abutments</span> below. Beam bridges usually can’t span great distances because the girders required would be too large. At a certain distance, the beams become so heavy that they can hardly support their own weight, let alone the roadway and traffic on top. Beams are mainly used for short bridges or in applications that allow for many intermediate piers for support. Most bridges used in highway interchanges are of the beam type. Although beautiful in their own way, overpasses are usually quite utilitarian. (See Chapter 3 for more details on interchanges.)</p>
<p>One way around the challenge of the structural members’ self-weight is to use a <span class="SmallCaps">truss</span> instead of a girder. A truss is an assembly of smaller elements that creates a rigid and lightweight structure. This weight reduction allows trusses to span greater distances than solid beams. <span class="SmallCaps">Truss bridges</span> can take many forms. The illustration shows a <em>through truss</em>, with the road <span class="SmallCaps">deck</span> on the bottom level and structural members above the bridge (as opposed to a <em>deck truss</em>, which hides the structural members below the road).</p>
<p>Another type of bridge takes advantage of a structural feature that has been around for millennia: the <span class="SmallCaps">arch</span>. Most materials are stronger against forces along their axis than those applied at right angles (called <em>bending forces</em>). <span class="SmallCaps">Arch bridges</span> use a curved element to transfer the bridge’s weight to abutments using compression forces almost exclusively. Many of the oldest bridges used arches because it was the only way to span a gap with materials available at the time (stone and mortar). Even now, with the convenience of modern steel and concrete, arches are a popular choice for bridges. They make efficient use of materials but can be challenging to construct because the arch can’t provide its support until it is complete. Temporary supports are required during construction until the arch is connected at its apex from both sides.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_98" title="98"/>When the arch is below the roadway, we call it a <em>deck arch bridge</em> (like the example shown). Vertical supports transfer the load of the deck onto the arch. If part of the arch extends above the roadway with the deck suspended below, it’s called a <em>through arch bridge</em>. Arches can be formed in many ways, including individual steel beams, steel trusses, reinforced concrete, or even stone or brick masonry. One result of compressing an arch is that it creates horizontal forces called <em>thrusts</em>. Arch bridges usually need strong abutments at either side to push against that can withstand the extra horizontal loads. Alternatively, a <em>tied arch bridge</em> uses a chord to connect both sides of the arch like a bowstring so it can resist the thrust forces. If each end of the arch sits atop a spindly pier, you can be sure that they are tied together.</p>
<p>Another way to increase the span of a beam bridge is to move the supports so that sections of the deck balance on their center instead of being supported at each end. A <span class="SmallCaps">cantilever bridge</span> uses beams or trusses that project horizontally from their supports, moving most of the weight above the supports rather than in the center of the span. A typical cantilever bridge has four supports, of which the two central piers bear the compression loads from the bridge. The outermost supports resist tension to provide the balancing force for each <span class="SmallCaps">cantilevered arm</span>. Cantilever bridges often use large steel trusses, but they can be constructed of concrete as well. Some even include a <span class="SmallCaps">suspended section</span> between the two cantilevered arms.</p>
<p>The longest bridges in the world take advantage of steel’s ability to withstand incredible tension forces. <span class="SmallCaps">Cable-stayed bridges</span> support the bridge deck from above through cables attached to tall <span class="SmallCaps">towers</span>. The cables (also called <span class="SmallCaps">stays</span>) form a fan pattern, giving this type of bridge its unique appearance. Depending on the span, cable-stayed bridges can have one central tower or a pair. Their simplicity allows for a wide variety of configurations, giving rise to some dramatic (and often asymmetric) shapes.</p>
<p>Where a cable-stayed bridge attaches the deck directly to each tower, a <span class="SmallCaps">suspension bridge</span> instead uses two massive <span class="SmallCaps">main cables</span> to dangle the road deck below with vertical <span class="SmallCaps">hangers</span>. Suspension bridges are iconic structures due to their enormous spans and slender, graceful appearance. A <span class="SmallCaps">tower</span> on either side props up the main cables like a broomstick in a blanket fort. Most of the bridge’s weight is transferred into the foundation through these towers. The rest is transferred into the bridge’s abutments through immense <span class="SmallCaps">anchorages</span> keeping the cables from pulling out of the ground. Because they are so slender and lightweight, most suspension bridges require stiffening with girders or <span class="SmallCaps">trusses</span> along the deck to reduce movement from wind and traffic loads. These bridges are costly to build and maintain, so they are constructed only when no other structure will suffice. Many consider suspension bridges to be the pinnacle of civil engineering ingenuity.</p>
<p>One final style of bridges is those that move, usually to allow passage for boats and ships. Although not common, there <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_99" title="99"/>are numerous types of moveable bridges around the world, all of which are unique and customized for a specific location. One of my favorite activities in a new city is to watch a moving bridge to try to figure out how it works. </p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">When funding is tight, one option to span a small stream is a <em>low water crossing</em>. Unlike bridges built above the typical flood level, low water crossings are designed to be submerged when water levels rise. They are most common in areas prone to flash floods, where runoff in streams rises and falls quickly. Ideally, a crossing would be inaccessible only a few times per year during heavy rainstorms. However, low water crossings have some other disadvantages. For one, these types of bridges can block the passage of fish just like a dam. The other problem with low water crossings has to do with safety. A significant proportion of flood-related fatalities occur when someone tries to drive a car or truck through water overtopping a roadway. Water is heavy. It takes only a small but swift flow to push a vehicle down into a river or creek, which means at least some of the resources saved by avoiding the cost of a bridge often are spent to erect barricades during storms, install automatic flood warning systems at busy crossings, and run advertisement campaigns encouraging motorists never to drive through water overtopping a roadway.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c04-0003"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_101" title="101"/>Typical Bridge Section</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Although every bridge is different, most share common elements that can be observed from the outside. A cross section through a bridge reveals the individual parts that contribute to its function. Bridges are often divided between the <span class="SmallCaps">superstructure</span> (which carries the traffic loads across each span) and the <span class="SmallCaps">substructure</span> (which transfers the weight of the superstructure into the foundation). Each of the two sections contains fascinating details.</p>
<p>The surface of a bridge upon which vehicles travel is called the <span class="SmallCaps">deck</span>. Most often, it consists of a concrete slab set atop the beams. In some cases, the deck is <em>precast</em>, meaning the concrete has already been formed and cured before it is lifted into place. Otherwise, the deck is cast in place, using formwork to hold its shape until the concrete hardens. If this method is used during construction, it must be done carefully. Concrete is heavy, after all, and as more and more of it is added to the beams, the structure will begin to flex. To avoid cracks, contractors carefully sequence their work so that most of this movement happens early during placement before the concrete fully hardens.</p>
<p>The deck includes a slope, either from the center (called a <em>crown</em>) or from one edge, to ensure that rainwater won’t pond on the roadway. A layer of waterproofing and pavement is added to the concrete deck slab to protect it from harsh weather and damage from traffic. This <span class="SmallCaps">wearing course</span> also smooths out any unevenness, providing a more enjoyable ride for motorists. It is meant to be replaced regularly while the slab beneath remains a permanent part of the bridge. A bridge deck also often features <span class="SmallCaps">safety barriers</span> along the edges to prevent errant vehicles from falling off, <span class="SmallCaps">drains</span> to direct water away from structural members, and <span class="SmallCaps">walkways</span> to accommodate pedestrian traffic.</p>
<p>Most bridges will have some type of beams, or girders, to support the deck, depending on the design. For beam bridges, these are the primary load-bearing elements transferring all the forces to the substructure. For other types of bridges, the beams may only be adding stiffness to the deck or supporting its weight between hangers, cable stays, or the nodes of a truss that do the brunt of the lifting. Girders experience the most significant forces along their upper and lower extremities. Generally, the top of the beam undergoes compression and the bottom experiences tension, so most girders are shaped like a capital “I” to have more material in the <span class="SmallCaps">flanges</span>, with a narrow <span class="SmallCaps">web</span> in the center where forces are not so significant. These girders are usually made from steel <span class="SmallCaps">plates</span> or reinforced <span class="SmallCaps">concrete</span>. Another popular shape is the <span class="SmallCaps">box girder</span>, which is essentially a closed structural tube. Boxes are often used on bridges that curve because they can withstand twisting better than typical girders.</p>
<p><span class="SmallCaps">Bearings</span> transfer loads of the superstructure to the substructure; they “bear” <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_102" title="102"/>the bridge’s weight. The girders can’t sit directly on the piers or abutments for a straightforward reason: bridges move. The superstructure deforms and vibrates under the moving traffic loads, expands under the glaring sun, and shrinks when it cools down (especially on frigid winter nights). Without isolation from the substructure, these movements would build up stress and potentially cause structural members to fail. Bearings provide this isolation while also reducing wear and tear on the supports by making sure forces are evenly distributed. There are many exciting solutions to these challenges, and if you pay attention, you’ll notice a wide variety of bridge bearing styles.</p>
<p>Most modern bridges use an <em>elastomeric</em> (in other words, flexible) material to support the weight of the deck and girders while allowing for minor vibrations, rotations, and translations between the piers. Sometimes this <span class="SmallCaps">elastomeric</span> <span class="SmallCaps">bearing pad</span> is a standalone component consisting of pure rubber or laminated layers of rubber and steel plates to control bulging. Another option is a <span class="SmallCaps">pot bearing</span>, which houses the elastomeric material in a steel cylinder. The pot keeps the rubber from squishing out at its sides, allowing the use of a softer and more pliable material. Pot bearings sometimes include steel plates to accommodate sliding motions and can be designed to restrain or release different motions, depending on the needs of each bridge. Many older bridges used <span class="SmallCaps">roller bearings</span> or <span class="SmallCaps">rocker bearings</span> to allow for both rotation and horizontal movement of the superstructure. These types of bearings are mostly being phased out because they are costly to maintain.</p>
<p>The substructure consists of vertical elements that carry the loads from the girders, deck, trusses, cables, and hangers and transfer them to the underlying ground. A substructure can take many different forms, depending on the nature of the soil and rock below the bridge, whether the elements will be subject to powerful scour forces from a river, and the type of bridge being supported. Solid intermediate supports are usually called <em>piers</em>. Alternatively, when a support consists of multiple <span class="SmallCaps">columns</span> with a <span class="SmallCaps">cap</span>, it is called a <span class="SmallCaps">bent</span>. At each terminus of the bridge span is an <em>abutment</em>. These supports are often larger than piers or bents because they withstand both vertical and horizontal loads from the superstructure. Abutments also serve as the transition between a bridge and the at-grade roadway, so they sometimes act as a retaining wall for the soil below the approaching roadway.</p>
<p>The bridge’s foundation is the part of the substructure that transfers the weight of the piers, bents, or abutments into the earth. Some foundations consist of a simple concrete pad called a footing. However, most bridge foundations use <span class="SmallCaps">piles</span>, slender steel, or concrete members drilled or driven into the earth. Sometimes piles are battered (in other words, given an angle from vertical) to help resist horizontal forces in addition to vertical ones. Multiple piles are used at each support, and the group is tied together with a <span class="SmallCaps">pile cap</span> upon which the columns sit.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">The bearings between the sub- and superstructures provide support while allowing freedom of motion to avoid building up unnecessary stresses, but bridges also need a gap in the road deck to make room for such movement. This gap is called an expansion joint, and it must be at least as wide as the difference between the bridge’s length on its hottest and coldest days. The longer the bridge’s span, the wider this gap must be. Motorists and their vehicles don’t like to drive over large, unsupported spaces. So, bridge decks include miniature bridges that allow cars and trucks to safely pass the expansion joint. These joints usually feature interlocking steel fingers or a compliant rubber material to close the gap for motorists. Listen for the “clomp-clomp” as you pass over it the next time you’re driving on a bridge or elevated roadway.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c04-0004"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_105" title="105"/>Overview of Tunnels</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The concept of a tunnel is relatively straightforward: a hollow tube through the earth within which motor vehicles, trains, and even pedestrians can travel. However, tunnels are among the most technically challenging and expensive engineering projects in the world. A few types of infrastructure make use of underground tubes (many of which are discussed within this book), but this chapter focuses on tunnels used for transportation. Although costly and challenging to construct, tunnels enable travel across geographic features that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to traverse. They also open a whole new dimension of travel, maximizing the use of valuable land in dense urban areas. It’s a different world below the Earth’s surface, both for engineers designing tunnels and the travelers passing through them. But there is something inherently intriguing about navigating through the ground rather than on its surface.</p>
<p>One of the primary jobs of a tunnel is to allow people to cross an obstacle. Tunnels are common in mountainous regions where grades are too steep or treacherous along the surface. Instead of winding up and over the steep topography, sometimes it is more practical to simply go right through it. Some <span class="SmallCaps">mountain tunnels</span> stretch only a short distance between <span class="SmallCaps">portals</span> (the name for tunnel entrances and exits), but the longest are upward of 30 miles (50 kilometers) long.</p>
<p>Water is another obstacle that can be overcome with a tunnel. Bridges aren’t always the simplest way to cross a river or bay, especially in areas with heavy maritime traffic. Where a bridge might encroach on a waterway with its supports, an <span class="SmallCaps">underwater tunnel</span> allows for unrestricted travel of boats and ships.</p>
<p>Another critical role of tunnels comes in dense urban areas where space on the surface is precious. Rapid transit railways often use subterranean space, allowing them to avoid conflicts with surface roadways and other infrastructure. Because they usually aren’t far below the surface, many <span class="SmallCaps">rapid transit tunnels</span> are often constructed using the <em>cut-and-cover</em> method, starting with a <span class="SmallCaps">trench</span>. Excavating below the surface of an urban area is a disruptive and challenging ordeal. Existing roadways must be rerouted. <span class="SmallCaps">Utility lines</span> must be protected or redirected. Nearby buildings may need extra support to avoid settling. <span class="SmallCaps">Retaining walls</span> are required to hold the trench open while the tunnel can be constructed (more on them in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 3">Chapter 3</span>). Finally, groundwater must be continuously managed. If the retaining walls are not watertight, temporary <span class="SmallCaps">dewatering wells</span> may be installed to pump it directly from the earth. Another option is <em>ground freezing</em>, which uses a refrigeration system and coolant pipes to freeze a layer of water and earth into an impermeable barrier. This temporary wall of ice strengthens the soil and prevents the migration of groundwater into the work area.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_106" title="106"/>Once the trench is excavated, the features of the tunnel itself can be constructed, whether rail or roadway. The <span class="SmallCaps">roof</span> is the final element to be installed. After that, the trench is backfilled, and the infrastructure on the surface can be restored. </p>
<p>Cut-and-cover methods are often used to build underwater tunnels as well. In <em>immersed tube construction</em>, prefabricated tunnel sections can be carefully sunk into dredged trenches below the water. Each unit is attached by divers, backfilled with soil to prevent floating, and then pumped dry. In urban areas, cut-and-cover tunnels are usually constructed in short sections because it isn’t feasible to open a long stretch of the ground in a city for months or years. Such disruption is avoided by the other method of tunnel construction: <em>boring</em>.</p>
<p>Just like cut-and-cover, boring a tunnel follows a few main steps: excavate and remove the soil or rock, install supports to hold back the surrounding earth and water, then complete the tunnel features. The benefit of boring is that it can be performed without disturbing the surface, speeding up construction and making it possible to build in areas that would be otherwise inaccessible (such as along busy streets or below existing buildings). Although historical methods of tunnel construction used a variety of techniques, modern tunnels are bored in two primary ways. First, they can be manually excavated. In rock, the face of the tunnel is advanced by drilling <span class="SmallCaps">blasting holes</span>, filling the holes with explosives, and blasting the material apart. In soft soils, crews may use a temporary support called a <em>shield</em> to provide access to the tunnel face. A significant benefit of manually excavating a tunnel is that the design can be adjusted to accommodate changing geology. Additional support is installed only when needed (for example, when the rock is weak or fractured), saving the cost of unnecessary strengthening.</p>
<p>The other option is to use a <span class="SmallCaps">tunnel boring machine</span> (TBM). These massive pieces of equipment act like giant drills, using a rotating <span class="SmallCaps">cutterhead</span> to chew through the rock and soil. TBMs also include <span class="SmallCaps">conveyors</span> to remove the spoils as they are excavated and equipment to install concrete <span class="SmallCaps">lining segments</span> that support the tunnel walls and roof. (The next section includes more details on tunnel lining.) Although they are hugely expensive and difficult to transport, these machines can make tunnel construction a rapid and efficient process. They are most often used on long, large-diameter projects or tunnels in very challenging ground conditions.</p>
<p>Tunnel excavation tends to be a slow process, so longer tunnels are sometimes constructed from both sides at the same time. This cuts down on construction time but creates a challenge. How can two crews blindly bore toward each other and meet accurately in the middle? The surveyors who guide tunnel construction crews or a TBM in the right direction do not have access to navigational satellites or surface reference markers. Instead, they often rely on the Earth’s magnetic field to establish a bearing. A magnetic compass isn’t accurate enough for this purpose because of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_107" title="107"/>interference from iron and steel used in construction. Even a tiny error in direction can compound to significant deviations over a long distance. So, surveyors make use of gyroscopes that can point toward north to a high degree of precision. These instruments make it possible for tunnels to accurately break through in the center of the exit shaft and even for two tunnel construction crews to meet in the middle.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Driving into a tunnel during the day creates a sharp transition from the bright sunlight outside to the artificial illumination inside the tunnel. Engineers call this the <em>black hole effect</em>. It can be a serious safety issue because human eyes adjust to changes in brightness gradually. Drivers can be blinded by the sudden darkness at the entrance of a tunnel and the subsequent brilliance at the exit. Many creative solutions have been employed to solve this luminosity predicament. Some tunnels use shade structures ahead of each portal to provide a smoother transition in illumination. Some use white paint on the walls at the entrance and exit to reflect more of the artificial light into the driver’s vision. Most modern tunnels simply use custom lighting to ensure motorists see clearly along the entire length. Pay attention, and you’ll notice the intensity of the lights gradually changing from bright to dim and bright again as you pass through.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c04-0005"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_109" title="109"/>Tunnel Cross Section</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Every tunnel is a unique structure designed for a specific situation. It may not seem like there is much room for variety when it comes to digging passageways through the ground. However, many considerations can affect a tunnel’s design, including location, length, depth, geology, traffic volume, and more. Many details make it possible to travel in passageways through the earth in safety and comfort, and they are fun to spot if you know what to look out for.</p>
<p>Like atmospheric pressure created by the weight of air, pressure also exists in the earth’s subsurface from the mass of the soil and rock above. This pressure compresses the subterranean material more and more the farther down you go. Building a tunnel through the earth interrupts the flow of these compressive forces. Similar to removing a column from a building, excavating a tunnel takes away the support. Tunnels are often constructed below the groundwater table, making them subject to water pressure as well. But where loads in a building come only from above, earth and water pressure in a tunnel can come from all sides. Most tunnels are installed with a <em>lining</em> to resist the pressure from the ground, hold the passageway open against collapse, and minimizing the infiltration of groundwater.</p>
<p><span class="SmallCaps">Manually bored tunnels</span> are often lined using concrete sprayed on the walls, called <span class="SmallCaps">shotcrete</span>, to provide the initial support. This layer helps hold the soil and rock together while stresses redistribute after excavation. A <span class="SmallCaps">final lining</span> of steel or concrete is added later. In urban <span class="SmallCaps">cut-and-cover tunnels</span>, the lining usually consists of reinforced concrete cast in place. The falsework and reinforcing steel are erected first, and then concrete is pumped or poured into the forms to harden. Once it has cured, the formwork is removed, and the soil around the tunnel <span class="SmallCaps">walls </span>and<span class="SmallCaps"> roof</span> can be backfilled. For <span class="SmallCaps">machine-bored tunnels</span>, the lining usually consists of concrete <span class="SmallCaps">rings</span>. Each ring is made from precast segments and delivered to the tunnel face, ready to be lifted into place. The segments include a gasket to seal out groundwater and use tapered geometry to lock tightly together when installed.</p>
<p>Most tunnels have an arched or circular cross section because it’s the strongest shape against ground pressure. The arch redistributes the forces around the passage just like an arch bridge over a river. However, a tunnel may not look circular to a motorist since many use <span class="SmallCaps">interior walls</span> to separate traffic from the various support systems and utilities. Although they are often hidden from view, a careful observer can see hints of these systems when traveling through a tunnel.</p>
<p>A critical function of a tunnel’s support systems is drainage. There must be a way to manage precipitation that comes in through the portals, groundwater that seeps through the lining, and water used to wash the tunnel walls or for fighting fires. Drainage usually enters a <span class="SmallCaps">channel</span> or pipe through slots in the roadway curbs. When possible, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_110" title="110"/>a tunnel can be sloped such that water drains from the center toward the portals. However, many tunnels are too deep underground to drain freely. In this case, they are equipped with small reservoirs at low spots called sumps. When the sump fills with water, a switch turns on a pump that delivers the tunnel drainage to a sewer or outfall. The water in a tunnel often picks up pollution as it travels, so it can become quite dirty. Modern tunnels often include ways to treat drainage before discharging it.</p>
<p>One of the most vital safety elements of a tunnel is ventilation. Engines, tires, and brakes emit a range of pollutants that can be confined and concentrated inside a tunnel. Also, vehicles occasionally catch fire. When this happens in a tunnel, the resulting smoke can be particularly hazardous because there aren’t many options for egress. Managing the flow of air into and out of a tunnel is quite complicated. Too little ventilation will allow pollution to build up. However, excessive airflow can accelerate the growth of a fire and create turbulence that prevents smoke from rising. Tunnels employ many different ventilation schemes to keep the fresh air flowing.</p>
<p>Many tunnels work like simple pipes with fresh air entering one portal and exhaust air leaving the opposite side. This scheme is known as <em>longitudinal ventilation</em>. It is accomplished using <span class="SmallCaps">jet fans</span> mounted to the ceiling that force the air inside the tunnel to keep moving. Another option is to blow a jet of air into the tunnel entrance at a shallow angle through an opening called a <em>Saccardo nozzle</em>. Longitudinal ventilation works best on tunnels with a single direction for traffic flow because the air moves along with the vehicles. During a fire, the cars beyond the accident can exit the tunnel along with the airflow carrying away smoke. Vehicles caught upstream of the fire are also upwind, so they aren’t exposed to harmful smoke.</p>
<p>Above a certain length, longitudinal ventilation becomes less efficient. It is challenging to create enough pressure to keep the air moving effectively over exceptionally long distances. And, even if the airflow is sufficient, it picks up pollutants as it travels such that its quality at the end of the tunnel is much poorer than at the entrance. In these cases, it makes more sense to use <em>transverse ventilation</em> where the air is supplied or exhausted at discrete locations throughout the tunnel’s length. Transverse ventilation requires <span class="SmallCaps">ducts</span> to deliver fresh air or remove exhaust from each <span class="SmallCaps">damper</span> in the tunnel. Two ducts are necessary for a fully transverse system: one for <span class="SmallCaps">supply air</span> and one for <span class="SmallCaps">exhaust</span>. The newest ventilation systems use zones that can extract smoke from a fire without transporting it along the length of the entire tunnel. Sophisticated control systems can identify accidents and adjust dampers and fans to isolate each zone.</p>
<p>Many tunnels feature <span class="SmallCaps">emergency exits</span> to ensure motorists can reach a safe place in case of an accident or fire. The well-marked doorways lead either to an adjacent parallel tunnel or a protected <span class="SmallCaps">evacuation</span> <span class="SmallCaps">corridor</span>. Ventilation keeps the evacuation routes pressurized so that smoke can’t enter even when the doors are open.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">A tunnel ventilation system must be adjustable to ensure that enough fresh air is delivered no matter the volume of traffic or the emergencies that arise. Many designs work like the thermostat in your house, except instead of using temperature, they measure air pollution. When the quality of the atmosphere inside the tunnel starts to decline, the monitoring system increases fan speed or opens dampers to refresh it with outside air. However, measuring pollution takes a lot more ingenuity than measuring temperature. Many air quality sensors in tunnels use light to sense the concentration of dangerous gases. An emitter sends out an intense beam through the tunnel’s ambient air. The receiver measures the intensity of the light a short distance away. Many kinds of pollution can reach hazardous levels inside a tunnel, and each one has a fingerprint revealed by the specific wavelengths of light it absorbs. The receiver uses complex algorithms to estimate the concentration of many different gases with high accuracy. This process is called <em>spectroscopy</em>, and the monitoring devices that use this principle have a distinct appearance. Look for a pair of enclosures with cylindrical light shields facing each other from a short distance away.</p>

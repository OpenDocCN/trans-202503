		<p class="noindent">The goal of this volume was to help you consider the impact of your high-level coding techniques on the resulting machine code generated by the compiler. Unless you understand the cost tradeoffs of statements and data structures in your HLL programs, you won’t be able to produce efficient programs consistently. And if you want to write great code, you can’t write inefficient programs. To that end, the first two books of this series, <em>Understanding the Machine</em> and <em>Thinking Low-Level, Writing High-Level</em>, have addressed efficiency concerns facing modern programmers. However, as noted in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1</a>, efficiency isn’t the only attribute of great code. Thus, the next volume, <em>Engineering Software</em>, will change direction and discuss some of the other attributes.</p>&#13;
		<p class="indent">Specifically, Volume 3 begins discussing the personal software engineering aspects of programming. The software engineering field focuses primarily on the management of large software systems. Personal software engineering, on the other hand, covers those topics germane to writing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_600"/>great code at a personal level—craftsmanship, art, and pride in one’s work. So, in <em>Engineering Software</em>, we’ll consider those aspects through discussions on software development metaphors, software developer metaphors, and system documentation, among other topics.</p>&#13;
		<p class="indent">Congratulations on your progress thus far toward writing great code. See you in Volume 3.</p>&#13;

- en: Understanding how ML systems are created gives you a better understanding of
    how the world around you works. That understanding provides insight into how companies
    know what you’re thinking and recommend products you might like. And it helps
    you recognize that when you’re asked to rate something, or prove you’re a human,
    or tag a face in a photo, you’re probably training someone’s ML system.

    most important ML systems? And who should be checking how training is done? How
    should ML systems be tested, and should you be able to see the results of those
    tests for the ML systems you use?

    amount and balance of training data on ML models, the measures we use to describe
    an ML model’s performance, and the sorts of things that can go wrong—are all useful
    to get you thinking about these important questions.

    learn about how different ML systems are implemented. I hope that this book has
    encouraged you to explore more.

    of the AI projects created by companies around the world are built using online
    ML services provided “in the cloud,” just as you’ve been doing so far. With these
    services, you provide the training data, the cloud service creates an ML model
    using it, and then you test the model to make sure it does the job that you need.
    You can continue using Scratch if you want, or progress to using a text-based
    programming language like Python.

- en: Alternatively, if you’d like to understand more about how ML works, you can
    switch from using ML models that are built and hosted on the cloud to building
    and running your own ML models. This gives you more control over the behavior
    of your ML systems and also helps you learn how they work internally. You’ll need
    to start using a text-based programming language, such as Python, but if you’re
    willing to do that, there’s a wide variety of free ML technology frameworks available
    to get you started. TensorFlow is one of the most widely used, and there are free
    tutorials on the TensorFlow website ([https://www.tensorflow.org/](https://www.tensorflow.org/))
    that will help you build your first ML model.

    what you’ve learned about ML to create your own AI projects and applications,
    to build ML models yourself, or to understand a little more about how the online
    services you use every day work, I wish you luck with your next steps.

<div class="image1"><img src="graphics/common01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="ch05.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>, you learned how to ask questions in Python. You used comparison operators (like <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, and so on) and logical operators (<code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>not</code>) to find out whether a condition or set of conditions evaluated to <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. In this chapter, you’ll use the answers to these questions—the results of the conditions you test—to decide what code to run.</p>
<p class="indent">You make decisions based on conditions every day. Is it nighttime? If so, you wear your diamond armor and bring a sword to fight off monsters. If not, you might leave all your gear in your secret base. Are you hungry? If that’s true, you eat some bread or an apple. If not, you might go off on a grand adventure to work up an appetite. Just as you make decisions in everyday life, your programs need to do different tasks depending on a condition.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll use a bit of Python code to help your programs make decisions. <code>if</code> statements tell your program whether or not to run a particular piece of <a id="page_104"/>code. An <code>if</code> statement means “<em>If</em> this condition is true, run this code.” For example, you could check whether the player is standing in a forbidden room and turn the floor to lava if they are. Or, you could check whether they placed a certain block at a certain location and open a hidden door if they did. Using conditions and <code>if</code> statements, you can begin to make your own mini-games in Minecraft.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec01"><strong><span class="blue">USING IF STATEMENTS</span></strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Being able to control the execution of your program is a very powerful ability; in fact, it’s crucial to coding! Programmers sometimes call this concept <em>flow control</em>. The easiest way to add this kind of control is by using the simple <code>if</code> statement, which runs code when a condition is <code>True</code>.</p>
<p class="indentb">An <code>if</code> statement has three parts:</p>
<p class="bull">• The <code>if</code> operator</p>
<p class="bull">• A condition to test</p>
<p class="bull">• A body of code to run if the condition is <code>True</code></p>
<p class="indentt">Let’s look at an <code>if</code> statement in action. The following code will print <code>"That's a lot of zombies."</code> only if there are more than 20 zombies. Otherwise, it won’t do anything.</p>
<pre>zombies = <span class="rose">int</span>(<span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Enter the number of zombies: "</span>))<br/><span class="orange">if</span> zombies &gt; 20:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"That's a lot of zombies."</span>)</pre>
<p class="indent">Here, <code>zombies &gt; 20</code> is the condition we’re testing, and <code>print("That's a lot of zombies.")</code> is the body of the <code>if</code> statement; it’s the code that runs if <code>zombies &gt; 20</code> is <code>True</code>. The colon (<code>:</code>) at the end of the <code>if</code> line tells Python that the next line will start the body of the <code>if</code> statement. The indentation tells Python which lines of code make up this body. <em>Indentation</em> means there is extra space at the beginning of a line of text. In Python you indent lines by four spaces. If we wanted to add more lines of code to run inside the <code>if</code> statement, we would put the same number of spaces in front of all of them, indenting them just like <code>print("That's a lot of zombies.")</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">Try running this code a few times, testing each condition, and see what happens. For example, try entering a number that is less than 20, the number 20, and a number that is greater than 20. Here is what happens if you enter 22:</p>
<pre><span class="blue1">Enter the number of zombies:</span> 22<br/><span class="blue1">That's a lot of zombies.</span></pre>
<p class="indent">Okay, the result makes sense. Let’s run it another time and see what happens when the condition isn’t met.</p>
<pre><span class="blue1">Enter the number of zombies:</span> 5<br/><br/></pre>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_105"/>Notice that nothing happens if the condition is <code>False</code>. The body of the <code>if</code> statement is entirely ignored. An <code>if</code> statement will execute the code in its body only if the condition is <code>True</code>. When the <code>if</code> statement is finished, the program continues on the line after the <code>if</code> statement.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s look at another example to better understand how this works. The following code uses an <code>if</code> statement to check whether a password is correct:</p>
<pre>password = <span class="green">"cats"</span><br/>attempt = <span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Please enter the password: "</span>)<br/><span class="orange">if</span> attempt == password:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Password is correct"</span>)<br/><span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Program finished"</span>)</pre>
<p class="indent">The expression after the <code>if</code> statement is the condition: <code>attempt == password</code>. The indented line after <code>if attempt == password:</code> is the <code>if</code> statement’s body: <code>print("Password is correct")</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">The code will print <code>"Password is correct"</code> only if the value stored in the <code>attempt</code> variable is the same as the value in the <code>password</code> variable. If they are not the same, it will not print anything. The last line will run and print <code>"Program finished"</code> whether or not the body of the <code>if</code> statement runs.</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s try something a little more explosive.</p>
<h4 class="h4a" id="ch06lev2sec01"><strong>MISSION #26: BLAST A CRATER</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ve already learned how to make the player teleport and jump high. Now you’ll make the blocks around the player disappear.</p>
<p class="indent">When the program runs, the blocks above, below, and around the player will turn into air. This power is very destructive, so be careful when you use it. To be safe, the program will ask the user whether they are sure they want to destroy the blocks, and it will only do so if the user’s answer is yes.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="ch06.html#ch6ex1">Listing 6-1</a> creates a crater around the player by deleting all the blocks above, below, and around them. Then it posts <code>"Boom!"</code> to chat. Save this program as <em>crater.py</em> in a new folder called <em>ifStatements</em>.</p>
<p class="sidenote"><span class="blue"><em>crater.py</em></span></p>
<pre>   <span class="orange">from</span> mcpi.minecraft <span class="orange">import</span> Minecraft<br/>   mc = Minecraft.create()<br/><br/>   answer = <span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Create a crater? Y/N "</span>)<br/><br/><span class="ent">➊</span> <span class="red"># Add an if statement here</span><br/><br/>   pos = mc.player.getPos()<br/><span class="ent">➋</span> mc.setBlocks(pos.x + 1, pos.y + 1, pos.z + 1, pos.x - 1, pos.y - 1, pos.z - 1, 0)<br/>   mc.postToChat(<span class="green">"Boom!"</span>)</pre>
<p class="examplet"><a id="ch6ex1"/><em>Listing 6-1: This code creates a crater, no matter what the user enters.</em></p>
<p class="indent">The <code>answer</code> variable uses the <code>input()</code> function to ask the user whether they want to create a crater. At the moment, however, the code will create a crater no matter what the user enters—<code>Y</code>, <code>N</code>, something else, or nothing.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_106"/>To complete this program, you’ll need to add an <code>if</code> statement to check whether the user has input <code>Y</code> in response to the question. You can add that logic to the game at <span class="ent">➊</span>. Remember that the user’s response is stored in the <code>answer</code> variable, so your <code>if</code> statement should check the <code>answer</code> variable. After you add your <code>if</code> statement, the program should only run the last three lines of code when the player inputs <code>Y</code>. To do this, you must indent these lines by four spaces.</p>
<p class="indent">Keep in mind that the very last argument of the <code>setBlocks()</code> function should be the block type you want to set. Here, the last argument is <code>0</code>, the block type for air. In other words, the crater is created using <code>setBlocks()</code> to set the blocks to air <span class="ent">➋</span>, making it look like all the blocks around the player have been destroyed. By adding and subtracting 1 to the values of <code>pos.x</code>, <code>pos.y</code>, and <code>pos.z</code>, the code places air blocks around the player’s position as a 3 by 3 cube. This is the crater.</p>
<p class="indent">After you’ve made the changes to the program, save it and run it. The question <code>Create a Crater? Y/N</code> will appear in the Python shell. Enter either <code>Y</code> or <code>N</code>. Make sure the Y is a capital letter, or the program won’t work properly.</p>
<p class="indent">When the user enters <code>Y</code>, a crater will appear, as shown in <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig1">Figure 6-1</a>.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec02"><a id="page_107"/><strong><span class="blue">ELSE STATEMENTS</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Now we’ll look at a more advanced statement to use if we want to run a <em>different</em> piece of code when the <code>if</code> condition is <code>False</code>. That’s where the <code>else</code> statement comes in.</p>
<p class="indent">An <code>else</code> statement works together with an <code>if</code> statement. First you write an <code>if</code> statement to run some code if the condition is <code>True</code>. After the <code>if</code>, you write an <code>else</code> statement to run other code when the condition evaluates to <code>False</code>. It’s like you’re saying, “If the condition is true, do this. Otherwise, do something else.”</p>
<p class="indent">The following program will print <code>"Ahhhh! Zombies!"</code> if more than 20 zombies are in a room; otherwise, it will print <code>"You know, you zombies aren't so bad."</code></p>
<pre>zombies = <span class="rose">int</span>(<span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Enter the number of zombies: "</span>))<br/><span class="orange">if</span> zombies &gt; 20:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Ahhhh! Zombies!"</span>)<br/><span class="orange">else</span>:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"You know, you zombies aren't so bad."</span>)</pre>
<p class="indent">Like the <code>if</code> statement, the <code>else</code> statement uses a colon and indentation to indicate which code belongs to the body of the <code>else</code> statement. But the <code>else</code> statement can’t be used by itself; an <code>if</code> must come before it. The <code>else</code> statement does not have its own condition; the body of the <code>else</code> statement runs only if the <code>if</code> statement’s condition (<code>zombies &gt; 20</code> in this example) is not <code>True</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">Going back to the earlier password example, we can add an <code>else</code> statement to print a message when the password is incorrect, like this:</p>
<pre>password = <span class="green">"cats"</span><br/>attempt = <span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Please enter the password: "</span>)<br/><span class="orange">if</span> attempt == password:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Password is correct."</span>)<br/><span class="orange">else</span>:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Password is incorrect."</span>)</pre>
<p class="indent">When the value of <code>attempt</code> matches the value of <code>password</code>, the condition will be <code>True</code>. The program runs the code that prints <code>"Password is correct."</code></p>
<p class="indent">When <code>attempt</code> does not match <code>password</code>, the condition will be <code>False</code>. The program runs the code that prints <code>"Password is incorrect."</code></p>
<p class="indent">What if an <code>else</code> statement is used without an <code>if</code> statement? For example, if a program had just these two lines:</p>
<pre><span class="orange">else</span>:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Nothing happened."</span>)</pre>
<p class="noindent">Python wouldn’t understand what was going on, and you’d get an error.</p>
<h4 class="h4a" id="ch06lev2sec03"><a id="page_108"/><strong>MISSION #27: PREVENT SMASHING, OR NOT</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">In <a href="ch05.html#ch05lev2sec01">Mission #17</a> (<a href="ch05.html#page_82">page 82</a>), you made a program that stopped the player from smashing blocks by making the world immutable using <code>mc.setting("world_immutable", True)</code>. The program helped you protect your precious creations from accidents or vandals. But even though it was useful, the program wasn’t very flexible. Turning it off required a second program, which is pretty inconvenient!</p>
<p class="indent">Using an <code>if</code> statement, an <code>else</code> statement, and console input, you can make a program that turns immutable on and off. Your program will ask whether you want the blocks to be immutable and then set immutable to <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> depending on your response.</p>
<p class="indent">Open IDLE and create a new file. Save the file as <em>immutableChoice.py</em> in the <em>ifStatements</em> folder. Follow these instructions to complete the program:</p>
<ol>
<li><p class="noindent">The program needs to ask the user whether they want to make the blocks immutable:</p>
<pre><span class="green">"Do you want blocks to be immutable? Y/N"</span></pre>
<p class="indent">Add this string as an argument inside <code>input()</code> and store the input in a variable called <code>answer</code>.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent">The program checks whether the value stored in the <code>answer</code> variable is <code>"Y"</code>. If it is, it runs the following code:</p>
<pre>mc.setting(<span class="green">"world_immutable"</span>, <span class="orange">True</span>)<br/>mc.postToChat(<span class="green">"World is immutable"</span>)</pre>
<p class="indent">Copy this code and put it in an <code>if</code> statement so it runs only if the value of the <code>answer</code> variable is equal to <code>"Y"</code>. Don’t forget to indent!</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent">The program runs the following code if the <code>answer</code> variable is not <code>"Y"</code>.</p>
<pre>mc.setting(<span class="green">"world_immutable"</span>, <span class="orange">False</span>)<br/>mc.postToChat(<span class="green">"World is mutable"</span>)</pre>
<p class="indent">Copy this code and put it in an indented <code>else</code> statement.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Save and run the program. When it asks whether or not you want to make the blocks immutable, type <code>Y</code> or <code>N</code> and press <small>ENTER</small>. Test the program. When you choose to make blocks immutable, they shouldn’t break; otherwise, they should be breakable.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="ch06.html#ch6fig2">Figure 6-2</a> shows the output message and question in the shell.</p>

<p class="noindent">We could make this program more user friendly by using Boolean operators to accept variations on <code>"Yes"</code> and <code>"No"</code>, such as lowercase <code>"yes"</code>, uppercase <code>"YES"</code>, and a single-character response <code>"y"</code>. Give it a shot!</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch06lev2sec04"><strong><span class="blue">ELIF STATEMENTS</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Using an <code>if</code> statement and an <code>else</code> statement, your program was able to run some code if a condition was <code>True</code> and different code if the condition was <code>False</code>. But what if you want more than two blocks of code to run?</p>
<p class="indent">To do this, you can use an <code>else-if</code> statement, or <code>elif</code> in Python. First you write an <code>if</code> statement, then you write an <code>elif</code> statement, and then you write an <code>else</code> statement. When you use these statements together, you’re saying, “If a condition is <code>True</code>, run this code. Otherwise, if a second, different condition is <code>True</code>, run some other code. Finally, if neither of those two conditions is <code>True</code>, run some other code.”</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at it. Say you’re deciding what flavor to buy at the ice cream shop. You might say, “If there’s any chocolate ice cream left, I’ll get that. If there isn’t chocolate, but there’s strawberry, I’ll get strawberry. If there isn’t chocolate or strawberry, I’ll get vanilla.”</p>
<p class="indent">In a program, this decision process looks like this:</p>
<pre>hasChocolate = <span class="orange">False</span><br/>hasStrawberry = <span class="orange">True</span><br/><span class="orange">if</span> hasChocolate:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Hooray! I'm getting chocolate."</span>)<br/><span class="orange">elif</span> hasStrawberry:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"I'm getting the second best flavor, strawberry."</span>)<br/><span class="orange">else</span>:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Vanilla is OK too, I guess."</span>)</pre>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_110"/>The first two lines just set the stage for the scenario: we’ll assume that today, the ice cream shop doesn’t have any chocolate left but does have strawberry. So we set <code>hasChocolate</code> to <code>False</code> and <code>hasStrawberry</code> to <code>True</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">Next is the logic of the decision process: an <code>if</code> statement prints <code>"Hooray! I'm getting chocolate."</code> if <code>hasChocolate</code> is <code>True</code>. But in this example, it’s <code>False</code>, so that message isn’t printed. Instead, the program goes on to the <code>elif</code> statement and tests whether <code>hasStrawberry</code> is <code>True</code>. Because it is, the code in the body of the <code>elif</code> statement runs and prints <code>"I'm getting the second best flavor, strawberry."</code></p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, this <code>elif</code> statement has its own condition and body. The <code>elif</code> statement executes only when the condition of the <code>if</code> statement is <code>False</code> and the condition of the <code>elif</code> statement is <code>True</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the <code>else</code> statement after the <code>elif</code> statement executes when the <code>if</code> statement’s condition is <code>False</code> and the <code>elif</code> statement’s condition is also <code>False</code>. In this example, the <code>else</code> statement’s code would run if both <code>hasChocolate</code> and <code>hasStrawberry</code> were <code>False</code>, printing <code>"Vanilla is OK too, I guess."</code></p>
<p class="indent">For another example, let’s go back to the program that printed <code>"Ahhhh! Zombies!"</code> if more than 20 zombies were in a room. We can add an <code>elif</code> statement to test another condition when the <code>if</code> statement’s condition is <code>False</code>:</p>
<pre>zombies = <span class="rose">int</span>(<span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Enter the number of zombies: "</span>))<br/><span class="orange">if</span> zombies &gt; 20:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Ahhhh! Zombies!"</span>)<br/><span class="orange">elif</span> zombies == 0:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"No zombies here! Phew!"</span>)<br/><span class="orange">else</span>:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"You know, you zombies aren't so bad."</span>)</pre>
<p class="indent">We add an <code>elif</code> statement to compare <code>zombies</code> and 0. If <code>zombies == 0</code> is <code>True</code>, the code in the <code>elif</code> statement’s body prints <code>"No zombies here! Phew!"</code> If this <code>elif</code> statement’s condition is <code>False</code>, the code moves on to the <code>else</code> statement and prints <code>"You know, you zombies aren't so bad."</code></p>

<p class="noindent">There is no limit to the number of <code>elif</code> statements that you can include with an <code>if</code> statement. You can have one <code>elif</code> statement or 100 <code>elif</code> statements. Python just evaluates them one after the other.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s an example using the “number of zombies” program:</p>
<pre>   zombies = <span class="rose">int</span>(<span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Enter the number of zombies: "</span>))<br/>   <span class="orange">if</span> zombies &gt; 20:<br/>       <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Ahhhh!

<p class="indent">Here we’ve added a new <code>elif</code> statement at <span class="ent">➊</span>, right after the <code>if</code> statement, to check if more than 10 zombies are in the room. If there are, it prints <code>"There's just half a Minecraft zombie apocalypse."</code>; otherwise, the code moves on to the next <code>elif</code>.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_113"/>The order of the <code>if</code> and <code>elif</code> statements is very important. If you put them in the wrong order, some of the code may never be reached, and your program will not run as expected.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, if we swap the <code>if</code> statement’s condition with the first <code>elif</code> statement’s condition, we run into a problem:</p>
<pre>zombies = <span class="rose">int</span>(<span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Enter the number of zombies: "</span>))<br/><span class="orange">if</span> zombies &gt; 10:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"There's just half a Minecraft zombie apocalypse."</span>)<br/><span class="orange">elif</span> zombies &gt; 20:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Ahhhh!

<p class="indent">Why is this wrong? Let’s look at what happens when <code>zombies</code> is, say, 22. Because 22 is greater than 10, the first <code>if</code> statement’s condition, <code>zombies &gt; 10</code>, is <code>True</code>, and the <code>if</code> statement’s code runs. Once this happens, none of the other <code>elif</code> and <code>else</code> statements will run. The program never reaches <code>elif zombies &gt; 20</code> because it already ran the body of the <code>if</code> statement. This is a bug.</p>
<p class="indent">If you ever get unexpected results from your <code>if</code> statements, always double-check that your <code>if</code> and <code>elif</code> statements are in the correct order.</p>

<p class="indent">First, build a building. To do this quickly, find the <em>building.py</em> program (<a href="ch03.html#page_56">page 56</a>) in the <em>math</em> folder and run it.

<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec02"><a id="page_117"/><strong><span class="blue">USING IF STATEMENTS TO TEST A RANGE OF VALUES</span></strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">As you learned in <a href="ch05.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>, you can determine whether one value is between two other values in Python. Because a range check evaluates to <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>, you can use a range check as the condition in an <code>if</code> statement, just like you’d use a simple less than/greater than or equal to/not equal to comparison. Any expression that evaluates to <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> can be a condition of an <code>if</code> statement.</p>
<p class="indent">Say you’ve spent all day gathering ingredients to bake some delicious Minecraft cakes. You find enough ingredients to bake 30 cakes, and now you want to sell the cakes. The person buying cakes from you must buy 1 cake but less than 30; otherwise, you won’t sell cakes to that person. They can’t hog all the cakes!</p>
<p class="indent">This code represents the cake situation:</p>
<pre>   cakes = <span class="rose">int</span>(<span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Enter the number of cakes to buy: "</span>))<br/><span class="ent">➊</span> <span class="orange">if</span> 0 &lt; cakes &lt; 30:<br/>       <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Here are your "</span> + <span class="rose">str</span>(cakes) + <span class="green">" cakes."</span>)<br/><span class="ent">➋</span> <span class="orange">elif</span> cakes == 0:<br/>       print(<span class="green">"Don't you want some delicious cake?"</span>)<br/><span class="ent">➌</span> <span class="orange">else</span>:<br/>       <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"That's too many cakes! Don't be selfish!"</span>)</pre>
<p class="indent">If the <code>cakes</code> variable has a value between 0 and 30, such as 15, we print <code>"Here are your 15 cakes."</code> <span class="ent">➊</span>. Otherwise, we print a different message. If <code>cakes</code> has a value of 0, we print <code>"Don't you want some delicious cake?"</code> <span class="ent">➋</span> and if it’s greater than 30, we print <code>"That's too many cakes! Don't be selfish!"</code> <span class="ent">➌</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">We can test a more complicated expression by adding a Boolean operator. If I was really weird and didn’t want people to buy a quantity of bread between 20 and 30, I could do this using the <code>not</code> operator:</p>
<pre>bread = <span class="rose">int</span>(<span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Enter the amount of bread: "</span>))<br/><span class="orange">if not</span> 20 &lt;= bread &lt;= 30:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Here are your "</span> + bread + <span class="green">" breads."</span>)<br/><span class="orange">else</span>:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"I don't sell that amount of bread for some reason."</span>)</pre>
<p class="indent">Here I use a <code>not</code> operator and the greater than or equal to comparisons to test a range of values as the first condition. The range check determines whether the amount of bread people want to buy is between 20 and 30. Then, the <code>not</code> flips a <code>True</code> to <code>False</code> and a <code>False</code> to <code>True</code>. So if <code>bread</code> is in the range, the overall expression evaluates to <code>False</code>, and we run the code in the <code>else</code> statement. If <code>bread</code> is not in the range between 20 and 30—say it’s 40—the overall expression is <code>True</code>, and we print <code>"Here are your 40 breads."</code></p>
<p class="indent">If someone tries to buy 23 breads, I won’t let them. But 17 or 32 is just fine.</p>

<p class="noindent">Remember the teleport program you created back in <a href="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>? It was called <em>teleport.py</em>. In this mission, you’ll use range checks and <code>if</code> statements to limit where the player can teleport to. If you’re using Minecraft on the Raspberry Pi, there are places outside the game world that don’t exist, but your program will still let you teleport to them. If you’re using the desktop edition of Minecraft, your world is much bigger, so you don’t have the same restrictions as in the Pi edition of the game, but this program is still useful. For example, you could use it in a game of hide-and-seek to limit the area where players can hide.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="ch06.html#ch6ex6">Listing 6-6</a> is supposed to get the x-, y-, and z-coordinates from the user’s input and teleport them to that position. But the program isn’t complete.</p>

<p class="examplet"><a id="ch6ex6"/><em>Listing 6-6: A program to limit the locations that the player can teleport to</em></p>
<p class="indent">In order to restrict where the player can teleport to, we make a variable called <code>valid</code>. This variable will store a <code>True</code> or a <code>False</code> to represent whether or not all the coordinates in the destination are valid. We ask the user to input values for <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>. Then we have an <code>if</code> statement check whether the <code>x</code> variable is not between –127 and 127. If it’s not, this x-coordinate is invalid, and the <code>valid</code> variable is set to <code>False</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">When the program reaches the final <code>if</code> statement, <code>setPos()</code> will be called only if <code>valid</code> is <code>True</code>. And <code>valid</code> will be <code>True</code> only if all three conditions have been met. Otherwise, the player doesn’t get to teleport, and we post a chat message telling the user to enter a valid location.</p>
<p class="indent">Create a new file in IDLE and copy <a href="ch06.html#ch6ex6">Listing 6-6</a> into it. Save the program as <em>teleportLimit.py</em> in the <em>ifStatements</em> folder.</p>

The program should teleport you when you enter values that are within the –127 to 127 range for the <code>x</code> and <code>z</code> variables and within the –63 to 63 range for the <code>y</code> variable. When you enter a value that isn’t in these ranges, the program shouldn’t teleport you. <a href="ch06.html#ch6fig6">Figure 6-6</a> shows how the game should look when the user enters an invalid number.</p>

</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch06lev1sec03"><strong><span class="blue">BOOLEAN OPERATORS AND IF STATEMENTS</span></strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">In the previous mission, you used <code>not</code> in your <code>if</code> statements. You can also use <code>and</code> and <code>or</code>. In this case, the <code>if</code> statement will act just like it did with one simple condition: if the overall expression evaluates to <code>True</code>, the body of the statement will run. Here’s a program that asks someone if they have cake and whether they want to give us some cake:</p>
<pre>hasCake = <span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Do you have any cake? Y/N"</span>)<br/>wouldShare = <span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Would you give me some cake?

<p class="indent"><a id="page_120"/>This code uses the <code>and</code> operator, so Python will only print <code>"Yay!"</code> if the person has cake (<code>hasCake == "Y"</code> is <code>True</code>) and is willing to share it (<code>wouldShare == "Y"</code> is <code>True</code>). If either of these comparisons is not <code>True</code>, the code inside the <code>else</code> statement will print <code>"Boo!"</code></p>
<p class="indent">You can replace <code>and</code> with the <code>or</code> operator to make Python print <code>"Yay!"</code> if the person either has cake or would be willing to share it:</p>
<pre>hasCake = <span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Do you have any cake? Y/N"</span>)<br/>wouldShare = <span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Would you give me some cake?

<p class="indent">If either <code>hasCake == "Y"</code> or <code>wouldShare == "Y"</code> is <code>True</code>, the whole expression evaluates to <code>True</code>, and we print <code>"Yay!"</code> The only time we print <code>"Boo!"</code> is if neither condition is <code>True</code>: the person doesn’t have cake and wouldn’t share it if they did.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s try using the <code>not</code> operator with an <code>if</code> statement:</p>
<pre>wearingShoes = <span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Are you wearing shoes? Y/N"</span>)<br/><span class="orange">if not</span> wearingShoes == <span class="green">"Y"</span>:<br/>    <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"You're not wearing shoes."</span>)</pre>
<p class="indent">This program asks the user to enter <code>Y</code> if they are wearing shoes and <code>N</code> if they aren’t. It stores the input in <code>wearingShoes</code>. Next is a comparison between <code>wearingShoes</code> and <code>"Y"</code> to see whether they’re equal. The <code>not</code> operator reverses the result of a comparison—<code>True</code> becomes <code>False</code> and <code>False</code> becomes <code>True</code>—so if the user entered <code>Y</code>, the comparison starts off <code>True</code> and <code>not</code> makes it <code>False</code>, making the overall expression <code>False</code>. We don’t print a message. If the user didn’t enter <code>Y</code>, the comparison is <code>False</code> and <code>not</code> makes it <code>True</code>. The overall expression evaluates to <code>True</code>, and we print <code>"You're not wearing shoes."</code></p>

<p class="indent">To get the shower to work, you need to use range checks and Boolean operators.

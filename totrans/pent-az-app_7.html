<div class="image"><img src="../images/00015.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre3"/></div>
<p class="noindent">A paradox exists for penetration testers in that we are frequently trying to evade detection while simultaneously hoping the defenders stop us in our tracks. An offensive security professional’s job is not only to find and explain vulnerabilities in our clients’ systems but also to make those charged with monitoring and securing the enterprise better at what they do. Penetration tests can help determine where the gaps are in defenders’ rules and alerts and also keep defenders sharp and well-practiced in case a real adversary arrives.</p>
<p class="indent">This final chapter is a departure from the pentest techniques and tools covered in the previous chapters. I describe monitoring tools, logs, and alerts that defenders should be reviewing to detect the kinds of attacker movements described in the rest of the book. If a blue team is making use of these resources, it will be much harder for an attacker to make headway without being found and evicted.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_164"/>I begin with Azure Security Center (ASC), an Azure feature that consolidates security recommendations and events from different services and systems. Then I describe the Operations Management Suite (OMS), which collects events and provides centralized management of systems in Azure, corporate networks, and other cloud providers. Next, I cover the Secure DevOps Kit, a package of scripts to secure a subscription, enable important alerts, and provide continuous assurance. Finally, we look at collecting Azure service logs outside of management tools.</p>
<h3 class="h1" id="lev181"><strong class="calibre2">Azure Security Center</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Azure Security Center is a service offering in Azure that condenses key security information into a single view. By consolidating this data, Security Center enables administrators without the support of full-time security staff to quickly validate the security of their services. Teams that do include defense personnel can cover more subscriptions and free up staff to spend more time being proactive. Not having Azure Security Center enabled in a subscription is a pentester’s finding in and of itself.</p>
<p class="indent">While previously limited to security events from Azure services, Security Center began accepting events from non-Azure-based systems in mid-2017. This is referred to as <em class="calibre7">hybrid security</em> and is available to users of Azure Security Center’s paid tier of service. Azure Security Center analyzes logs from external systems that are imported to OMS workspaces, which are described in “<a href="part0017.html#lev185" class="calibre6">Setting Up OMS</a>” on <a href="part0017.html#page_169" class="calibre6">page 169</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Security Center has two main components: detection and prevention. <em class="calibre7">Detection</em> flags potentially illicit activity made against the subscription’s resources, and <em class="calibre7">prevention</em> examines the configurations of services to identify missing security controls. Let’s examine both in more depth.</p>
<h4 class="h2" id="lev182"><strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre10">Utilizing Security Center’s Detection Capabilities</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">A key requirement for any defender is threat detection and alerting. Security Center monitors VMs and SQL databases by reviewing logs and installing a small monitoring agent on the VMs. When Security Center detects an anomaly, an alert is generated in the Security Center pane within the Azure portal, as shown in <a href="part0017.html#ch08fig1" class="calibre6">Figure 8-1</a>. Optionally, Security Center can generate and send an email to designated security contacts or the subscription owners.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em class="calibre7">Threat detection capabilities are only enabled for customers using the paid (Standard) tier of Security Center, which has a monthly charge based on the number of VMs and databases in the subscription. The Security Center tier is set at a subscription level, so individual resources cannot be opted in or out of the service. If a client wants threat detection for production workloads but balks at paying Security Center’s fees for test systems, then consider having them split resources into two subscriptions—one using Security Center’s paid option and one using the free edition. Ideally, Security Center would monitor all nodes, but security recommendations must often compete with budgetary realities.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="image1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_165"/><a id="ch08fig1" class="calibre6"/><img src="../images/00061.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre3"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em class="calibre7">Figure 8-1: Azure Security Center main view with alerts</em></p>
<p class="indent">Security Center alerts on a variety of threats, from host-based detections to network events. Here’s a list of some of the alerts available:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="noindent1">Brute-force login attempts to Remote Desktop</li>
<li class="noindent1">Brute-force login attempts to SSH</li>
<li class="noindent1">Presence of a binary with a name that matches known malware</li>
<li class="noindent1">Execution of a binary with a known-malware signature</li>
<li class="noindent1">When a binary performs a suspicious action (determined through heuristics)</li>
<li class="noindent1">SQL injection attempts against databases</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">In addition to noting the resource where the alert was triggered, Security Center also provides details about the event and recommendations for how to remediate the problem, as shown in <a href="part0017.html#ch08fig2" class="calibre6">Figure 8-2</a>. Here, an administrator can see the name of the suspicious program, where it was run, who ran it, why it is considered dangerous, and steps for how to correct the problem.</p>
<div class="image1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_166"/><a id="ch08fig2" class="calibre6"/><img src="../images/00062.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre3"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em class="calibre7">Figure 8-2: Azure Security Center detection alert</em></p>
<p class="indent">One often-overlooked security benefit of running services in the cloud is that the cloud provider can watch for trends across all of their services. They can then use this information to better detect threats against their customers’ resources. For example, Microsoft tracks IP addresses of known cybercrime groups and monitors Azure VMs for outbound traffic to these systems in order to detect attacker command-and-control communications. With Azure Security Center, Microsoft can add new alerts over time as new hacking and detection techniques emerge, and these updates take effect immediately for Azure customers without any intervention needed.</p>
<h4 class="h2" id="lev183"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_167" class="calibre1"/><strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre10">Utilizing Security Center’s Prevention Capabilities</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Aside from alerting, Security Center also provides proactive security advice for a number of services. The recommendations aren’t a replacement for proper planning, threat modeling, and security assessments but rather are preventive tips that can help eliminate some of the most prevalent security mistakes. Prevention advice is included in both the free and paid tiers of Security Center.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, Security Center will check to make sure VMs are fully patched and are running endpoint protection software. It will also suggest applying Azure Disk Encryption to VMs, which would prevent the offline VHD analysis attack described in <a href="part0014.html#ch05" class="calibre6">Chapter 5</a>. Outside of VMs, Security Center will check that encryption is enabled for Azure SQL databases and storage accounts to protect data at rest, as shown in <a href="part0017.html#ch08fig3" class="calibre6">Figure 8-3</a>.</p>
<div class="image1"><a id="ch08fig3" class="calibre6"/><img src="../images/00063.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre3"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em class="calibre7">Figure 8-3: Azure Security Center preventive recommendations for SQL and storage</em></p>
<p class="indent">Additionally, prevention alerts can help make sure security doesn’t regress over time as users deploy new resources or as services undergo maintenance. If an administrator neglects a VM and fails to install patches, it will be very obvious because the compute status tile on the Azure Security Center blade’s main page will turn red with alerts. If an engineer temporarily disables a firewall for troubleshooting, this triggers an alert. But perhaps most importantly, if a new security feature is added to Azure that the client hasn’t used before, Security Center will alert the client that their services are no longer making use of every available protection. Given the quick pace of Azure updates, following all current best-practices is hard, but Azure Security Center can help take this task off of an administrator’s plate.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_168"/>If you discover uncorrected prevention alerts during an assessment, you should discuss this with the client. Here are some explanations the client might provide:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="noindent1">They don’t bother, or have time, to look at Security Center.</li>
<li class="noindent1">They believe a particular alert isn’t important or applicable, or they have resolved the concern through some other control.</li>
<li class="noindent1">They feel resolving an alert would be too expensive, or the fix wouldn’t be compatible with their deployment.</li>
<li class="noindent1">They think Azure is triggering a false positive.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Have a deeper conversation to really understand what’s happening in any of these cases. If the client is ignoring Security Center entirely, I’d be concerned they aren’t properly prioritizing security. Security Center is one of the easier security tools on the market to use, and they should be using it. If they believe they solved an alert some other way, you should confirm that their fix does indeed address the threats implied by the alert. If the customer has done a cost-benefit assessment and decided that the solutions for the flagged risks are too expensive, that can be hard to argue with, but in those cases, be sure the customer understands the exact nature of the threats they are accepting.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, if an alert is a false positive, let the customer know they can click an alert and select <strong class="calibre4">Dismiss</strong> to hide it. They can also disable an entire category of prevention policies within a subscription by going to Security Center, selecting <strong class="calibre4">Security Policy</strong>, clicking a subscription name, clicking <strong class="calibre4">Prevention Policy</strong>, and then toggling any ruleset to <strong class="calibre4">Off</strong>. However, they should be absolutely sure that it’s really a false positive. In that case, they might also consider submitting feedback to Microsoft. To date, I have yet to encounter a legitimate false positive in Security Center’s preventive ruleset.</p>
<h3 class="h1" id="lev184"><strong class="calibre2">Operations Management Suite</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Azure Security Center is built to give IT administrators a view of security-related issues in their services. Although that’s great for seeing a summary of threats in one view, it means that teams need to look elsewhere to review non-security-related events or perform non-security-related administrative tasks. To address the difficulty of managing systems across multiple environments, Microsoft offers Operations Management Suite (OMS), a cloud-based platform that can aggregate logs, alerts, and automation from both on-premises and cloud-hosted systems and services.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em class="calibre7">Microsoft has added many of the security features that were originally exclusive to OMS into Azure Security Center, including the ability to query logs from systems outside of Azure. This gives defenders the ability to use a single blade to monitor their entire environment. However, these features can still be accessed via OMS as well, and both systems utilize the same OMS workspaces.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_169"/>OMS allows users to enable various solutions, or modules, to provide specific capabilities. One of the core solutions is Security and Compliance, which monitors the state of antimalware services on hosts, threats against systems, and patch levels. OMS also has other solutions that can increase security awareness, such as Active Directory health checks, Azure Network Security Group analytics, SQL Server assessments, and Key Vault analytics. There are also non-security-related solutions in OMS, such as the automation component used to enable Azure Automation Hybrid Workers, which you saw in <a href="part0016.html#ch07" class="calibre6">Chapter 7</a>.</p>
<h4 class="h2" id="lev185"><strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre10">Setting Up OMS</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Because OMS ties the management of multiple environments together, it requires some setup. To use OMS to monitor services, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre16">
<li class="noindent1" value="1">Create an OMS workspace at <em class="calibre7"><a href="https://mms.microsoft.com/" class="calibre6">https://mms.microsoft.com/</a></em>.</li>
<li class="noindent1" value="2">Enable any desired solutions in the OMS workspace.</li>
<li class="noindent1" value="3">Enable Log Analytics for any Azure services OMS will monitor.</li>
<li class="noindent1" value="4">Install an agent on any non-Azure servers to be monitored.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">First, the administrator creates a <em class="calibre7">workspace</em>, which is OMS’s equivalent to an Azure subscription. Multiple people can share a workspace, and companies can choose to have more than one workspace if they want to split up the management of different systems to different groups of people.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, the administrator needs to add <em class="calibre7">solutions</em> to their workspace. Each solution represents a different type of log, agent, or service that OMS can use. Within the subscription, there is a <em class="calibre7">gallery</em>, which is represented by a shopping bag icon and contains dozens of available solutions. OMS users can click any solution to get a more detailed description of its capabilities and any associated costs, if it has any, or to enable the solution in their workspace. Workspaces can contain as many solutions as users need. <a href="part0017.html#ch08fig4" class="calibre6">Figure 8-4</a> shows some of the offerings in the gallery.</p>
<p class="indent">Third, service logs need to be forwarded to OMS for any Azure-specific solutions that an administrator enables. For OMS to be able to analyze logs, it needs access to them, but Azure’s logs aren’t automatically made available to OMS. Instead, an administrator with the necessary rights in both the Azure subscription and the OMS workspace must log in to the Azure portal and enable log forwarding for each resource managed in OMS. Although this can be somewhat tedious when first configuring OMS, it allows administrators to select individual instances of services within a subscription for monitoring; this prevents over-sharing of data, allows different services to have logs sent to different workspaces (for example, test services logs go to one workspace while production logs go to another), and prevents OMS from becoming cluttered with logs from resources a customer doesn’t want to track.</p>
<div class="image1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_170"/><a id="ch08fig4" class="calibre6"/><img src="../images/00064.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre3"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em class="calibre7">Figure 8-4: Operations Management Suite gallery</em></p>
<p class="indent">To enable these logs, the administrator performs the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre16">
<li class="noindent1" value="1">Navigates to the service within Azure that corresponds to the OMS solution they enabled.</li>
<li class="noindent1" value="2">Selects an instance of that service and then clicks the <strong class="calibre4">Diagnostics logs</strong> tab.</li>
<li class="noindent1" value="3">Enables the diagnostic log, if it isn’t already on.</li>
<li class="noindent1" value="4">Specifies a name for the log—often the name of the resource.</li>
<li class="noindent1" value="5">Checks the box <strong class="calibre4">Send to Log Analytics</strong>.</li>
<li class="noindent1" value="6">Clicks the <strong class="calibre4">Log Analytics Configure</strong> button and then selects one of the OMS workspaces listed.</li>
<li class="noindent1" value="7">Checks any boxes indicating what type of logs to collect, such as Audit logs.</li>
<li class="noindent1" value="8">Clicks <strong class="calibre4">Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">At this point, logs should be flowing to OMS, which will begin analyzing them and displaying results after a short delay. An example of enabling log forwarding to OMS for a Key Vault instance is shown in <a href="part0017.html#ch08fig5" class="calibre6">Figure 8-5</a>.</p>
<div class="image1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_171"/><a id="ch08fig5" class="calibre6"/><img src="../images/00065.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre3"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em class="calibre7">Figure 8-5: Enabling Log Analytics for a Key Vault resource</em></p>
<p class="indent">The final step to setting up OMS is to enable data collection from non-Azure systems. This includes on-premises servers and VMs running in other cloud providers. For these systems, Azure offers Windows and Linux agent applications that run as a service and forward any relevant data to OMS for analysis and alerting. OMS users can download these agents by clicking the <strong class="calibre4">Settings</strong> button in OMS, selecting <strong class="calibre4">Connected Sources</strong>, and then clicking the <strong class="calibre4">Download agent</strong> button in the Windows Servers and Linux Servers tabs. These pages also provide agent ID values and OMS keys, which are used during the agent installation to direct the logs to the correct workspace.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to agents, OMS users can also download an OMS Gateway application from the Connected Sources page. This application allows agents installed on servers—in a restricted network environment with no outbound internet access—to forward their logs to a central gateway, which then passes the logs on to OMS. You can find more information about the connectivity requirements of OMS at <em class="calibre7"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-oms-gateway/" class="calibre6">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-oms-gateway/</a></em>.</p>
<h4 class="h2" id="lev186"><strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre10">Reviewing Alerts in OMS</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Once fully configured and receiving log data, OMS should begin to display log status on the workspace home page. This is useful to see how many hosts are checking in, but it isn’t the best view for tracking down events. For that, OMS has two other panes: My Dashboard and Log Search.</p>
<p class="indent">The My Dashboard pane allows users to select individual metrics available from the enabled solutions and add them to the dashboard. Users can then rearrange them and opt for different visualizations for the data, such as bar graphs, line graphs, or counts. This way, an OMS user can determine what particular events are important to them and see only relevant data in the portal. Users can also share dashboards or create multiple dashboards using the View Designer page in OMS.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_172"/>Log Search, an aggregate of all incoming data to the OMS workspace, allows users to search for specific events. The search pane uses Microsoft’s Azure Log Analytics Query language, which allows a user to query based on resource, event type, time range, platform, and more. Fortunately for users not interested in learning a new language, OMS offers filter options to the left of the results to further scope the data—much like a consumer might filter product attributes on a shopping website. Users can start with a wildcard search (<span class="codestrong">*</span>) to show all records, then filter them with the GUI, as shown in <a href="part0017.html#ch08fig6" class="calibre6">Figure 8-6</a>.</p>
<div class="image1"><a id="ch08fig6" class="calibre6"/><img src="../images/00066.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre3"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em class="calibre7">Figure 8-6: Log Search and filtering in OMS</em></p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em class="calibre7">Log Search is also accessible within Azure Security Center by clicking <strong class="calibre4">Search</strong> from the left menu bar. OMS and Security Center both contain the same workspaces and events, and they use the same query language, so you should get the same results regardless of how you access Log Search.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Although the OMS portal is a great place to keep an eye on trends across environments, security personnel need to know when an attack occurs, even if they’re away from their screens. For this, OMS has the ability to perform actions when a certain event occurs or a metric goes <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_173"/>outside a specified threshold. These actions include sending emails, triggering a webhook to make an API call to another service, and creating tickets in popular IT Service Management (ITSM) tools like ServiceNow, System Center Service Manager, Provance, and Cherwell.</p>
<p class="indent">To create an alert, an OMS user can create a query in Log Search that matches the desired conditions for the alert. Alternatively, they can click any graph in the dashboard and then click the <strong class="calibre4">Alert</strong> button in the top menu. This will open an alert rule creation window that allows the user to specify the exact conditions of the alert and the actions that should be taken, as shown in <a href="part0017.html#ch08fig7" class="calibre6">Figure 8-7</a>.</p>
<div class="image1"><a id="ch08fig7" class="calibre6"/><img src="../images/00067.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre3"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em class="calibre7">Figure 8-7: Alert creation in OMS</em></p>
<p class="indent">The user creating the rule can specify how critical they deem the alert. They can also set a cool-off period to prevent the rule from triggering continually. Between the custom dashboards, queries, and alerting options, OMS users can stay apprised of events and trends in their environments.</p>
<h3 class="h1" id="lev187"><strong class="calibre2">Secure DevOps Kit</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The Secure DevOps Kit is a group of scripts designed to help developers turn on key security controls in an efficient, consistent way. These scripts were created within Microsoft’s IT organization as a result of considerable research and testing by its cloud security team. The kit is written <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_174"/>in PowerShell and requires the workstation where it is run to have the Azure PowerShell tools already installed. To get the toolkit, open a PowerShell prompt and run the following:</p>
<pre>PS C:\&gt; <span class="codestrong1">Install-Module AzSK -Scope CurrentUser</span></pre>
<p class="indent">Once the toolkit has finished downloading, run the cmdlet <span class="codestrong">Get-AzSKSubscriptionSecurityStatus</span>, specifying a subscription ID. This will examine a number of attributes in the specified subscription, such as the number of subscription administrators, unresolved ASC alerts, use of classic resources, and whether designated security contacts for the subscription have been provided. <a href="part0017.html#ch08list1" class="calibre6">Listing 8-1</a> shows <code>Get-AzSKSubscriptionSecurityStatus</code> running on a subscription.</p>

<p class="indent">This will list the tests being run and the number of tests that pass, fail, or need manual verification, as well as provide a path to the output log. Results are logged to a CSV file, which contains the pass/fail status of each control as well as recommended steps that can be taken to become compliant. For example, if critical alert notifications aren’t enabled, the results will suggest running <code>Set-AzSKAlerts</code> to enable them.</p>
<p class="indent">Next, run the <span class="codestrong">Get-AzSKAzureServicesSecurityStatus</span> cmdlet. This command works just like the <code>Get-AzSKAzureSubscriptionSecurityStatus</code> cmdlet, except instead of validating the security of the subscription’s configuration, it checks the security of each service running inside the subscription. The results are written to the screen and to a CSV file just as they are for the subscription security check.</p>
<p class="indent">Although these one-time checks of Azure settings are a good start, there is a good chance the subscription and its services may become less secure over time. This could happen if an administrator accidently disables a security setting, if new resources are deployed and aren’t set up for monitoring, or if a new security feature is added to Azure but isn’t retroactively applied to existing resources. To handle these cases, the Secure DevOps Kit also offers a Continuous Assurance component.</p>
<p class="indent">Continuous Assurance uses Azure Automation to create a runbook that validates the security of any specified resource groups once a day. The results are stored in an OMS workspace so administrators can track their resources’ security posture over time. To enable Continuous Assurance, run the following:</p>
<pre>PS C:\&gt; <span class="codestrong1">Install-AzSKContinuousAssurance</span> <span class="codestrong1">-SubscriptionId</span> <span class="codestrongitalic">ID</span> <span class="codestrong1">-OMSWorkspaceId</span> <span class="codestrongitalic">Workspace</span> <span class="codestrong1">`</span><br class="calibre5"/>    <span class="codestrong1">-OMSSharedKey</span> <span class="codestrongitalic">Key</span> <span class="codestrong1">-ResourceGroupNames "</span><span class="codestrongitalic">Group1</span><span class="codeitalic">,</span><span class="codestrongitalic">Group2</span><span class="codestrong1">"</span></pre>
<p class="indent">Be sure to specify an existing OMS workspace and its associated access key, as well as any resource groups that should be monitored. Once the command completes, the automation job will take several hours before results are available in OMS.</p>
<p class="indent">Other features available in the Secure DevOps Kit may also be helpful, depending on your client’s environment. For more information, see <em class="calibre7"><a href="https://github.com/azsk/DevOpsKit-docs/" class="calibre6">https://github.com/azsk/DevOpsKit-docs/</a></em>.</p>
<h3 class="h1" id="lev188"><strong class="calibre2">Custom Log Handling</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Both OMS and Security Center are good choices for clients looking for first-party Microsoft solutions to managing and monitoring their services, but these solutions might not be a perfect fit for every customer. Some enterprises may want to integrate logs into other monitoring tools they use already; that way, they’ll have everything in a single place. Or maybe <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_176"/>they’re using a service in a novel way or have threat concerns unique to their business—the kind of events not accounted for in any commercial product—that need to be addressed in a custom solution. Some customers might want to monitor newly released Azure services that don’t yet have corresponding solutions in OMS. And others may have unique regulatory requirements that dictate a long period of log data retention. For these clients, Azure does provide the ability to save logs for just about every service, usually to a storage account.</p>
<p class="indent">Service logs are usually off by default. Users must enable them on a per-resource basis in the Azure portal. This is to save customer expense, because logs are written to storage accounts, which are billed by the amount of space used. The location of this setting differs by service; for services with OMS log forwarding, the option should be on the same Diagnostics Log page. For other services, it’s sometimes labeled Diagnostics, Alerts, Metrics, Logging, or Activity Log.</p>
<p class="indent">On most of these settings blades, there is a checkbox to save the logs to a storage account that, once checked, will display a drop-down menu for selecting the desired storage account—very much like configuring Log Analytics for OMS. For some services, like virtual machines, you first need to view the log in the service’s Activity Log page, click <strong class="calibre4">Export</strong>, and then choose the destination storage account, as shown in <a href="part0017.html#ch08fig8" class="calibre6">Figure 8-8</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">After the logs for various services are being saved to a storage account, users can retrieve them with PowerShell, a storage account library, or any of the numerous storage account client applications discussed in <a href="part0013.html#ch04" class="calibre6">Chapter 4</a>. Many services write the logs as flat files into blob storage, though some use table storage to save their records. Unfortunately, there isn’t a consistent format used by all services, so a developer will need to parse the logs for any services of interest and create a custom solution based on the organization’s needs.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_177"/>Penetration testers should occasionally review the logs before and after carrying out an operation or using a new tool to better understand how much activity is currently being recorded and detected. If you find events that end up in logs but aren’t exposed in Azure Security Center or OMS, make your client aware of this gap and notify Microsoft. You can do so at <em class="calibre7"><a href="https://feedback.azure.com/" class="calibre6">https://feedback.azure.com/</a></em> or through the product support link in the Azure Portal. If your client is a Premier customer, they can submit feedback through their technical account manager.</p>
<h3 class="h1" id="lev189"><strong class="calibre2">Summary</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, we reviewed the various ways clients can configure alerts for security events in Azure, as well as audit their resources to ensure they are following best practices. We started with Azure Security Center, which is a good option for those who want to focus specifically on securing Azure, because it offers both alerts and configuration recommendations for a variety of Azure services. For users wanting to manage multiple environments, we explored Operations Management Suite, which can also alert on security events, but unlike Security Center, it can perform health checks, monitor on-premises servers, and even automate management duties on servers. Next, you saw how the Secure DevOps Kit could verify whether crucial security settings are properly configured for an Azure subscription. Finally, we examined how to retrieve logs from Azure that developers can review by hand or use in custom management tools.</p>

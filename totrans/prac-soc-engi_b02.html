<p class="ChapterIntro">Use this template as a means to write a professional OSINT or social engineering report. Feel free to add or omit sections, although I recommend trying to stay as close to this as you can. Obviously, include phishing or vishing only if you are doing it as part of the engagement. </p>
<p class="right"><em>&lt;DATE&gt;</em></p>
<h2 id="h1-500983b02-0001">Introduction</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst"><em>&lt;Client Name&gt;</em> contracted <em>&lt;you or your business&gt;</em> to perform an information security testing engagement to include<em> &lt;include all that are relevant&gt; </em>phishing, vishing, dumpster diving, open source intelligence gathering, baiting, physical security testing, and <em>&lt;other in-scope tests&gt;</em>. The performance dates were <em>&lt;start date&gt;</em> to <em>&lt;end date&gt;.</em></p>
<h2 id="h1-500983b02-0002"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_188" title="188"/>Executive Summary</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The team performed the following <em>&lt;from intro&gt;</em> tests against <em>&lt;Client Name&gt;</em>. The following outcomes were observed: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>&lt;Finding 1 (interpreted to a meaning conveying business risk)&gt;</em> </li>
<li><em>&lt;Finding 2 (interpreted to a meaning conveying business risk)&gt;</em></li>
<li><em>&lt;Finding 3 (interpreted to a meaning conveying business risk)&gt;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The following outcomes were immediately discovered by the team:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&lt;Positive outcome 1 (i.e., detection)&gt;</em></li>
<li><em>&lt;Positive outcome 2 (i.e., reporting)&gt;</em></li>
<li><em>&lt;Negative outcome 1 (i.e., sensitive information found)&gt;</em></li>
<li><em>&lt;Negative outcome 2 (i.e., discovered another attacker inside)&gt;</em> </li>
</ul>
<p>The assessed level of risk to <em>&lt;Client Name&gt;</em> is <b><i>&lt;LOW | MODERATE | HIGH | CRITICAL&gt;</i></b>. <em>(Note: BOLD the level of risk and put it in all caps.)</em></p>
<h2 id="h1-500983b02-0003">Statement of Work</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Use this section to explain what the work is. This is often best accomplished by copying and pasting all or parts of the actual statement of work in the contract. This is to reiterate what was asked of your team and why you did what you did.</em></p>
<h3 id="h2-500983b02-0001">Scope</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">The scope of the social engineering engagement, including OSINT, phishing, and vishing between <em>&lt;Client Name&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;you or your business&gt;</em> includes <em>&lt;hours of OSINT&gt;</em>, phishing to include <em>&lt;number of scenarios&gt;</em> scenarios of <em>&lt;up to&gt; | &lt;no less than&gt; &lt;number of emails&gt; </em>to be sent during <em>&lt;time frame of engagement (days and times)&gt;</em>, and vishing to include <em>&lt;number of scenarios&gt; </em>scenarios of <em>&lt;up to&gt; | &lt;no less than&gt; &lt;number of phone calls&gt;</em> to be made during <em>&lt;time frame of engagement (days and times)&gt;</em>. </p>
<p>The following items are explicitly in scope:</p>
<ol class="none">
<li><em>&lt;in-scope items&gt;</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The following items are explicitly out of scope:</p>
<ol class="none">
<li><em>&lt;out-of-scope items&gt;</em>  </li>
</ol>
<h3 id="h2-500983b02-0002">Completion Date</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">All work is to be completed by <em>&lt;date&gt;</em>, with a final report and debriefing meeting or call to be provided within 10 working days of the completion date.</p>
<h3 id="h2-500983b02-0003">Location of Work</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst"><em>&lt;Location or locations of work&gt; </em></p>
<p class="BodyContinued"><em>&lt;IP addresses work will be performed from&gt;</em></p>
<h2 id="h1-500983b02-0004"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_189" title="189"/>About <em>&lt;Company Name&gt;</em></h2>
<p class="BodyFirst"><em>&lt;Company Name&gt;</em> is an &lt;<em>industry of company&gt;</em> company headquartered in <em>&lt;City&gt;</em>, <em>&lt;State or Country</em>&gt;, and owned by <em>&lt;owners; if publicly traded, also mention traded under ticker symbol of xxx&gt;</em>. <em>&lt;More specific information about the company&gt;.</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Any mergers and/or acquisitions&gt;</em></p>
<p>The company has numerous physical locations. Sites are in the following locations:</p>
<p><em>&lt;Site 1&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;Site 2&gt;</em></p>
<p><em>&lt;The targeted Company&gt; </em>has instituted a standard email address format of <em>firstname.lastname@&lt;company domain&gt;.</em></p>
<h2 id="h1-500983b02-0005">Tools and Methodologies</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Talk about which tools you used and how you analyzed what you found. Don’t get too deep into what you actually found yet.</em></p>
<h2 id="h1-500983b02-0006">Metrics</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst"><em>This is where you do a certain level of mathematic or numeric analysis to help the client understand how the findings add up and where to improve. It doesn’t have to be overly complicated, but giving ratios, percentages, or even charts or graphs can be incredibly valuable and will have the client hiring you again.</em></p>

<h3 id="h2-500983b02-0006">Severity Key</h3>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Critical</b></p>
<ol class="none">
<li>These risks carry potentially catastrophic consequences for the organization, involving major downtime and large amounts of highly sensitive or personal data.</li>
</ol>
<p class="ListHead"><b>High</b></p>
<ol class="none">
<li>These risks could cause costly or serious downtime, harm, or disruption to operations. The barrier to entry for exploitation and impact is low. These risks have a high impact and could involve sensitive data or regulated data, though in lesser amounts than the critical risks.</li>
</ol>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Moderate</b></p>
<ol class="none">
<li>These items could cause some disruption or issues within the client organization, but no major downtime. They could involve gaining access to systems that could be used to pivot to other systems or facilities. These could involve nonpublic data that isn’t particularly sensitive.</li>
</ol>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Low</b></p>
<ol class="none">
<li>These items pose little risk to the client. They could have fringe-case dependencies, like local physical access, or require another exploitation vector to have already been accomplished. These risks involve minimal disruption if successful.</li>
</ol>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Informational</b></p>
<ol class="none">
<li>These pose no current risk but do not adhere to best practices or may become risky later.</li>
</ol>

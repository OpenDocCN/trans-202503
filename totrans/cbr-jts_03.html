</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="ChapterIntro">In this chapter, we’ll explore the concept of <em>xenophobic security</em>—or security based on a distrust of outsiders—and how it can be applied as a type of anti-privilege protection domain. To illustrate this idea, we’ll consider the hostile environment that shinobi had to navigate.</p>&#13;
<p>Shinobi trying to infiltrate villages and gather information in plain sight faced a ubiquitous challenge: the pervasive xenophobia of the medieval Japanese. The isolation of the country’s villages gave rise to unique dialects, hairstyles, clothing, and other customs that made each community its own social ecosystem.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c03-noteref-33" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-33">1</a></sup> The small populations in these remote locales meant everyone usually knew everyone else and an outsider obviously did not fit in.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c03-noteref-34" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-34">2</a></sup> </p>&#13;
<p>As outsiders, the shinobi were routinely viewed with suspicion and followed. They could not move freely around town, and they were often <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="26" id="Page_26"/>prevented from renting rooms and purchasing food. Certainly, villagers would not share information with them. The community’s xenophobia reduced the shinobi to anti-privileged status. </p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-500549c03-0001">Understanding Anti-Privilege</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">To grasp the significance of anti-privilege, let’s first examine the concept of <em>privilege</em>, which in cybersecurity refers to the permissions a user has to perform actions, such as reading or deleting a file. Modern computer systems have a ringed architecture with different levels of privilege: </p>&#13;
<ol class="none">&#13;
<li><b>ring4</b> Default (unprivileged) </li>&#13;
<li><b>ring3</b> Normal user (least privileged) </li>&#13;
<li><b>ring2</b> Superuser (admin) </li>&#13;
<li><b>ring1</b> Root (elevated privilege) </li>&#13;
<li><b>ring0</b> Kernel (system) </li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p>For example, a common villager (least privileged) or a cat (unprivileged) may be able to leave the town any time they want. A village chief with elevated privilege has the additional permissions to lock the town gates at will. However, a foreigner suspected of mischief (anti-privilege) could have less permission than a stray cat (unprivileged) and therefore would not be allowed to leave the village. </p>&#13;
<p>This distinction between anti-privileged and unprivileged status is important. In some computer systems, actions such as logging out are considered unprivileged and are given by default to actors in all rings. Untrustworthy processes/users can use these default unprivileged capabilities to enable more malicious actions or operate somewhat freely to further more sophisticated goals. On the other hand, by denying an anti-privileged process from logging out, you may prevent it from clearing its session history or evidence of its existence in the first place. Consider if computer systems could adopt a ring5 (anti-privilege) security control. Using our village as an example, one could speculatively force a suspected shinobi to submit to searches and interrogation before being allowed to leave the village. In this way, the village could catch thieves and spies. Furthermore, by making infiltrators’ jobs that much more risky and expensive, villages undoubtedly deterred hostile activity.</p>&#13;
<p>To infiltrate such a xenophobic village, a shinobi first had to memorize and practice a range of culturally distinct disguises, becoming fluent in the style of dress, dialect, grooming techniques, monetary customs, and social mores unique to the location. </p>&#13;
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="27" id="Page_27"/>When the cultural disguise was mastered, the shinobi still needed to have a convincing reason to be in the village; usually this was job related. The <em>Ninpiden</em> describes how shinobi could appropriate a generic cover story, perhaps claiming to be a monk on a spiritual journey, a merchant, a beggar, or even a samurai traveling on orders from his lord. (Though also recognized by villagers as an outsider, a samurai did not incur the same level of distrust as a potential fugitive or bandit.) </p>&#13;
<p>While in disguise around people of the same job, class, or caste, shinobi were advised to demonstrate enough knowledge to appear believable in the profession but also to act dumb and in need of help to perform common tasks. Feigning ignorance served to deceive a target about the shinobi’s true intelligence while flattering the target’s own, causing them to lower their guard and offer information freely. The <em>Ninpiden</em> lists specific targets shinobi should attempt to win over with these tactics, such as local deputies, magistrates, doctors, monks, and others who may work in the presence of the local lord or authority. These targets typically had information valuable to the mission.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c03-noteref-35" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-35">3</a></sup> </p>&#13;
<p>Note that the social hierarchies of the medieval Japanese village resemble the privilege ring structure in modern computer systems, or even the layered segmentation of computer networks in which the outside layers, like a DMZ, are the least trusted. Likewise, normal villagers (the least privileged) would be unable to interact with the lord who is at the center, or ring0. </p>&#13;
<p>We can apply the way shinobi identified likely targets to a cybersecurity context. Just as shinobi targeted those who were, metaphorically, closer to ring0 or who had access to ring0, so will modern threat actors target privileged classes of systems/users. Thus, defenders should consider what the computer equivalents of such high-status individuals as monks and magistrates are in their systems. Furthermore, you should consider what disguises a modern threat actor might use to approach the more privileged systems/users.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-500549c03-0002">The Problem with Interoperability and Universal Standards</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Whether they consciously think about it or not, <em>interoperability</em> is a top priority for technology consumers: people expect their devices, apps, systems, and software to work seamlessly with new and old versions and across different platforms, as well as interchangeably with other makes and models. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the Internet <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="28" id="Page_28"/>Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Internet Society (ISOC), and other governing bodies have established widely agreed-upon standards for how technology is designed and should operate and integrate. </p>&#13;
<p>These efforts have produced many of the ISO standards, Request for Comments (RFC), and other interoperability protocols that make computers more accessible, not to mention easier to build, manage, diagnose, repair, program, network, and run. A prime example is the Plug and Play (PnP) standard introduced in 1995, which directs a host system to detect and accept any foreign device plugged into it via USB, PCI, PCMCIA, PCIe, FireWire, Thunderbolt, or other means and then autoconfigure, load, install, and interface automatically.</p>&#13;
<p>Unfortunately, when the goals are to establish functionality and maintain its operability, security is almost never a priority. In fact, the PnP standard—which facilitates the trust and acceptance of unfamiliar entities—was built to the exact opposite of the xenophobic security standard held by the medieval Japanese. For example, an unfamiliar system can connect to a network as an outsider and request an IP address from Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), ask for directions from the local router, query the authoritative DNS server for the names of other devices, and obtain local information from Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), Server Message Block (SMB), Web Proxy Auto Discovery (WPAD), and other protocols designed to ease the burden of compatibility. You plug the system into the network and it works, demonstrating behavior users expect and desire. However, the cybersecurity industry would benefit from being more “xenophobic” in its networking protocols.</p>&#13;
<p>To mitigate weaknesses resulting from PnP-like accessibility, security controls such as Network Access Control (NAC) and Group Policy Objects (GPO) have been introduced. On host systems, these technologies safeguard against potentially malicious foreign devices that physically connect to internal networks or systems. </p>&#13;
<p>NACs typically lock down the DHCP, assigning unrecognized computers to guest IP subnets or unprivileged VLANs. This allows foreign systems to connect to the internet for general access but segments them from the rest of the trusted network. Such behavior is especially desirable for conference rooms and lobbies so that external business partners and vendors can operate without exposing the network to threats. </p>&#13;
<p>GPO on local hosts enforces what types of devices—external hard drives, USBs, media readers, and the like—can be configured and installed on a system. GPO can even whitelist known applications within an organization while simultaneously blocking all unfamiliar software from downloading or installing on the host system.</p>&#13;
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="29" id="Page_29"/>However, these security controls are notable exceptions. From RJ45 Ethernet jacks using the EIA/TIA-561 and Yost standards to packet-based networking using the IEEE 802 standards—and everything in between—most technologies are built with transparent, widely known, default standards that ensure quick and easy use across foreign systems and networks, leaving them vulnerable to unauthorized rogue systems that may conduct network discovery, reconnaissance, sniffing, and communication.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-500549c03-0003">Developing Unique Characteristics for Your Environment</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Having unique properties and characteristics in your IT inventory will help to distinguish your assets from rogue assets that may enter your environment and even protect your network from compromise. These characteristics are observable through inspection or analysis, but their use should not be publicly disclosed, as such disclosure would defeat the countermeasures. Most elements within modern IT systems and software are configurable, and such configuration changes effectively create a xenophobic IT model in your systems.</p>&#13;
<p>Recently introduced commercial products that use a zero-trust model can help make your network or systems “xenophobic” to unfamiliar systems, software, and devices through a combination of technical protocols and distrust. Strict whitelists and authentication/authorization procedures can achieve similar results, but a proper solution would introduce a computer version of “dialects”—settings, customs, and other unique characteristics that deviate from universal computing standards. Systems or devices connecting to your internal network would need to be “indoctrinated” to the unique culture of your organization, while unindoctrinated servers, components, networking devices, and protocols would distrust or reject the unfamiliar foreign agent and alert the security team to its presence.</p>&#13;
<p>With some creativity and engineering, these cultural computer identifiers could be implemented at any layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model (application, presentation, session, transport, networking, data link, physical) to identify network outsiders and provide an additional layer of defense against adversaries. Whether it’s transposing certain wires in hidden adapters of RJ45 jacks, expecting secret handshakes (SYN, SYN ACK, ACK-PUSH) at the TCP/IP level, or using reserved bits in the Ethernet header, a xenophobic solution should be modular, customizable, and unique per instance.</p>&#13;

<h2><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="30" id="Page_30"/>Castle Theory Thought Exercise</h2>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Consider the scenario in which you’re the ruler of a medieval castle with valuable assets within. You notice that one of the local fishermen, who sells fish to your cooks, preserves the fish in an unfamiliar fashion and has a strange dialect. When asked about his unique storage methods, he claims he does it that way because the fish tastes better. He doesn’t have a surname you recognize.</p>&#13;
<p>What culturally unique identifiers could you use to determine whether the fisherman is an outsider, and how might you apply that test? If the fisherman claimed he was born in your village but temporarily moved away, how would you verify his story? If you couldn’t verify his story and suspected him of being a spy, how would you manage the threat without exiling or executing a potentially innocent fisherman? To answer these questions, you’ll need to consider three scenarios: the fisherman is indeed a spy, the fisherman is not a spy, and the fisherman’s purpose is impossible to know. You can ask a partner to play the part of the strange fisherman by secretly choosing one of the roles beforehand, or you can play both roles of interrogator and fisherman in your head. </p>&#13;
<p>This exercise helps you think deeply about asset identification using xenophobic mental models while avoiding technical discussions of computer standards and inventory control. While the scenario is fictitious, shinobi likely disguised themselves as fishermen sometimes, as such a cover would give them an excuse to loiter for hours, chat with locals, and perform reconnaissance on targets. </p>&#13;

<h2 id="h1-500549c03-0004">Recommended Security Controls and Mitigations</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Where relevant, the following recommendations are presented with an applicable security control from the NIST 800-53 standard. Each should be evaluated with the concept of xenophobic security in mind.</p>&#13;
<ol class="decimal">&#13;
<li value="1">Inspect systems to determine whether their specifications or requirements deviate from the previously agreed-upon baseline configuration. [CM-2: Baseline Configuration]</li>&#13;
<li value="2">Maintain documentation of all information systems in your organization so you can more readily identify foreign systems in your environment. [CM-8: Information System Inventory]</li>&#13;
<li value="3">Use encrypted information, embedded data, special data types, or metadata (for example, padding all packets to be a certain size) as special identifiers in communications so that filters can <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="31" id="Page_31"/>identify and restrict unfamiliar traffic. [AC-4: Information Flow Enforcement; SA-4: Acquisition Process]</li>&#13;
<li value="4">Restrict the implementation and knowledge of xenophobic identifiers to newly acquired systems and devices. [SA-4: Acquisition Process]</li>&#13;
<li value="5">Embed xenophobic inspection as a security control for identifying and authenticating systems and devices in your organization. [IA-3: Device Identification and Authentication]</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-500549c03-0005">Debrief</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">This chapter described the historically xenophobic environment for shinobi that required the investment of time and effort, as well as advanced techniques, to perform preparatory reconnaissance using open disguise tactics before actual target reconnaissance could begin. You learned the concept of anti-privilege and how to create unique internal characteristics to identify rogue assets or users in your environment. Now you may be able to identify key resources or people who are likely targets in your environment that you perhaps hadn’t considered as attack vectors from previous threat-modeling exercises, and you can then consider the systems or accounts that work closely with these potential targets. </p>&#13;
<p>However, by using the correct insignia, clothing, hairstyle, accent, and other characteristics, shinobi could evade the xenophobic inspections detailed in this chapter. Therefore, in the next chapter, we’ll explore the matched-pair security technique historically used by Japanese lords to detect shinobi who might otherwise infiltrate their fortification by using a disguise. </p>&#13;

    A breadboard lets you quickly test new ideas and experiment with different components
    to see the result, but it isn’t a permanent solution. Components can easily fall
    out, and there can be loose wires all over the breadboard. When you want to use
    a circuit for a long time without changing it, it’s better to solder the circuit
    to a *circuit board*. Soldering is kind of like gluing: you melt a material called
    *solder* onto the component legs so the components stick to the circuit board.
    A circuit board has holes like a breadboard, and when you solder components to
    it, they become connected by plates of copper.'

- en: 'In this chapter, you learned a very useful skill: soldering. This means you
    can make permanent circuits for your projects without worrying that they’ll fall
    apart. And with a little practice at desoldering, you can take projects apart
    on purpose, too.'

- en: In [Chapter 7](ch07.xhtml#ch07), I’ll introduce you to the transistor, the photoresistor,
    and the potentiometer. These are some really exciting components that you can
    use to make your circuit come alive and respond to its surroundings. For example,
    I’ll show you how to create a circuit that tells you when the sun rises in the
    morning!

- en: Our goal in writing this book is to provide a resource that introduces Ghidra
    to both current and future reverse engineers. In the hands of a skilled reverse
    engineer, Ghidra streamlines the analysis process and allows users to customize
    and extend its capabilities to suit their individual needs and improve their workflows.
    Ghidra is also very accessible to new reverse engineers, particularly with its
    included decompiler that can help them more clearly understand the relationships
    between high-level language and disassembly listings as they begin exploring the
    world of binary analysis.

- en: Writing a book about Ghidra is a challenging undertaking. Ghidra is a complex
    open source reverse engineering tool suite that is continually evolving. Our words
    describe a moving target, as the Ghidra community continues to improve and extend
    its capabilities. As with many new open source projects, Ghidra has begun its
    public life with a rapid string of evolutionary releases. A primary goal while
    writing this book has been to ensure that as Ghidra evolves, the book’s content
    continues to provide readers with a wide and deep foundation of knowledge to understand
    and effectively utilize current and future Ghidra versions to address their reverse
    engineering challenges. As much as possible, we have tried to keep the book version-agnostic.
    Fortunately, new releases of Ghidra are well-documented, with detailed listings
    of changes that provide version-specific guidance should you encounter any differences
    between the book and your version of Ghidra.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is the first comprehensive book about Ghidra. It is intended to be
    an all-encompassing resource for reverse engineering with Ghidra. It provides
    introductory content to bring new explorers to the reverse engineering world,
    advanced content to extend the worldview of experienced reverse engineers, and
    examples for rookie and veteran Ghidra developers alike to continue to extend
    Ghidra’s extensive capabilities and become contributors to the Ghidra community.

- en: This book is intended for aspiring and experienced software reverse engineers.
    If you don’t already have reverse engineering experience, that’s okay, as the
    early chapters provide the background material necessary to introduce you to reverse
    engineering and enable you to explore and analyze binaries with Ghidra. Experienced
    reverse engineers who want to add Ghidra to their toolkits might choose to move
    quickly through the first two parts to gain a basic understanding of Ghidra and
    then jump to specific chapters of interest. Experienced Ghidra users and developers
    may choose to focus on the later chapters so that they can create new Ghidra extensions
    and can apply their experience and knowledge to contribute new content to the
    Ghidra project.

    disassembly, reverse engineering, and the Ghidra project. [Part II](part02.xhtml#part02)
    covers basic Ghidra usage. [Part III](part03.xhtml#part03) demonstrates ways you
    can customize and automate Ghidra to make it work for you. [Part IV](part04.xhtml#part04)
    takes a deeper dive into explaining specific types of Ghidra modules and supporting
    concepts. [Part V](part05.xhtml#part05) demonstrates how Ghidra can be applied
    to some real-world situations a reverse engineer is likely to encounter.

			</header>
			<p class="BodyFirst"><span class="DropCap">M</span>artin M. Broadwell defines four stages of competence in <em>Teaching for Learning</em>: unconscious incompetence, conscious incompetence, conscious competence, and unconscious competence. Specifically, <em>unconscious incompetence</em> means you are unable to perform a task correctly and are unaware of the gap. <em>Conscious incompetence</em> means you are unable to perform a task correctly but are aware of the gap. <em>Conscious competence</em> means you are capable of performing a task with effort. Finally, <em>unconscious competence</em> means you are capable of performing a task effortlessly.</p>
			<p>All engineers start out consciously or unconsciously incompetent. Even if you know everything about software engineering (an impossible task), you’re going to have to learn company-specific processes and rules. You’re also going to have to learn practical skills like those covered in this book. Your goal is to get to conscious competence as quickly as possible.</p>
			<p>
				The bulk of this chapter discusses learning on your own and getting help. Learning outside of school is a skill; we offer some suggestions for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_10" title="10"/>developing an independent learning habit. We also provide tips for balancing between asking for help too much and not enough. The chapter finishes by discussing impostor syndrome and the Dunning–Kruger effect, which can cause new engineers to feel under- or overconfident and limit their growth. We explain how to detect and combat both of these extremes. Practicing independent learning and asking effective questions while avoiding traps of self-doubt and overconfidence will get you to conscious competence quickly.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-501836c02-0001">Learning to Learn</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Learning will help you become a competent engineer and flourish in the years to come. The field of software engineering is constantly evolving; whether you are a new grad or a seasoned veteran, if you’re not learning, you’re falling behind.</p>
			<p>This section is a digest of various approaches to learning. Don’t try to do everything that’s listed in this chapter at the same time! That’s a recipe for burnout. Guard your personal time—continued growth is important, but spending every waking moment on work is unhealthy. Choose from the list based on your circumstances and natural inclinations.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c02-0001">Front-Load Your Learning</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Spend your first few months on the job learning how everything works. This will help you participate in design discussions, on-call rotations, operational issues, and code reviews. Front-loaded learning will be uncomfortable—you’ll want to ship software, and taking time to read documentation and fiddle with tools will slow you down. Don’t worry; everyone expects you to spend time ramping up. Front-loaded learning is an investment, one that is so valuable that many companies explicitly design a learning curriculum for new hires. Facebook, famously, has a six-week “boot camp” for new engineers.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c02-0002"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_11" title="11"/>Learn by Doing</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Front-loaded learning does not mean sitting around reading documentation all day. We learn a little by reading and a lot by doing. You should write and ship code. Shipping code for the first time is scary—what if you break something?—but managers won’t usually put you in a situation where you can do serious damage (though sometimes new hires do high-risk work when there’s no alternative). Do your best to understand the impact of your work, and act with an appropriate level of caution. You can be less cautious, and thus faster, writing a unit test than you can be altering indexes on a high-traffic database.</p>

					<h2>The Day Chris Deleted All of the Code</h2>
					<p class="BoxBodyFirst">At one of Chris’s first internships, he was working on a project with a senior engineer. Chris finished some changes and needed to get them deployed. The senior engineer showed him how to check code into the revision control system, CVS. Chris followed the instructions, blindly running through steps that involved branching, tagging, and merging. Afterward, he continued with the rest of his day and went home. The next morning, Chris strolled in cheerfully and greeted everyone. They did their best to respond in kind, but they were low. When Chris asked what was up, they informed him that he had managed to corrupt the entire CVS repository. All of the company’s code had been lost. They had been up the entire night desperately trying to recover what they could and were eventually able to get most of the code back (except for Chris’s commits and a few others). Chris was pretty shaken by the whole thing. His manager pulled him aside and told him not to worry: Chris had done the right thing working with the senior engineer. Mistakes happen. Every engineer has some version of a story like this. Do your best, and try to understand what you’re doing, but know that these things happen.</p>

			</aside>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_12" title="12"/>Mistakes are unavoidable. Being a software engineer is hard, and we’re all expected to fail sometimes. Everyone knows and expects this. It’s your manager’s and team’s job to maintain safety nets to make these failures nonfatal. If and when you fail, don’t beat yourself up: write down lessons learned, and move on.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c02-0003">Experiment with Code</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Run experiments to learn how code truly works. Documentation goes out-of-date. Coworkers forget things. Experiments are safe since you can run them outside of production, and nonproduction experiments allow for more invasive techniques. For example, you might know that a method is invoked but be unable to determine how it’s reached. Experiment by throwing an exception, printing a stack trace, or attaching a debugger to see the call path.</p>
			<p>Debuggers are your best friend when experimenting. You can use them to pause running code and see running threads, stack traces, and variable values. Attach a debugger, trigger an event, and step through the code to see how the code processes the event.</p>
			<p>Although debuggers are powerful, sometimes the easiest way to understand a behavior is a few well-placed log lines or print statements. You are probably familiar with this method; just be aware that in complex scenarios, particularly with multithreaded applications, print debugging may be misleading. Operating systems will buffer writes to standard output, delaying what you see in the console, and multiple threads writing to standard output will interleave their messages.</p>
			<p>One silly but surprisingly useful technique is to add a distinctive print statement at the beginning of the program’s execution so you can easily tell if you are running your modified program instead of the original. You’ll save yourself hours of chasing mysterious behaviors that come down to the unmodified program being invoked instead of the one you are changing.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c02-0004"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_13" title="13"/>Read</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Spend a portion of each week reading. There are many different sources: team documentation, design documents, code, ticket backlogs, books, papers, and technical sites. Don’t try to read everything all at once. Start with team documentation and design documents. These will give you a broad overview of how things fit together. Pay special attention to discussions on trade-offs and context. You can then take a deep dive into subsystems that are relevant to your first few tasks.</p>
			<p>
				As Ron Jeffries says, “Code never lies. Comments sometimes do<span class="ColorText" style="color:#14171A"/>” (<a class="LinkURL" href="https://ronjeffries.com/articles/020-invaders-70ff/i-77/">https://ronjeffries.com/articles/020-invaders-70ff/i-77/</a>). Read code—it doesn’t always match the design document! Not just your codebase: read high-quality open source code, particularly libraries you use. Don’t read code front to back like a novel: use your IDE to navigate through the codebase. Diagram control flow and states for key operations. Dig into the code’s data structures and algorithms. Pay attention to edge case handling. Keep an eye out for idioms and style—learn the “local dialect.”</p>
			<p>
				Pending work is tracked in <em>tickets</em> or <em>issues</em>. Read through team tickets to see what everyone is working on and what is coming up. The backlog is a good place to find newbie tickets, too. Old tickets fall into three broad categories: no longer relevant, useful but minor, and important but too large to tackle at the moment. Figure out which of these categories the tickets you are looking at fall into.</p>
			<p>Published and online resources complement each other. Books and papers are great for going deep into a subject. They are reliable but more dated. Online resources such as Twitter, blogs, and newsletters are the opposite: less trustworthy but great for keeping up with trends. Just remember to pump the brakes before implementing the latest ideas from Hacker News: it’s good to be boring (more on this in Chapter 3).</p>
			<p>Join a reading group to keep up with research in academia and industry. Some companies have internal reading groups—ask around. If your company does not, consider starting one. You can also join a local Papers We Love chapter; these groups read and discuss computer science papers regularly.</p>

					<h2><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_14" title="14"/>Learning to Read Code</h2>
					<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Early in his career, Dmitriy was handed a legacy Java application and asked to “figure it out.” He was the only person on the team who was even moderately comfortable with Java, and his manager wanted to make some changes. The source code was full of . . . peculiarities. All the variables had names like <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>. To make things worse, an <code>a</code> in one function would be a <code>d</code> in another. There was no source control history, no tests. The original developer had long since left. Needless to say, it was a minefield.</p>
					<p>Every time Dmitriy needed to change anything in the codebase, he blocked out all the distractions and carefully read the code, renamed variables, traced the logic, sketched things on paper, experimented. It was slow going. Dmitriy grew to appreciate the codebase. It was doing complex things. He was a little in awe of whoever wrote this thing: to keep all this in their head without sensible variable names! Eventually, over lunch Dmitriy expressed this tempered admiration. His colleague looked at him as if he’d grown a second head. “Dmitriy, we don’t have the original source code. You are working on the output of a decompiler. No one in their right mind would write code that way!” We don’t recommend this as a way to learn to read code; but, boy, did that experience teach Dmitriy to go slowly, read for comprehension, and never trust variable names.</p>

			<h3 id="h2-501836c02-0005">Watch Presentations</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">You can learn a lot from a good presentation. Start with recorded video presentations from the past—both internal company talks and external YouTube videos. Watch tutorials, tech talks, and conference presentations. Ask around to find good content. You can usually watch videos at 1.5 or even 2x speed to save time, but do not watch passively. Take notes to help with retention, and follow up on any unfamiliar concepts or terms.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_15" title="15"/>Go to <em>brown bags</em> and tech talks if your company offers them. These informal presentations are hosted on-site, so they’re easy to get to. They’re also internal to your company, so you’ll get really relevant information.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c02-0006">Attend Meetups and Conferences (Sparingly)</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Conferences and meetups are good for networking and discovering new ideas. They are worth attending occasionally, but don’t overdo it. The signal-to-noise ratio—the ratio of relevant content to all content—is often low, and many presentations are available online afterward.</p>
			<p>There are roughly three types of conferences: academic conferences, grassroots interest group gatherings, and vendor showcases. Academic conferences have great content, but reading papers and going to smaller, more focused get-togethers is usually better. Interest-based conferences are great for getting practical tips and meeting experienced practitioners; check out a few. Vendor conferences are the biggest and most visible. They are marketing vehicles for large tech companies and not great for learning. They are fun to attend with your coworkers, but more than one per year is likely a waste of time. Ask around to find the best ones. Keep in mind that some employers will pay for the tickets, travel, and lodging.</p>

					<h2>Crashing the Academic Party</h2>
					<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Years ago, Dmitriy and his colleague Peter Alvaro were struggling to make their data warehouse perform and thought distributing the aggregation tasks to a cluster of commodity servers was the way to go. During their research, Peter found Google’s recently released MapReduce paper. The mighty Google was doing what Peter and Dmitriy were proposing! They found more interesting papers and wanted to find people to talk to about them. Dmitriy discovered that the UC Berkeley database group hosted lunches that were technically open to the public. Peter and Dmitriy became regulars (they <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_16" title="16"/>were careful not to eat the free pizza until all the students had their fill). They could even occasionally contribute to the conversation!</p>
					<p>Their learning shifted into high gear. Eventually, Peter stayed for good—he enrolled in the Berkeley PhD program and is now a professor at UC Santa Cruz. Dmitriy, too, jumped to grad school. The expensive data warehouse was replaced by Hadoop, an open source distributed aggregation system, two years after they left.</p>
					<p>If you start feeling that you are no longer learning, check the local university. They have a ton of programs that are open to the public. Expand your circle and get exposed to new ideas. Going to grad school is optional.</p>

			<h3 id="h2-501836c02-0007">Shadow and Pair with Experienced Engineers</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Shadowing</em> is following another person as they perform a task. The shadower is an active participant: they take notes and ask questions. Shadowing a senior engineer is a great way to learn a new skill. To get the most out of it, set up time before and after the shadowing session for planning and retrospection.</p>
			<p>
				Reverse roles when you are ready. Have a senior engineer shadow you. Like you, they should provide feedback. They will also act as a safety net if things go wrong. This is a gentle way to ease into scary situations like interviewing.<em> </em></p>
			<p><em>Pair programming</em> is also a great way to learn. Two engineers write code together, taking turns doing the typing. It takes some getting used to, but it’s one of the fastest ways to learn from each other. Advocates of this technique also claim that it raises code quality. If your teammates are willing, we highly recommend trying it. Pair programming isn’t just for junior engineers, either. Teammates of all levels can benefit from it.<em> </em></p>
			<p>
				Some companies also encourage shadowing nonengineering roles. Shadowing customer support and sales demos is an eye-opening way to learn about your customers. Write down and share your observations. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_17" title="17"/>Work with your manager and senior engineers to prioritize ideas inspired by the experience.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c02-0008">Experiment with Side Projects</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Working on side projects will expose you to new technologies and ideas. You can skip the “software engineering stuff” (testing, operations, code reviews, and so on) when you’re working on your own. Ignoring these aspects lets you learn new technologies quickly; just don’t forget about the “real” stuff at work.</p>
			<p>You can also participate in open source projects. Most projects welcome contributions. This is a great way to learn and build professional connections. You might even find future jobs through open source communities. Keep in mind that these projects are often run by volunteers. Don’t expect the same turnaround speed you get at work. Sometimes people will get busy and disappear for a bit.</p>
			<p>Don’t choose a project based on what you think you need to learn. Find problems you are interested in solving, and solve those problems using the tools you want to learn. A goal that intrinsically motivates you will keep you engaged longer, and you’ll learn more.</p>
			<p>Companies have rules about outside work. Ask for your company’s policy. Don’t use company resources (your company laptop) to work on side projects. Don’t work on side projects at work. Avoid side projects that compete with your company. Clarify whether you can contribute to open source at work or at home. Some companies will want you to contribute only under special work accounts. Others will want you to use personal accounts only. Understand whether you retain ownership over your side projects. Ask your manager if you need to get approvals. Getting clarity will save you frustration in the long run.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-501836c02-0002">Asking Questions</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">All engineers should ask questions—it’s a critical part of learning. New engineers worry about bothering teammates and try to figure everything out <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_18" title="18"/>themselves instead. This is slow and inefficient. Asking questions effectively will help you learn quickly without irritating others. Use these three steps: do research, ask clear questions, and time your questions appropriately.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c02-0009">Do Your Research</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Try to find the answer yourself. Even if your colleagues know the answer, put in the effort—you’ll learn more. If you don’t find the answer, your research will still be your starting point when you ask for help.</p>
			<p>Don’t just search the internet. Information lives in documentation, wikis, READMEs, source code, and bug trackers. If your question is about code, try turning it into a unit test that demonstrates the problem. It’s possible your question has been asked before: check the mailing list or chat group archives. The information you gather will lead to ideas that you can test. If you can’t find any leads, try to work it out yourself by experimenting. Keep track of where you looked, what you did, why you did it, what happened, and what you learned.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c02-0010">Timebox</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Limit how long you research a question. Set the limit before you start your research to encourage discipline and prevent diminishing returns (research will eventually stop being productive). Consider when you need to know the answer, and then leave enough time to ask a question, get an answer, and act on what you learn.</p>
			<p>Once you reach the end of your timebox, ask for help. Only exceed the timebox if you are making good progress. If you go past your first timebox, set another. If you are still not sure of the answer after the second timebox, cut your losses and ask for help. Stopping takes discipline and practice—hold yourself accountable.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c02-0011">Show Your Work</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Describe what you know when asking a question. Don’t just share your raw notes. Outline what you’ve tried and discovered succinctly. This <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_19" title="19"/>signals that you have spent time trying to figure out the problem yourself. It also gives others a starting point for their answer.</p>
			<p>This is a poor way to ask a question:</p>
			<blockquote class="blockquote trade">
				<p class="Blockquote">Hey Alice,</p>
				<p class="Blockquote">Any idea why testKeyValues is failing in TestKVStore? It really slows down our builds to rerun this.</p>
				<p class="Blockquote">Thanks!</p>
				<p class="Blockquote">Pankaj</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>This gives Alice little to go on. It sounds vaguely like Pankaj is blaming Alice for something, which is probably not what he intended. It’s a little lazy. Compare this with the following:</p>
			<blockquote class="blockquote trade">
				<p class="Blockquote">Hey Alice,</p>
				<p class="Blockquote">I’m having trouble figuring out why testKeyValues is failing in TestKVStore (in the DistKV repo). Shaun pointed me your way. I’m hoping you can help.</p>
				<p class="Blockquote">The test fails for me about every third execution; it seems random. I tried running it in isolation, and it’s still failing, so I don’t think it’s an interaction between tests. Shaun ran the test in a loop on his machine but was unable to reproduce it. I don’t see anything obvious in the source code to explain the failure. It seems like some kind of race condition. Any thoughts?</p>
				<p class="Blockquote">There is no terrible urgency around this as I’m told this is unlikely to be affecting production. Still, the flapping test costs us 20–30 minutes every time this happens, so I’d love to figure out how to fix it. I’ve attached logs that show failures and all of my current environment settings, just in case.</p>
				<p class="Blockquote">Thanks!</p>
				<p class="Blockquote">Pankaj</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_20" title="20"/>In the second example, Pankaj gives some context, describes the problem, tells Alice what he’s already tried, and asks for help. He also notes both the impact and the level of urgency. It is succinct but has detailed information attached so Alice doesn’t need to hunt for it. Alice will help Pankaj out. She will also remember that Pankaj is thorough. Requests like this will build Pankaj’s credibility in the eyes of his colleagues.</p>
			<p>It takes more effort to write the second message. It’s worth it. Put in the work.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c02-0012">Don’t Interrupt</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Just like you, others are trying to get things done; they need to focus. When they’re in the zone, don’t interrupt them. Even if the question is easy. Even if you know they know the answer. Even if you’re blocked. Unless there is a critical issue, really, don’t interrupt them.</p>
			<p>Companies have different conventions to signal “Don’t interrupt.” Headphones, ear plugs, or earmuffs are universal. There’s some confusion about “lounge spaces.” Some consider working somewhere other than their desk sacrosanct—they don’t want to be found. Others interpret engineers in shared spaces as “available to interrupt.” Make sure you understand your company’s convention!</p>
			<p>Walking up and talking to someone forces them to respond. Even if they just reply that they’re busy, you’ve already interrupted and caused them to lose focus. You’re not stuck if the person you need is busy. You need to find an asynchronous way to communicate.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c02-0013">Prefer Multicast, Asynchronous Communication</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">In networking, <em>multicasting</em> means sending a message to a group instead of an individual destination. <em>Asynchronous</em> means a message that can be processed later, rather than requiring an immediate response. These concepts apply to human communication, too.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_21" title="21"/>Post questions so that multiple people can respond (multicast) at their own pace (asynchronous). Do this in a way that’s visible to everyone so it’s apparent when you’ve been helped. The answer will also be discoverable, so others can find the discussion later.</p>
			<p>This usually means using a group mailing list or group chat (for example, Dmitriy’s company has a #sw-helping-sw channel). Use shared forums even if you need an answer from a specific person; you can mention their name in your post.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c02-0014">Batch Your Synchronous Requests</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Chat and email are great for simple questions, but complex discussions don’t work asynchronously. In-person conversations are “high bandwidth” and “low latency.” You can cover a lot quickly. This is costly, though. Interrupting your coworkers affects their productivity. Avoid this by setting up dedicated time with your tech lead or manager for nonurgent questions. Schedule a meeting, or use “office hours” if they exist. Write down questions and hold them until the meeting. You can do your research in the meantime. Your list will grow as other questions arise. This is good. Include the list in your meeting agenda. Don’t rely on your memory, and don’t come unprepared.</p>
			<p>Cancel the meeting if you have no questions. If you find yourself canceling repeatedly, ask whether the meeting is still useful—if not, unschedule it.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-501836c02-0003">Overcoming Growth Obstacles</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Knowing how to learn and ask questions isn’t enough. You must also avoid traps that slow growth. Two common impediments, impostor syndrome and the Dunning–Kruger effect, affect many engineers. You will grow faster if you understand what these phenomena are and how to overcome them.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c02-0015"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_22" title="22"/>Impostor Syndrome</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Most new engineers start off consciously incompetent. There’s a lot to learn, and everyone else seems far ahead. You might worry that you don’t belong or that landing your job was luck. It’s easy to be hard on yourself—we’ve experienced this ourselves. No matter how often we tell engineers they’re doing a great job, some don’t believe it, even when they’re getting promoted! It makes them uncomfortable. They say they’ve gotten lucky, they don’t deserve recognition, or the promotion criteria are too lax. This is <em>impostor syndrome</em>. It was first described in a 1978 study by Drs. Pauline Rose Clance and Suzanne Ament Imes, “The Impostor Phenomenon in High Achieving Women: Dynamics and Therapeutic Intervention.”</p>
			<blockquote class="review trade">
				<p class="Blockquote">Despite outstanding academic and professional accomplishments, women who experience the impostor phenomenon persist in believing that they are really not bright and have fooled anyone who thinks otherwise. Numerous achievements, which one might expect to provide ample objective evidence of superior intellectual functioning, do not appear to affect the impostor belief.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>If this resonates with you, know that self-doubt is common. With effort, these feelings will pass. You can move things along with several strategies: awareness, reframing, and talking to colleagues.</p>
			<p>Impostor syndrome is self-reinforcing. Every error is seen as proof of incompetence, while every success is evidence of a good “faker.” Once an individual enters this cycle, it is difficult to get out of. Awareness helps: if you watch for this pattern, you can consciously break it. When you accomplish something, it’s because you actually did it—you aren’t just getting lucky.</p>
			<p>
				Don’t dismiss compliments and accomplishments. Write them down, even the small stuff. Your peers are capable, and if they say something positive, they have good reason to. Practice reframing negative <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_23" title="23"/>thoughts: “I had to bug Daria to help with a race condition” becomes “I reached out to Daria, and now I know how to resolve race conditions!” Plan what you want to accomplish and notice when you achieve a goal. This will build confidence.</p>
			<p>Getting feedback also helps. Ask someone you respect to tell you how you’re doing. This can be your manager, a mentor, or just an engineer you look up to. The important thing is that you trust them and feel safe talking to them about self-doubt.</p>
			<p>Therapy might also help. Use it to gain comfort with your strengths and work through short-term challenges. Impostor syndrome, and the anxiety and depression that can accompany it, is a complex topic. If you are struggling, consider talking to a few therapists to find one whose approach works for you.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c02-0016">The Dunning–Kruger Effect</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Opposite to impostor syndrome is the <em>Dunning–Kruger effect</em>, a cognitive bias where people believe that they’re more capable than they actually are. Unconsciously incompetent engineers don’t know what they don’t know, so they can’t accurately evaluate their performance (or anyone else’s). They are too confident; they storm around critiquing the company’s technical stack, complaining about code quality, and belittling design. They are certain that their ideas are right. Their default mode is to push back on or disregard feedback. Rejecting all suggestions serves as a giant red light: complete confidence is the sign of a blind spot.</p>
			<p>Fortunately, the Dunning–Kruger effect is less common among new engineers. There are many ways to fight it. Start by consciously developing curiosity. Be open to being wrong. Find a respected engineer, ask how you’re doing, and truly listen. Talk over design decisions, especially those you don’t agree with. Ask why the decisions were made. Cultivate a mindset of trade-offs, not of right and wrong.</p>

			<p class="BodyFirst">Dave Hoover and Adewale Oshineye’s <em>Apprenticeship Patterns: Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman</em> (O’Reilly Media, 2009) is a great collection of “patterns” one can use to get started in a new environment, seek guidance, learn skills deeply, and overcome common hurdles.</p>

				For more on asking questions, we recommend <em>All You Have to Do Is Ask: How to Master the Most Important Skill for Success</em> by Wayne Baker (Currency, 2020). This book is divided into two parts. The first section discusses the value of asking questions and why it’s hard. The second half of the book is a toolkit for asking questions effectively.</p>

				For more on pair programming, the classic text is <em>Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change</em> by Kent Beck and Cynthia Andres (Addison-Wesley, 2004). The book covers much more than just pair programming. If you are interested in a shorter read, the article “On <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_25" title="25"/>Pair Programming” by Birgitta Böckeler and Nina Siessegger at <a class="LinkURL" href="https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html">https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/on-pair-programming.html</a> is an excellent practical guide.</p>

				If you find that the impostor syndrome or Dunning–Kruger sections resonate, check out <em>Presence: Bringing Your Boldest Self to Your Biggest Challenges</em> by Amy Cuddy (Little, Brown &amp; Company, 2016). Many common causes of both work anxiety and overconfidence are covered in the book.</p>

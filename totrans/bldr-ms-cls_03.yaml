    creating projects in Blender easy. This includes gathering and creating references,
    designing your characters, planning the composition of the final image, and setting
    up Blender to make the resources you have gathered available while you work. At
    the end of the chapter, we will be ready to start modeling our projects, with
    a more solid idea of what it is we want to create and how to go about getting
    there.

    This means that you don’t need to keep the whole of your idea in your head all
    the time, and you can plan ahead for the different parts of your project, saving
    you time and effort. Use your sketches each time you begin part of your project
    as a reminder of your goals. You can use reference images or concept art directly
    in Blender or GIMP to help with the modeling and texturing process, whether you
    use them as background images or as a starting point for projecting and baking

    Ruins project in this book, I began by searching Flickr and Google Images with
    phrases like “jungle ruin” and “Mayan temple” and then gathering images I liked.

    a sci-fi spaceship, it can help to examine real-world objects that share some
    aspects of your design in order to help better visualize your creation. For example,
    when creating a dragon, you might search for images of dinosaurs, lizards, large
    birds, bats, or even mammalian predators, like lions or wolves. Each animal might
    have some aspect that you can use in your dragon, like the pattern of scales on
    a lizard or the wing structure of a bird or bat. When creating a spaceship, you
    could examine existing crafts, like space shuttles, airplanes, industrial vehicles,
    or even automobiles. Adopting aspects of existing things will help bring realism
    and believability to your work.

    this distortion into your model, you are bound to get some strange results. If
    you can’t get a photograph taken with a long lens, at least try to determine what
    lens was used when the image was taken and keep this in mind when modeling.'

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When creating any artwork, whether animated or still, it is important to think
    about composition, and doing so before you start will make it a lot easier to
    fit together the final elements of your scene. This was particularly true for
    the Jungle Ruins project, where the goal was to create a final image from a single
    vantage point. Remember that you want the final results not only to look convincing
    and detailed but also to be pleasing to the eye when placed within the setting
    of your final renders.

- en: The Rule of Thirds
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The rule of thirds principle argues that the points of interest in an image
    should fall roughly in line with an imaginary grid drawn over the image. This
    imaginary grid splits the image into thirds along both its length and width. The
    goal is to carve the image into less symmetrical areas to produce something that
    is generally more pleasing to the eye, as opposed to an image split right down
    the middle by the various points of interest. [Figure 3-3](ch03.html#jungle_ruins_project_at_the_blocking-in
    "Figure 3-3. The Jungle Ruins project at the blocking-in stage, with a rule of
    thirds grid overlaid") shows how I split an image into a total of nine sections,
    using three rows and three columns.

    Jungle Ruins project at the blocking-in stage, with a rule of thirds grid overlaid'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For another example of the rule of thirds in action, think of a scene showing
    the sky and a horizon together with some buildings. Applying the rule of thirds,
    we would place the horizon at one horizontal division of the image (about one-third
    of the way up from the bottom or down from the top), with the sky occupying the
    area above the horizon. If the main points of interest are situated above the
    horizon, such as a tall building or a lit moon in the night sky, we might place
    the horizon above the lower third of the image to allow the building and moon
    to occupy more space. On the other hand, if the main points of the image are below
    the horizon, say some boats on a lake, placing the horizon at the upper third
    division would allow us to give the boats more space while creating a balanced
    composition.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The rule of thirds doesn’t always apply to images containing single characters,
    however. For example, if your image is a portrait or full-body shot of a character,
    it will likely make more sense to give the subject center stage. But even in these
    cases, you might apply the rule of thirds to other aspects of the image, such
    as the character’s eyeline or a heavy object carried in his arms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s worth pointing out that the rule of thirds isn’t the only theory driven
    by the beauty of asymmetry and imbalance. Other rules, like the golden mean, which
    places the grid lines according to the golden ratio (approximately 1.618:1), have
    similar effects and share the goal of not dividing an image into obvious symmetrical
    halves.

    is the outline of your subject, as shown in [Figure 3-4](ch03.html#silhouette_of_the_bat_creature
    "Figure 3-4. Silhouette of the Bat Creature"). If when looking at your image’s
    silhouette you can still tell what the image is, you have a strong design. If
    the silhouette looks like just a jumble of shapes, however, viewers may have a
    hard time processing the image, even in its final state. To get a better idea
    of your model’s silhouette, try adding a black material to it with no specularity
    (see [Chapter 12](ch12.html "Chapter 12. Materials")), and render it on its own
    to see it as a black shape on a plain background ([Figure 3-4](ch03.html#silhouette_of_the_bat_creature

    other objects also affects the appearance of your composition. For example, when
    placing the horizon on a rule of thirds line, as discussed in the previous section,
    we are likely to create a pleasing negative space in the form of the sky.

    your image is busy with too much going on, a viewer may be overwhelmed and not
    know what to pay attention to. To avoid potential confusion, an image should have
    some “rest” areas—parts that are simple and don’t demand attention so that other,
    more important parts are not overlooked. For example, if you model and texture
    a fantastic portrait, you might avoid putting a complex, cluttered background
    in the negative space behind the portrait because this background might distract
    the viewer. The negative space in this example is the rest area, but rest areas
    may simply be less complex and detailed parts of the main image itself.

    the viewer will naturally look to the intersections of the rule of thirds lines
    first. You can also use perspective, allowing converging lines in the image to
    direct the viewer through your composition’s various focal points. Or you might
    frame the points of interest with negative space. In images containing characters,
    you might have the characters look at the focal point so that the viewer follows
    their gaze, or you might even just have the characters point at it!

    Then in the Properties editor under the Object Data tab, you can set the empty’s
    display type to **Image** and select an image to display (see [Figure 3-12](ch03.html#same_image_used_as_an_image_empty_can_no
    "Figure 3-12. The same image used as an image empty can now be viewed from any
    angle. If your image has an Alpha (transparency) channel, it too will display
    as a transparent image in the Viewport.")). The empty will now display this image
    on a plane that you can move, scale, and rotate to place the image in your scene
    as you would any object, but this object won’t interfere with your renders because
    it will be visible only in the 3D Viewport.

- en: In this chapter, we have looked at the preparatory steps to think about when
    working on a project in Blender, including planning what you want to make, collecting
    reference and concept art, and generating ideas for your final composition. We
    then moved on to discuss ways to make this information available to you in Blender
    while you work. In the next chapter, we begin modeling our projects. By blocking
    out the key elements of our projects, we will develop a foundation on which to
    build more complex models.

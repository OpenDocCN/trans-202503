<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">I</span>n late 2009, a year after 1.0 shipped, Android institutionalized extra working hours by starting the tradition of <em>Bacon Sundays</em>. Previously, people would simply be at work all the time. But eventually, people started spending weekend time <em>not</em> working. But Android still had the same do-or-die dynamic as it did before (albeit with more people to handle the load). Release deadlines were critical; they <em>had</em> to hit those dates. So toward the end of a release, management encouraged people to come to the office on Sunday morning with the promise of a big breakfast buffet spread (along with plenty of work). Participation wasn’t required, and not everybody came in on those Sundays. But there was an understanding that there was a lot of work to do, and a team effort would help.</p>
<p>Hiroshi Lockheimer came up with the idea. “We were behind schedule for the Droid—we were probably behind our fourth schedule—and that was a Big Deal. There was a big launch, with a lot of marketing behind it, so we were like ‘Shit, what do we do? Gotta come in on weekends and make it happen.’</p>
<p>“I wanted to make it fun. I love bacon. In retrospect, not everyone likes bacon, so bacon probably was not the best choice. I don’t eat it that much anymore. Turns out it’s not good for your health.</p>
<p>“We had launches coming up. We had devices that needed to ship. These OEMs needed our software by a certain date or else they were going to miss the holiday season. All Hell was going to break loose, and Andy was going to get upset.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_298" title="298"/>“It was clear we needed more time. The only way I could think of to get more time was to work on weekends. So Sundays—not every Sunday—but in the summer it became kind of a . . . in retrospect, kind of a sad tradition.”</p>
<p>By 10:00 in the morning (it’s difficult to get most engineers in the office earlier than that, breakfast or no), there would be a full, catered spread with brunch goodies, including a large tray of bacon. People wandered into the cafeteria, ate their fill and caught up with co-workers, then headed to their desks to continue working on the product.</p>
<p>Mike Cleron, who managed the framework team at the time (and for many years afterward), was known for haiku that he would send out to the engineering team. He wrote some in celebration of Bacon Sundays:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p class="Blockquote"><em>sunday brings strange scene</em></p>
<p class="Blockquote"><em>androids battling killer bugs</em></p>
<p class="Blockquote"><em>life, or bad sci-fi?</em></p>
<p class="Blockquote"> </p>
<p class="Blockquote"><em>lost in sleepless fog </em></p>
<p class="Blockquote"><em>spirits willing though brains dim </em></p>
<p class="Blockquote"><em>bacon, give us strength</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Bacon Sundays went away by the time the team shipped KitKat, in the Fall of 2013. The team had grown, so there were simply more people available to help hit the deadlines. Also, the releases were not as frequent as they were in the early days, so there wasn’t as much constant schedule panic. Finally, management recognized that enough was enough, and people wanted their weekend lives back.</p>
<p>So Bacon Sundays stopped. The team doesn’t miss them.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c35-footnote-1" id="c35-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup></p>

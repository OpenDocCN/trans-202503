    use in the creation of your friendly little bots are basic hand tools. In fact,
    you’ll be using only a very limited number of power tools, but more on that in
    a bit.

- en: The primary power tool you’ll be using in this book is a power drill. It does
    not matter whether yours is battery powered or corded; however, I prefer to use
    a corded drill because it’s cheaper and won’t run out of power while I’m working.

- en: In addition to the drill, you’ll need some general-purpose *split point drill
    bits*. These are what the drill spins to cut holes in objects. The drill will
    always make a hole that’s the same width as the drill bit you are using, so try
    to find a drill bit set that includes a variety of sizes. Buying a set is an easy
    and economical way to make sure you are able to drill a wide variety of holes.
    Sets that you find at the hardware store typically range in size from 1/16 inch
    up to 1/2 inch in diameter.

    of a center point and outside cutting edges called *spurs*. The *center point*
    makes a small hole in the middle of what you are drilling. This keeps the spade
    in place as the spurs cut a much larger outer hole. This type of drill bit is
    used to cut holes wider than 1/2 inch. The spade bit size you’ll use most is 3/4
    inch.

    you insert the drill bit. This is called the *chuck*, and it has jaws inside that
    open and close to grab onto the drill bit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To open the jaws of the chuck, twist it counterclockwise until the jaws are
    slightly wider than the drill bit. Insert a drill bit into the chuck so there’s
    some space between the end of the chuck and the drill bit’s spiral cutting flutes.
    Twist the chuck clockwise until its jaws clamp down on the shank of the drill
    bit.

    other words, the drill bit should spin entirely on-center. If it appears to be
    mounted off-center, remove the drill bit and go through the process of inserting
    it again.

    direction. You usually change rotation direction (clockwise or counterclockwise)
    with a switch found near the drill’s trigger button, and how hard you press the
    trigger button determines the speed. The harder you press, the faster the drill
    bit spins.

    to use to attach things together, and they’re easy to undo if you make a mistake.
    They’re strong, they don’t easily break or snap, and they’re also cheap and readily
    available—all great attributes for building simple robots.

    pull it tight. You’ll hear the plastic make a “zip” noise as it’s pulled through.
    Notice how once it has been tightened, it cannot be loosened. This is both a benefit
    and a curse. If you mess up, the only way to undo the zip tie is with cutting
    pliers or scissors.

    easy to use and come in a variety of sizes. Nuts and bolts have two standards
    of measurement: imperial and metric. In the US, the standard is imperial, so everything
    is measured in inches and fractions of an inch. Metric is used in the rest of
    the world. This book is primarily written for a US audience, so I’ll use imperial
    measurements.'

    of the bolt, and the second is the thread spacing. For instance, a ¼-20 bolt is
    1/4 inch wide and has 20 threads per inch. A ½-13 bolt is 1/2 inch wide and has
    13 threads per inch.

    with glue or tape. It is always preferable to use mechanical fasteners over adhesives
    since they’re easier to undo. That said, on a few occasions in this book you’ll
    attach things with adhesives—primarily when you use painter’s tape to temporarily
    attach paper drill templates to objects. One project (the Skitter Bot) uses glue,
    which I’ll cover in Chapter 10.

- en: This book doesn’t require any fixed set of materials or a building kit. You
    can build these bots using stuff you find around the house, and you may not find
    the exact parts used here. I’ll describe the parts as best I can in the materials
    list for each bot, but you can improvise with what is available to you. For instance,
    if the book calls for using a plastic container as the robot body, you could potentially
    swap it out with a cardboard or wooden box. Also, you might replace a wheel made
    from a CD with a large, round bike reflector. The idea is that you observe the
    basic shapes and materials for the different components and simply replace them
    with what you have on hand. Aside from the electronics, rarely is a part so specific
    that it cannot be swapped out.

    bots isn’t an exact science.” However, this is only a half-truth. A great deal
    of robotics uses precise scientific principles, but this book explores the part
    of robotics that requires creativity, ingenuity, and experimentation. It’s intended
    to inspire you to play, improvise, and innovate. Think of the directions as guidelines,
    and feel free to change them to suit your purposes.

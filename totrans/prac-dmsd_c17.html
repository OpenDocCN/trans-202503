			<p class="ChapterIntro">Sanitation is a curious topic. It’s an essential part of our lives but also a bit taboo, politely glossed over in disaster fiction and in most discussions of emergency preparedness.</p>
			<p>Naturally, matters such as waste disposal can be left to the imagination when an author weaves a tale of a lone survivor traversing the pristine wilderness. But during a water outage in an urban high-rise, you might end up with a pressing problem in the blink of an eye. Many other household tasks, such as doing laundry or bathing, also get complicated when the taps are dry—and especially for families with young children, can’t be postponed forever.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c17-0001">Waste Disposal</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Although ubiquitous indoor plumbing is a fairly recent development, sustainable methods of sanitary waste disposal have been with us for thousands of years. The solutions varied in complexity and elegance, ranging from <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_146" title="146"/>regularly emptied communal cesspits to the sophisticated sewer systems of the ancient Greeks—but whatever the method, almost every permanent human settlement went to considerable lengths to keep the problem in check. Even in medieval Europe, the situation wasn’t nearly as dire as commonly portrayed in fiction. Some cities occasionally experienced issues, but the popular tropes of grime-covered peasants and human excrement piling up in the streets are more a matter of artistic license than of demonstrable fact.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c17-endnote-1" id="c17-noteref-1">1</a></sup></p>
			<p>Today, municipal sewers and flush toilets do away with all the ickiness of storing or treating waste in the vicinity of our homes. On the flip side, our reliance on such technologies means that if the water stops flowing, we find ourselves not in the shoes of mid-19th century Londoners, but in a far more perilous spot. Of course, small-scale disasters pose little concern. If only a block or two are affected by a water outage, it’s easy to swing by a nearby gas station or rent a porta-potty for a couple of days. But during large-scale crises, the options aren’t clear-cut—and while rural families with septic tanks may have little to worry about, many suburbanites and city dwellers may be forced to take decidedly unsanitary steps.</p>
			<p>
				In principle, a water outage needn’t stop you from using your toilet. You can manually refill a freestanding unit by removing the top cover of the tank, and even in systems with the tank built into the wall, flushing can be achieved with less precision but good results by rapidly dumping two to three gallons of water into the bowl. That said, the sheer amount of water needed to keep a toilet working is a significant issue for most families, except—as noted in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 15">Chapter 15</span>—for those with backyard pools or ponds. Collecting and using rainwater can be an option, but only in some climates and in certain months of the year. Another possible solution is to recycle household gray water. Ignoring the slight yuck factor, the toilet tank can be refilled with whatever’s left after cooking, dishwashing, or doing the laundry.</p>
			<p>
				Still, even with these creative water-use methods, most households simply won’t have enough water to regularly operate their toilets in the long haul. What’s more, your own efforts won’t necessarily forestall the possibility of issues arising downstream. Although municipal sewers rely chiefly on gravity, pumps—known as <em>lift stations</em>—must be added every now and then to help navigate terrain. Many lift stations have backup power, but typically just for a couple of hours. Once the fuel runs out, nearby customers may experience difficulties flushing, or even see sewage flowing back into their homes—especially during the periods of heavy rain.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c17-footnote-1" id="c17-footnoteref-1">*</a></sup></p>
			<p>
				When flushing the toilet is impractical or inadvisable, the simplest solution is bagging solid waste. The task can be accomplished by opening a trash bag, taping it to a toilet seat, and then closing the bag after use and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_147" title="147"/>discarding it in a curbside collection bin or other lidded container of sufficient size. In the winter, this method can be quite sustainable, but on hot summer days, it can quickly create a foul mess. In such a case, chemical treatment can help. Using a scoop of hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide), a common gardening supply, is a cost-effective solution that creates a highly alkaline environment inhospitable to microbes. Another route is to dehydrate the waste with bentonite-based kitty litter, thus preventing decay. If you choose one of these approaches, maintaining an ample supply of trash bags and treatment materials will be an important part of your plans.</p>
			<p>
				If the outage continues for days or weeks, a more sustainable alternative is to start digging out a <em>pit latrine</em>—a deep hole with some sort of a cover, where you can dump waste and let it naturally decompose. A depth of at least five to six feet is preferable, and the pit should be placed far from any household wells or ponds. To mitigate odors, you can then regularly cover the contents with a layer of soil. The main challenge is just digging the pit in the first place; rocky or clay soils are formidable foes. In high-density apartment complexes, coordinating with neighbors would be crucial too; it doesn’t matter what <em>you</em> do if everybody else is resorting to stinky and unsanitary measures.</p>
			<p>In addition to stockpiling trash bags and digging tools, toilet paper is an oft-overlooked necessity in many preparedness plans. Having a carton set aside, and a roll or two packed with evacuation supplies, is almost always a good plan. The same goes for feminine hygiene products, diapers, kitty litter, and so forth—depending on your family’s specific needs.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c17-0002">Containment of Flooding and Leaks</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Water is essential around the house, but it’s a disaster when it ends up somewhere it’s not supposed to go. Whether it’s a faulty appliance, a damaged fixture, a leaky roof, or backed-up sewage, five-figure losses can mount in a matter of minutes if you don’t have a way to stop or divert the leak. During severe storms, groundwater and surface water can become a problem too. Drainage issues are so common that millions of homes in the United States are fitted with sump pumps permanently hooked up in the basement to keep the structure dry, but such a pump is of no use when the power is out.</p>
			<p>For plumbing leaks, the first step is clear: shut off the water, and then possibly open low-lying taps to drain the system as quickly as possible. But if the source of water can’t be eliminated, containment is the backup plan. Perhaps the most expedient solution are long “socks” filled with naturally absorbent material or compact hydrogel that expands on contact with water; PIG Sock and Quick Dam are two well-known brands. The socks are usually around five feet long and can hold back around one inch of water. This is often enough to allow the spill to be pumped out, collected into a bucket, or directed toward a point where the mess can safely drain.</p>
			<p>
				When storm drains are overflowing and water is coming down the street, protecting the entire home from the elements is a more daunting task. Sandbags are a popular choice that can be stored easily and then filled <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_148" title="148"/>as needed, but they require a source of sand; as noted before, clay-based or rocky soils can make it difficult to fill the bags in time. A more robust alternative are plastic water diversion barriers that can be filled with water from a garden hose. One popular brand is HydraBarrier, with several models that can hold back anywhere from 4 to 12 inches of water without floating away. The barriers are available in lengths all the way to 100 feet.</p>
			<p>Owners of single-family homes may also find it useful to have a portable submersible pump that connects to a garden hose, useful for expediently removing water from basements, crawl spaces, or other locations of this sort. Two popular US brands are Little Giant and Superior Pump. Such a pump won’t hold off the surge from a violent storm or a burst water main, but it can prevent many lesser problems from spiraling out of control.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c17-0003">Dishwashing, Laundry, and Other Chores</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">A crisis may offer little leeway on matters of flooding or personal waste, but many other sanitation tasks can be put on hold for days or even weeks. Don’t let that lull you into inaction, however: thinking about less urgent household chores can still pay off. For example, you can greatly cut down on dirty dishes if you opt for ready-to-eat meals that can be enjoyed straight out of the bag or can. In the same vein, keeping a stock of disposable plates and cutlery, along with several rolls of paper towels to wipe down plates and kitchenware, can help conserve water and time whenever one or both are in short supply.</p>
			<p>When it comes to general cleaning, grime can be allowed to accumulate for a while, but it pays to remember Murphy’s law and expect an untimely accident or two; this is especially true if you have kids or pets. The prepper community is obsessed with recipes for oddball DIY cleaning agents—often involving vinegar, hydrogen peroxide, or baking soda—but it’s simpler to have an extra bottle of your favorite surface cleaner squirreled away, along with some clean rags. Even when preparing for long-term emergencies, DIY cleaners are seldom a necessity. It’s better to look into concentrated products marketed to restaurants, hotels, or other commercial establishments. For example, a small bottle of Diversey PERdiem, normally diluted to 1 part cleaner per 64 parts water, would last in a typical household for a year or two.</p>
			<p>
				On the topic of laundry, some argue that clean clothes wouldn’t be a priority, but that’s an overly simplistic view. A spectrum of emergencies lie between “business as usual” and “back to the Stone Age,” and in many circumstances, you may still want to feel fresh. In the short term, the simplest approach may be just to have clean underwear in your emergency stash, but when laundry can no longer be avoided, undergarments can be soaked for a couple of hours in the sink with a small amount of water and detergent and agitated vigorously every now and then. The clothing can be then wrung out, rinsed, and hung to dry; with a bit of practice, it’s possible to make do with two to three gallons of water per batch. Regular dish soap can work just as well as a laundry detergent, but if you plan on storing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_149" title="149"/>laundry products, the longest shelf life can be expected of powdered formulations sold in plastic tubs. Popular brands to look for include Arm &amp; Hammer and Charlie’s Soap.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c17-0004">Personal Hygiene</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Anytime laundry is important, so is keeping bodily odors in check. The time-tested approach to bathing without running water is to fill a small bowl and then use a wet rag plus a touch of soap to wipe down all the areas of concern. But this method isn’t without problems. For one, it produces dirty linens and can be uncomfortable in the winter if the water is ice-cold. The approach is also cumbersome on the road.</p>
			<p>A more expedient alternative is to use store-bought wet wipes, ideally sealed in Mylar to prevent the contents of the original pouch from drying out. No-rinse shampoos and body washes deserve a mention too. These products, commonly used in healthcare settings for bedridden patients, are designed to lift dirt without leaving any irritating or unsightly residues.</p>
			<p>Another sustainable approach to emergency hygiene is to control the bacteria that cause bodily odors in the first place. Although there are limits to what’s possible, good antiperspirant can save the day. Products containing aluminum complexes—such as aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly—are hard to beat, so even if you prefer more natural-sounding formulations, it might be a compromise worth making in the time of need. Of course, because antiperspirant dries out skin and can be irritating, it shouldn’t be used on your intimate parts; benzalkonium chloride (BZK) wipes, available from companies such as Dynarex, are a better choice on that front. Such medicated wet wipes contain a substance that is both a detergent and a potent but gentle antiseptic, and work wonders when alternatives are out of reach.</p>
			<p>Antiperspirant aside, a close look at your everyday bathroom routine may reveal other supplies worth including in an emergency kit. Most people would probably want to keep an extra tube of toothpaste, for example, and many may want to include safety razors and shaving cream.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c17-0005">Medication and Medical Supplies</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">In a disaster, well-being depends not only on staying fresh and fabulous, but also on the ability to deal with any incidental illness or injury that arises along the way. That said, medical care during emergencies shouldn’t be confused with emergency medicine. The problems to account for in a disaster plan are for the most part no different from the ailments we experience on normal days. Many survivalists imagine treating gunshot wounds or performing field amputations, but in most circumstances, good tweezers and cough medicine are worth more than a bone saw.</p>
			<p>
				It’s important to remember that seemingly prosaic health conditions can turn life-threatening when circumstances deteriorate; for example, preventable and treatable diarrheal diseases kill more than a million <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_150" title="150"/>people annually in some of the poorest countries of the world.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c17-endnote-2" id="c17-noteref-2">2</a></sup> On the flip side, many of the worries inspired by survival fiction, such as gruesome infections, are overblown. It’s unusual for gunshot injuries or knife wounds to get seriously infected; in one study of major hand lacerations, the overall infection rate hovered around 5 percent.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c17-endnote-3" id="c17-noteref-3">3</a></sup> The one type of routine injury that is prone to getting infected is animal bites, but on that front, prevention is worth more than a cure.</p>
			<p>For readers who are critically dependent on prescription medication to treat chronic health conditions, the first step of building an emergency healthcare plan is to ensure the uninterrupted supply of the necessary drugs. This should start with a frank conversation with your doctor—but because of the pop-cultural stigma of prepping, broaching the topic in a less inflammatory way may be useful. In rural places, it may be enough to discuss a previous incident of getting snowed in for a couple of weeks and express a desire to have a safety margin if the prescription can’t be refilled in time. In urban settings, upcoming travel may be a reasonable motivation.</p>
			<p>
				The conversations around scheduled drugs, such as most pain medication, will be more difficult. Doctors are subject to strict regulations and often skeptical of the stories their patients tell, so success is unlikely unless the doctor knows you well. Perishable medications, such as insulin or epinephrine, pose some challenges too. They aren’t difficult to obtain but may need to be replenished fairly regularly, possibly at a nontrivial cost. Maintaining a first-in, first-out stockpile, as discussed in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 16">Chapter 16</span>, may reduce waste. Refrigeration can help too but isn’t suitable for all meds.</p>
			<p>Prescriptions aside, quite a few common over-the-counter (OTC) medications are worth having at home and on the road, unless specific contraindications preclude their use. Common examples include meclizine (to treat vomiting, vertigo, and motion sickness), loperamide (for diarrhea), cetirizine (for allergies), ibuprofen (for fever and headaches), and dextromethorphan (for cough). Sufferers of serious hay fever may benefit from nasal glucocorticoids (such as triamcinolone acetonide or fluticasone propionate); those prone to asthma may also want to add Primatene, an OTC epinephrine inhaler available in the United States. Rehydration salts can help with recovery from electrolyte imbalance; caffeine pills can be of use when you need to stay alert longer than usual; and extra contraceptives may be valuable to couples who don’t want to conceive.</p>
			<p>When it comes to skin conditions, topical lidocaine cream (anesthetic), miconazole nitrate (antifungal), and hydrocortisone (anti-itch) come in handy sooner or later, and are probably worth including in almost every kit. For dealing with serious cuts and other injuries, plenty of options are available, but it’s important to be realistic. Without practice, for instance, few of us would be able to properly suture wounds, so skin staplers and elastic bandages (such as 3M Vetrap) tend to be much more practical. Clean water can be used to rinse dirty wounds; despite their popularity, the merits of antiseptic rinses and ointments aren’t clear-cut.</p>
			<p>
				For many respiratory diseases, it’s good to have a dependable thermometer and a clip-on pulse oximeter, along with spare batteries for both. Although these devices don’t really aid in treatment, they’re a good way to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_151" title="151"/>decide when it’s essential to seek urgent medical care, and in that capacity, they’re particularly useful with small children who can’t express themselves well.</p>
			<p>Oral antibiotics are controversial in the prepper community. It’s true that their frivolous use contributes to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of diseases—but this is an argument against casual self-medication, not against keeping an emergency stash of last resort. The need to match antibiotics to a specific ailment, or the health risks of taking the wrong one, are often overstated too. Popular choices, such as amoxicillin, have broad-spectrum activity and are unlikely to cause serious harm (except to those with specific and generally well-understood allergies). In some parts of the world, the substances are available over the counter, and can be stockpiled easily. In other places, preppers resort to stashing away leftovers or purchasing pills labeled for veterinary use.</p>
			<p>Another topic worth considering in an emergency plan is dental care. Although most dental issues develop slowly, some—such as a chipped tooth—can arise suddenly and cause debilitating pain. Topical anesthetics, including benzocaine ointments and eugenol, can be the first line of defense, while temporary cement may be used to protect the exposed area for a couple of days. Dental picks and floss for removing stuck pieces of food can be useful in any evacuation kit as well.</p>
			<p>Of course, in a now-familiar mantra, it should be said that the list of supplies outlined in this section isn’t exhaustive. Other OTC medications may be valuable to people prone to certain ailments, and various surgical and wound care implements—from hemostats to chest seals—may be of interest to readers hoping to build more comprehensive kits. That said, as with anything else, going overboard has diminishing returns—and there are very real risks of using such tools improperly and causing serious harm.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c17-0006">Medical Skills</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Medical knowledge is worth more than trauma gear, and a lot of this knowledge relies on muscle memory. Few people can properly perform the Heimlich maneuver or administer CPR simply because they read a pamphlet several years back. Signing up for basic first-aid training is therefore a vital part of any preparedness strategy.</p>
			<p>
				The Stop the Bleed program (<a class="LinkURL" href="https://www.stopthebleed.org/">https://www.stopthebleed.org/</a>) is of particular note. It covers injuries that happen to all age groups and in situations where the initial response—before the paramedics arrive—can make the difference between death and swift recovery. Knowing when and how to apply a makeshift tourniquet, or how to stop the bleeding from a torso wound (applying substantial pressure with your hands or even with an elbow or a knee should help), can save a life.</p>
			<p>
				In contrast, the more commonly taught CPR procedure is actually far less beneficial than perceived, perhaps because of its entirely unrealistic portrayal in film. When surveyed, people believe that CPR is successful in 75 percent of all cases; the true survival rate for the sufferers of cardiac <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_152" title="152"/>arrest given CPR is perhaps 10 percent—often with vastly reduced quality of life.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c17-endnote-4" id="c17-noteref-4">4</a></sup> To be sure, this isn’t an argument against learning or performing CPR; rather, it means that you shouldn’t simply settle for a knowledge of this procedure and nothing more.</p>
			<p>
				For folks who can’t be persuaded to take a course, a good family health handbook is valuable to have at hand; the <em>Mayo Clinic Family Health Book</em> by Scott C. Litin (Mayo Clinic, 2018) is a solid pick. As for dealing with medical emergencies with makeshift tools, <em>Wilderness Medicine: Beyond First Aid</em> by William W. Forgey (Falcon Guides, 2017) is a fantastic choice.</p>

				<p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c17-footnoteref-1" id="c17-footnote-1">*</a></sup> To evaluate the risk of sewer backflow, it might be useful to obtain system maps from your municipality to figure out the location of the nearest lift station and the overall architecture of the sewer system. At-risk homes can be fitted with backflow valves to reduce the likelihood of accidents. This can cost about $1,500, although some cities offer homeowner subsidies.</p>

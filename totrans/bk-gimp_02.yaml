- en: Karine Delvare contributed to this book project from the beginning. The concept,
    as well as the organization and early drafts of the chapters, were created by
    both authors. But after publishers were found (one for the French edition and
    one for the English edition) and the editing process began, Karine became pregnant
    and decided that motherhood was her first priority. Olivier offered her his full
    support and took over the majority of book-related responsibilities after that.
    In the end, Karine wrote [Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Drawing and Illustration")
    and [Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Designing a Website"), and Olivier wrote
    the rest. Karine gave birth to a healthy, happy girl named Lina, and one year
    later she gave birth to a second baby girl, Sophie.

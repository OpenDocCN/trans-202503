- en: Karine Delvare contributed to this book project from the beginning. The concept,
    as well as the organization and early drafts of the chapters, were created by
    both authors. But after publishers were found (one for the French edition and
    one for the English edition) and the editing process began, Karine became pregnant
    and decided that motherhood was her first priority. Olivier offered her his full
    support and took over the majority of book-related responsibilities after that.
    In the end, Karine wrote [Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Drawing and Illustration")
    and [Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Designing a Website"), and Olivier wrote
    the rest. Karine gave birth to a healthy, happy girl named Lina, and one year
    later she gave birth to a second baby girl, Sophie.

  zh: 卡琳·德尔瓦尔从一开始就参与了这本书的项目。书的概念、组织结构以及章节的初步草稿都是由两位作者共同创作的。但在找到出版商（分别负责法语版和英语版）并开始编辑过程后，卡琳怀孕了并决定将母亲的责任放在首位。奥利维耶全力支持她，并在那之后接管了大部分与书籍相关的工作。最终，卡琳编写了[第三章](ch03.html
    "第三章 绘画与插图")和[第八章](ch08.html "第八章 设计一个网站")，而奥利维耶则编写了其余章节。卡琳生下了一个健康、快乐的女孩，名叫莉娜，过了一年后她又生下了第二个女儿，索菲。

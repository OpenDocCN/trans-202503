- en: Containers are essential to modern application architecture. They simplify packaging,
    deploying, and scaling application components. They enable building reliable and
    resilient applications that handle failure gracefully. However, containers can
    also be confusing. They look like completely different systems, with separate
    hostnames, networking, and storage, but they do not have many of the features
    of a separate system, such as a separate console or system services. To understand
    how containers look like separate systems without really being separate, letâ€™s
    explore containers, container engines, and Linux kernel features.

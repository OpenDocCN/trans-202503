<p class="chapterintro">This appendix provides an overview of basic computing terms and concepts you’ll need to understand before creating programs and apps. It also walks you through setting up your computer so you can run the Kotlin code in projects throughout this book.</p>
<p class="tx">If you are new to programming, I recommend reviewing this appendix to be sure you have the necessary background knowledge and workspace setup.</p>

<h2 class="h"><span id="h1-61"/><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">Key Definitions</span></h2>
<p class="tni">In this section, I’ll introduce a few key terms that are fundamental to understanding what a computer program is and how it works. The code we write relies on a bigger ecosystem of software (other programs such as the operating system and the compiler) and hardware (the computer) to be able to run and generate the desired output.</p>
<p class="tx"><span aria-label="382" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_382" role="doc-pagebreak"/>An <i class="calibre9">operating system (OS)</i> is a software program that serves as an intermediary between computer hardware and user applications. Popular operating systems include Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android, each tailored to specific devices and computing environments. An OS manages and controls various hardware resources—such as memory, processors, input/output devices, and storage—which provide a standardized interface for software programs to interact with the underlying hardware. It enables multiple applications to run concurrently, ensuring efficient and secure utilization of system resources.</p>
<p class="tx">A <i class="calibre9">computer program</i>, often referred to as <i class="calibre9">software</i> or an <i class="calibre9">app</i>, is a set of instructions that directs a computer to perform specific tasks. Programmers write these instructions to solve problems, automate processes, or execute desired computations. Once written, the program is typically translated into <i class="calibre9">machine code</i> or an <i class="calibre9">intermediate code</i> by a compiler or interpreter to make it executable on a computer. Examples of computer programs include word processors, web browsers, games, and operating systems.</p>
<p class="tx">To write computer programs, we use a <i class="calibre9">programming language</i>, a set of rules and symbols that can be understood and executed by a computer system. Examples include Kotlin, Python, Java, C/C++, JavaScript, Rust, and Go. Programming languages differ in syntax (the rules for writing programs), semantics (the meaning and behavior of programs), and level of abstraction (how close the language is to the format that the hardware can follow). Each language has its advantages and limitations, making it more or less suitable for different tasks such as web development, system programming, data analysis, or artificial intelligence.</p>
<p class="tx">A <i class="calibre9">library</i> is a collection of prewritten code modules or functions that programmers can use to perform common tasks. A <i class="calibre9">standard library</i> is an integral part of a programming language, bundled with its core distribution to provide the standardized functionality expected to be available on any system. It includes essential modules for tasks like input/output, data manipulation, printing, and networking. Libraries can facilitate reusing code, save time, and allow developers to build on existing solutions.</p>
<p class="tx">A <i class="calibre9">text editor</i> is a software application designed for creating, modifying, and formatting plain text files. Unlike word processors, which often include advanced formatting and layout features, text editors are focused on the fundamental task of working with unformatted text. Text editors are commonly used by software developers for writing code, as they provide a lightweight and distraction-free environment. Popular text editors include Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on macOS, and Vim on Linux. Also available are editors that have been customized for multiple platforms, such as Notepadd++ and Sublime Text.</p>
<p class="tx">An <i class="calibre9">integrated development environment (IDE)</i> is a comprehensive software tool designed to streamline and enhance the process of software development. It typically provides a unified environment that integrates various essential tools and features, including a text editor, a debugger, a compiler, and build automation tools. Modern IDEs also include features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and project management. Popular IDEs include Visual Studio Code, Eclipse, and IntelliJ IDEA, each catering to <span aria-label="383" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_383" role="doc-pagebreak"/>specific programming languages and development environments. We’ll use IntelliJ IDEA for completing all coding tasks in this book because it offers built-in support for Kotlin.</p>
<p class="tx">A <i class="calibre9">compiler</i> is a software tool that translates source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code or an intermediate code that can be executed directly by a computer or in various environments, such as the Java Virtual Machine (which we’ll discuss shortly). The compilation process involves several stages, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.</p>
<p class="tx"><i class="calibre9">Debugging</i> is the process of finding and fixing errors (bugs) in a computer program. It involves analyzing the code and using debugging tools and techniques to find the cause of unexpected or incorrect results. Debugging is a systematic and iterative task that requires technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and a good grasp of the software’s logic.</p>
<p class="tx">The <i class="calibre9">Java Development Kit (JDK)</i> is a software development kit used by Java and Kotlin developers for building, testing, and deploying applications. The JDK includes a set of tools and utilities that facilitate programming, including a compiler, a debugger, and other development tools. It also includes the <i class="calibre9">Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</i>, which is necessary for running Java/Kotlin applications. The JRE lacks a compiler and thus is used only to run precompiled Java or Kotlin programs. To create new programs, you’ll need a JDK.</p>
<p class="tx">The <i class="calibre9">Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</i> is a crucial component of the JRE and the JDK, serving as an abstraction layer between Java/Kotlin applications and the underlying hardware and operating system. It enables the execution of Java <i class="calibre9">bytecode</i>, the compiled form of Java or Kotlin source code. The JVM provides platform independence, allowing Java/Kotlin programs to run on any device with a compatible JVM. It manages memory and security features, as well as provides an execution environment for compatible applications by interpreting bytecode or using just-in-time compilation for optimized performance.</p>
<p class="tx">An <i class="calibre9">executable file</i> is a stand-alone file that can run on a computer and perform certain tasks. An executable file contains the machine code that the computer’s hardware can understand and execute, as well as information about how the code and data are organized in memory. Unlike a text file, an executable file is not human readable, because it is compiled from other files, such as source code files written in languages like Fortran, C, or C++. Examples of executable files are EXE files on Windows and APP files on macOS.</p>

<h2 class="h"><span id="h1-62"/><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">Workflow for Creating an App</span></h2>
<p class="tni">Creating a Kotlin app typically involves the following steps:</p>
<p class="listnumber">  1.  <b class="calibre6">Set up the project.</b> Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA to create a new Kotlin project. Choose the target platform (such as the JVM) and build system (such as Maven or Gradle). A build system automates compiling, <span aria-label="384" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_384" role="doc-pagebreak"/>testing, and packaging code into an executable form. Most of the time, the IDE’s default choices work well.</p>
<p class="listnumber1">  2.  <b class="calibre6">Code in Kotlin.</b> Use Kotlin to write the app logic. The IDE will typically autosave the code file in a designated folder before running the code or exiting.</p>
<p class="listnumber1">  3.  <b class="calibre6">Build and compile.</b> Compile the Kotlin code into bytecode. You can choose to build and run at the same time or to just build the project to check for any build-time errors.</p>
<p class="listnumber1">  4.  <b class="calibre6">Test.</b> Check the app’s quality and reliability with unit and integration testing. Unit testing ensures that each unit (for example, a function, a method, or a class) works as expected and promotes modular and clear code. Integration testing verifies the interactions and interfaces between components or systems in a larger app.</p>
<p class="listnumber1">  5.  <b class="calibre6">Debug.</b> Use the IDE’s debugging tools to identify and fix any issues in the code. Set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through the code to understand how it works. You can insert print statements in various code segments to ensure that the program logic is working as expected.</p>
<p class="listnumber2">  6.  <b class="calibre6">Deploy.</b> Package the compiled code and any resources into a deployable format. For this, you can create a Java Archive file from your app and its dependencies. A <span class="copyright_italic">Java Archive (JAR)</span> file is a collection of files that can be run as a Java application on a JVM.</p>

<p class="tni">Before you can start working through the chapters in this book and building your own Kotlin applications, you’ll need to complete these three steps.</p>
<section epub:type="division">
<h3 class="h1"><span id="h2-151"/><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_condensed_oblique_">Step 1: Download and Install IntelliJ IDEA</span></h3>
<p class="tni">Go to the IntelliJ IDEA download page (since the link to this page can change, find the current site with a quick internet search). Select the <b class="calibre6">Community Edition</b>, which is free to use for noncommercial purposes.</p>
<p class="tx">Download the <i class="calibre9">.exe</i> file for Windows, the <i class="calibre9">.dmg</i> file for macOS, or the <i class="calibre9">.tar.gz</i> file for Linux. The file will be downloaded to your default download folder. Windows and Mac users can double-click the downloaded file to start the installation; the installation wizard will guide you through the process. Installing IntelliJ IDEA on a Linux device requires additional steps, depending on the type of Linux powering your device. You can look up installation instructions for your specific system online.</p>

<span aria-label="385" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_385" role="doc-pagebreak"/>
<h3 class="h1"><span id="h2-152"/><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_condensed_oblique_">Step 2: Download and Set Up the JDK</span></h3>
<p class="tni">Next, you’ll need to install a JDK. I recommend using a version of the Azul Zulu JDK that comes bundled with the JavaFX graphics library, which will let you work on this book’s visualization projects without any further installation steps. I’ll guide you through this process and show you an example of how to do it on Windows devices. The steps for Mac devices should be very similar, but you can always look online for more detailed instructions if you need to.</p>
<p class="tx">Find the Download Azul JDKs page via a quick internet search. Choose the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version for Windows. Choose the type of device (CPU)—the most common type at the time of writing is x86-64-bit— and choose <b class="calibre6">JDK FX</b> as the Java package type.</p>
<p class="note"><span class="sans_dogma_ot_bold_b_15-n">WARNING</span></p>
<p class="note-txt"><i class="calibre9">Be sure to choose JDK FX and and not just JDK as the package type or the installation won’t include JavaFX.</i></p>
<p class="tx">Select <b class="calibre6">.</b><b class="calibre6"><i class="calibre9">msi</i></b> as the file type for downloading. Once you select the file type, the download process should start automatically, and the file should be saved in your default download folder.</p>
<p class="tx">Finally, double-click the downloaded file to start the installation. The installation wizard will take you through the process. You don’t have to make any changes to the default settings.</p>
<p class="tx">Another JDK package that comes bundled with JavaFX is BellSoft Liberica Full JDK. You can install it the same way. Alternatively, you can separately install the core Java SDK and OpenFX, an open source version of JavaFX. Refer to the respective websites for detailed instructions on the installation process and how to configure your IDE to use these installations.</p>

<h3 class="h1"><span id="h2-153"/><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_condensed_oblique_">Step 3: Create a New Project</span></h3>
<p class="tni">You’re now ready to create your very first “Hello, world!” app in Kotlin. For this, you’ll need to set up a new project. This section shows you how to proceed on a Windows device. The steps for other systems are very similar.</p>
<p class="tx">Launch IntelliJ IDEA by clicking the desktop icon or from the Start menu (you can use the search box to locate the program). In the left panel, Projects should be selected by default (if not, select this). Next, click the <b class="calibre6">New Project</b> button in the top right of the window. Your screen should now look similar to <a href="#figA-1" class="calibre2">Figure A-1</a>.</p>
<span aria-label="386" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_386" role="doc-pagebreak"/>
<figure class="img"><img alt="" class="img1" height="1149" id="figA-1" src="../images/FigureA-1.jpg" width="1283"/>
<figcaption><p class="cap"><span class="sans_futura_std_book_oblique_">Figure A-1: Setting up a new Kotlin project</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="tx">Enter <b class="calibre6">HelloWorld</b> as the project name (no spaces), and then select <b class="calibre6">Kotlin</b> as the Language and <b class="calibre6">Maven</b> or <b class="calibre6">Gradle</b> as the Build system.</p>
<p class="tx">You must also select the JDK required for compiling and running your code. If the installed Azul Zulu JDK is not preselected, open the drop-down menu by clicking the downward-pointing triangle, navigate to the folder where the JDK is installed, and select that folder. The location of the JDK might look like this: <i class="calibre9">C:\Program Files\Zulu\zulu-xx</i> (the last two digits represent the version number).</p>
<p class="tx">Click <b class="calibre6">Create</b> to make the IDE configure a new Kotlin project for you. This should bring you to the next screen, which shows the newly created project “HelloWorld” in the left panel.</p>
<p class="tx">Expand the Project tree by repeatedly clicking <b class="calibre6">&gt;</b> next to the project and its branch names until you see an empty folder named <i class="calibre9">kotlin</i>. Right-click <b class="calibre6"><i class="calibre9">kotlin</i></b> and select <b class="calibre6">New</b><span class="listnumber_menuarrow"></span><b class="calibre6">Kotlin class/File</b><span class="listnumber_menuarrow"></span><b class="calibre6">File</b>. Your screen should look similar to <a href="#figA-2" class="calibre2">Figure A-2</a>.</p>
<span aria-label="387" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_387" role="doc-pagebreak"/>

<figcaption><p class="cap"><span class="sans_futura_std_book_oblique_">Figure A-2: Creating a Kotlin file</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="tx">Enter <b class="calibre6">HelloWorld</b> in the filename box and press <small class="calibre12">ENTER</small> (the IDE should add <i class="calibre9">.kt</i> as an extension to the filename). You should be taken to the IDE code editor window, as shown in <a href="#figA-3" class="calibre2">Figure A-3</a>.</p>
<figure class="img"><img alt="" class="img1" height="1010" id="figA-3" src="../images/FigureA-3.jpg" width="1386"/>

</figure>
<p class="tx"><span aria-label="388" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_388" role="doc-pagebreak"/>You’re only a few steps away from writing and running your first Kotlin code. Enter the following lines of code in the code editor:</p>
<pre class="calibre10"><code class="calibre11">fun main() {
    // Print "Hello, world!" in the console.
    println("Hello, world!")
}</code></pre>
<p class="tx">This code creates the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">main()</span> function, the entry point for any Kotlin program. We use the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">fun</span> keyword to declare a function and define the function’s body within a pair of curly brackets.</p>
<p class="tx">Inside the function, we use <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">//</span> to write a <i class="calibre9">comment</i>, a block of text that is ignored by the compiler but tells the human user what a particular line or block of code will do. Finally, we use the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">println()</span> method, which is part of the standard Kotlin library, to print a message in the <i class="calibre9">console</i> (a text-based output window).</p>
<p class="tx">You can run this code by pressing <small class="calibre12">SHIFT</small>-F10 or by clicking the right-pointing green triangle next to Current File in the top panel. You can also use the Run menu to run this program. Why not try out all these options? Once you’ve run the program, the screen should look something like that shown in <a href="#figA-4" class="calibre2">Figure A-4</a>.</p>
<figure class="img"><img alt="" class="img1" height="1002" id="figA-4" src="../images/FigureA-4.jpg" width="1374"/>
<figcaption><p class="cap"><span class="sans_futura_std_book_oblique_">Figure A-4: Printing “Hello, world!” in Kotlin</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="tx">Notice the console along the bottom of the window. It displays the single line of output produced by this program: <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">Hello, world!</span></p>
<p class="tx">Congratulations on successfully composing and running your first Kotlin application! You’re now ready to start exploring the world of Kotlin.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="app07_1"><strong>G.1 TMS320M10, C15, C25, C5x</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Caps0ff (2020a) describes the photography and reverse engineering of TMS320M10 chips in Eighties arcade games from Taoplan, such as Flying Shark and Kyukyoku Tiger. The same technique works on early successors of the M10, such as the TMS320C25.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Caps0ff also mentions prior work into the TMS320C15, which used a contact ROM instead of a diffusion ROM. Bits in that chip used a different ordering scheme, and those in the popular BSMT2000 audio chip, a preprogrammed variant of the C15, have also been extracted by photography.<sup><a id="app7fn_1" href="footnotes.xhtml#app7fn1">1</a></sup></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A TMS320’s ROM ID is usually found near the model number, such as D70015 in their example. “Eh,” you might ask, “why do I care about their model number so many years after manufacturing, when all records have surely been lost?” Well, Caps0ff shares a lovely trick for this: in a mask-programmed ROM that has a unique mask for each customer, such as high-volume TMS320 chips, the ROM serial number is on the same mask as the ROM bits. So if you delayer to clarify the serial number, you will <em>also</em> be clarifying the ROM bits. They are on the same layer at exactly the same depth.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the M10, this was just the trick. Removing a few layers to clarify the serial number made the bits pop right out, when they had been barely visible from the surface.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_389"/>Caps0ff (2020b) describes the process of reverse engineering the TMS320C50 and TMS320C53 ROMs. The C53 from an arcade cabinet was their real target. By first dumping the ROM image from a C50 development kit with a debugger, then comparing that file to photographs of the ROM bits, they were able to know the ordering of the ROM bits in the C53, leaving only the bank ordering to guess. (The C53 has four banks, while the C50 has just one.) This ROM format is now one of many supported in Zorrom.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Some of the TMS320 chips can also be dumped by abusing their microprocessor mode to execute external memory. Details for this trick can be found in <a href="app06.xhtml#app06_2">Chapter F.2</a>.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="app07_2"><strong>G.2 CH340 Unknown Architecture</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Cornateanu (2021) is a general tutorial on decapsulation and delayering chips for photography and ROM recovery, and the CH340 USB/Serial controller is its example target. The top metal layer hides the bits, keeping them invisible from the surface.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Cornateanu describes delayering the chip with HF, which removed the top metal layer to expose the bits. From the look of his photos it’s a diffusion ROM, but the dice are quite small and I’ve had considerable trouble reproducing his work in my own lab.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Bit extraction was performed with Rompar, but because the CPU architecture was (and remains) unknown, the bits were decoded to bytes with Bitviewer, rather than Zorrom. Bit order was determined by looking at the address line decoder circuitry, then confirmed by recognizing USB descriptor tables and strings.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_390"/>After extracting the ROM, he knew the memory contents but still not the CPU architecture, which is a weird one built around 14-bit words. Writing an IDA Pro plugin for this architecture remains a work in progress.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="app07_3"><strong>G.3 Intel 8271 New ISA</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Evans (2020) describes a photographic dump of the Intel 8271 floppy controller’s mask ROM, which contains 864 bytes. This chip is also sold as the NEC D765.</p>&#13;
<p class="indenta">The order was successfully guessed as left-to-right then top-to-bottom, MSBit-first, with bytes built from one bit per 8-bit group. Bits were inverted. That gave the first few bytes as <span class="literal">fc 06 02 f7</span>. This happened to be correct, but the harder part was in figuring out the instruction set.</p>&#13;
<p class="indenta">Reverse engineering an instruction set requires some hints as to a starting position. Ken Shirriff’s encyclopedic knowledge came to the rescue. He found that Louie, Wipfli, and Ebright (1977) is a conference presentation on the chip’s design, including instruction counts and a die photograph. Ken also found that Louie had filed a patent, US4152761A, that describes the chip’s design.</p>&#13;
<p class="indenta">Armed with these sources and a ton of study of the instruction PLA bits, Evans reverse engineered much of the instruction set and then enough of the ROM to come up with a way to write raw floppy disk tracks. This made it possible to clone BBC Micro floppy disks, only a few decades too late for it to be profitable in piracy.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="app07_4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_392"/><strong>G.4 Nintendo 64 CIC</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Much like the CIC chip of the Nintendo NES described in <a href="ch25.xhtml#ch25">Chapter 25</a>, the Nintendo 64 uses a 4-bit Sharp microcontroller in the SM5 family to enforce licensing, so third parties cannot make their own games. Unlike the original NES, the N64’s CIC successfully prevented the appearance of unlicensed cartridges for the entirety of this console’s commercial lifetime.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">That is not, however, to say that the scheme lasted forever. Eighteen years after launch, the N64’s CIC chip was successfully broken independently by two teams and with two methods.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Kammerstetter et al. (2014) describes a technique for reverse engineering the test mode of the CIC chip, allowing a sort of debugger to be attached, which can then read the program more or less directly out of ROM.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As a parallel effort, Ryan, H, and McMaster (2015) describes a dump of the mask ROM by Dash etching, in which junctions are stained to indicate their doping with a mixture of HNO<sub>3</sub>, HF, and HAc acids under a strong light for a few seconds. Because Dash etching has a frustratingly low yield, they purchased a large number of cheap sports cartridges and decapsulated the CIC chips from these cartridges in bulk.</p>&#13;

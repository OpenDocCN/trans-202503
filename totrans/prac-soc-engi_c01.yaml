    the penetration testing ranges from 30/70 to 70/30\.

    sending fraudulent emails to influence or coerce a target into providing information,
    opening files, or clicking links. I cover the variety of techniques you might
    use to do this later in this book.

    Instead, they’re typically sent to lists of email addresses purchased by scammers
    and criminals. This means you’d probably send the email to a massive swath of
    people without collecting OSINT about them. For example, with little to no context
    about the target, you might put a generic email together that tries to get the
    user to either log in to a fraudulent website or download a file. When targets
    open the file, a remote shell might open on their computer, or the target might
    install malware. Once the attackers have the shell or malware installed, they
    can interactively communicate with the system and perform post-exploitation attacks
    and privilege escalation to continue compromising the system and network.

    and 5.8 percent of that traffic is malicious. That is 1 in 224 of all URLs!

    skills. While phishing affords you the time to think about what you’d like to
    say before you send your email, vishing entails having your story put together
    from the beginning and rapidly recalling abstract details of it. You might also
    have trouble getting people to answer the phone; misunderstand the layout of the

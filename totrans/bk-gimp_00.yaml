    successful applications in the world of free software. The name *GNU* is a recursive
    acronym: *GNU’s Not Unix*, coined in 1983 by the celebrated Richard M. Stallman
    as a name for his pet project—a free software, Unix-like operating system.'

- en: '*Free software* is a term used to describe software that can be used, studied,
    modified, and redistributed by anyone with only one, very reasonable restriction:
    that other users enjoy the same freedom to use the software and to examine and
    modify the software’s code. Free software is generally available without charge,
    but sometimes there is a fee.'

- en: The word *free* must be understood as in “free speech” rather than “free beer.”
    The term *software libre* is gaining some popularity, as it negates this ambiguity.
    The French word *libre* means *free* in the sense of liberty, whereas the word
    *gratuit* means free of charge.

- en: GIMP is freely distributed to (and by) anybody, and anybody can look at its
    contents and its source code and can add features or fix problems. The only restriction
    is that, if you make any change to GIMP and want to redistribute it to other people,
    you must do it in a way that grants the recipients exactly the same freedom that
    you enjoyed.

- en: GIMP began in 1995 as the school project of two university students; now GIMP
    is a full-fledged application, available on all distributions of GNU/Linux and
    on recent versions of Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. Installing GIMP is fairly
    easy, and if you haven’t already done so, take a minute and install GIMP now (see
    [Appendix E](ape.html "Appendix E. Installing GIMP") for installation instructions).

- en: 'Compared to the dominant commercial image-manipulation application, which is
    developed by an army of well-paid programmers, GIMP is currently developed by
    a very small team of unpaid, but enthusiastic, volunteer programmers. Keep this
    in mind if (read: when) you run into glitches in the program or when a feature
    you’d like to have isn’t available. Remember the GIMP credo: “If you want it so
    badly, make it, and share it with the rest of us!” Welcome to the world of free
    software!'

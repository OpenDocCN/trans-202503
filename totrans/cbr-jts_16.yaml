    recommends that enemies, especially suspected ninjas, be captured alive rather
    than immediately killed. Searching and interrogating a captured ninja allows shinobi
    to discover what the attacker has done or is planning to do, determine who the
    intruder’s employer is, and learn valuable secrets and tradecraft, all of which
    could greatly help guards defend against ninja attacks and help lords to understand
    strategic threats. In addition, the captured enemy might turn out to be a comrade
    in disguise, a fact that would not be clear until deep interrogation.^([1](b01.xhtml#endnote-104))
    The *Ninpiden* calls for the suspected ninja to be bound hand and foot and placed
    on a leash. The *Ninpiden* also recommends using tools, such as a spiked gag,
    to prevent the captive from talking, as a skillful ninja could alert allies, persuade
    their captor to release them, or even bite off their own tongue to commit suicide.^([2](b01.xhtml#endnote-105))

    One of *Bansenshūkai*’s more direct techniques involves loading a musket with
    a chili powder–infused cotton ball—a sort of ancient tear gas or pepper spray.
    When fired at close range, this projectile would create debilitating irritation
    in the target’s eyes and nose, rendering them more susceptible to capture. The
    scrolls also describe more oblique tactics, such as *fushi-kamari* ambushes and
    traps. For example, the tiger fall trap (*mogari* or *koraku*) described in *Bansenshūkai*
    *Gunyo-hiki* was originally designed to capture tigers (as the name suggests)
    but was later modified to capture ninjas. In it, barriers funnel an intruder through
    a maze of hidden traps. While allies would know a trusted path, a ninja infiltrating
    alone at night would not, making it likely they would fall into the trap. Other
    trap methods used *tsuiritei*, or “fake suspended wall sections,” which are veneers
    that look like real walls but are built with wedges and false posts. When a ninja
    would attempt to scale these fake walls, the walls would collapse, surprising
    and likely injuring the ninja and thus permitting their easy capture.^([3](b01.xhtml#endnote-106))

    ways to detect and avoid *fushi-kamari* ambushes. Shinobi were advised to scout
    forests, fields, valleys, trenches, and other settings for unnatural behavior
    from birds, other animals, and even the grass, all of which could indicate a trap.
    Dummies and unusual smells also tip the hand of a potential ambush.^([4](b01.xhtml#endnote-107))
    In enemy territory, shinobi could deploy a number of evasive tactics, including:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Quail hiding (*****uzura-gakure*****)** A shinobi would curl into a ball
    on the ground and concentrate on being blind, unaware, and unresponsive so the
    enemy would be unlikely to find them. Even when prodded by a guard with a spear
    or sword, they would not react.'

    would decide to be “caught” by a faster pursuer. When the gap between them narrowed,
    the shinobi would drop to the ground without warning and aim their sword at the
    pursuer’s waist, impaling the pursuer before they could react.'

- en: '**Retreat by 100 firecrackers (**hyakurai-ju**)** A shinobi would place firecrackers

    to light them. The sound would distract the enemy pursuers.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Fox hiding (**kitsune-gakure**)** A shinobi would escape by moving vertically.
    Instead of trying to flee enemy territory by moving from point A to point B, the
    shinobi would climb a tall tree or hide in a moat, changing the dimensions of
    the chase. This tactic often stumped the enemy, who was unlikely to think to look
    up or down for the target.^([5](b01.xhtml#endnote-108))'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other methods of escape included imitation—mimicking a dog or other animal to
    deceive pursuers—and false conversation—language that would mislead the enemy,
    allowing the shinobi to flee.^([6](b01.xhtml#endnote-109)) For example, a shinobi
    who knew they were being followed might pretend not to hear the pursuers and whisper
    to an imaginary ally so the alert guards would overhear them. If the shinobi said,
    “Let’s quietly move to the lord’s bedroom so we may kill him in his sleep,” the
    guards would likely send forces to the lord’s bedroom, allowing the shinobi to
    escape in another direction.

    Forensic images are typically made after a security incident (such as a malware
    infection) or a use violation (such as the download of child pornography onto
    a device), with imaging done in a way that preserves evidence without disrupting
    the integrity of the data on the system under investigation. Evidence from a forensic
    image can help security professionals learn what the threat was and how it exploited
    vulnerabilities. Then, in time, it can provide the information necessary to develop
    signatures, safeguards, and proactive blocking measures. For instance, determining
    that an attacker was after specific intellectual property on one critical system
    tells defenders to protect that system’s data. If forensics determines that the
    attack succeeded and sensitive data was compromised, the organization can use
    that knowledge to determine its strategic business response. If the threat failed,
    the organization can prepare for possible follow-up attacks. Forensic indicators
    might also provide an understanding of who was responsible for the threat, further
    dictating the response. An organization’s strategy should take into account the
    severity of the threat—for instance, whether the attacker was a foreign government,
    a disgruntled employee, or a kid performing harmless notoriety hacking.

    as *live analysis* or *live acquisition*) and *imaging* (also *forensic imaging*
    or *mirroring*). Organizations use honeypots and other deceptive virtual environments
    to live capture and even interact with attackers. Such systems are often configured
    to lure in hackers or be easily accessible to malware so that when the threat
    infiltrates the system, hidden logging and monitoring controls capture exactly
    what the threat does and how, along with other observables. Unfortunately, many
    attackers are aware of these honeypots and perform tests to determine whether
    they are inside a simulated environment meant to collect intelligence. If their
    suspicions are confirmed, attackers will behave differently or cease operations,
    undermining the security team’s efforts. Network access control (NAC) devices
    can also contain live threats by dynamically switching a system to an infected
    VLAN, where it remains online and “live” while defenders respond.

    the initial stage, reconnaissance, the threat looks for the presence of capturing
    technology, only loading malware and tools after it validates that it can operate
    safely within the environment. Such precautions are necessary for the threat actor.
    If a successful capture and forensic analysis occurs, the threat’s tools and techniques
    can be shared with other organizations and defenders, allowing them to learn from
    the attack, patch against it, or develop countermeasures. Law enforcement may
    even use forensic capture tactics to track down or provide evidence against threat
    actors.

- en: Recently, sophisticated actors have moved laterally into computer and network
    areas that standard forensic imaging, capture, and analysis tools do not or cannot
    inspect. These actors’ innovations include installing hard drive firmware that
    creates a hidden, encoded filesystem; embedding malware in BIOS storage; leveraging
    local microchip storage to operate outside normal working memory; and changing
    low-level modules and code on networking gear such as routers, switches, smart
    printers, and other devices not traditionally inspected by or even practical for
    forensic imaging. Certain threats imitate core OS or trusted security components
    by infiltrating the original manufacturer, who is inherently trusted and not considered
    for forensic analysis. Others hide by deleting forensic evidence, moving to the
    memory of a system that does not reset often—such as a domain controller—and then
    waiting for forensic scrutiny on the systems of interest to subside before returning
    to the intended target.

    It sometimes takes days before the quarantined machine can be shipped to that
    person for examination, and by then, the attack is no longer a live representation
    of the current threat. This inability to operate at the same speed as the threat,
    or faster, leaves defenders relegated to the role of a forensic janitor—the person
    who collects evidence and cleans up infections after the threat actor has already
    achieved their objectives. Proactively establishing capabilities, traps, and ambushes

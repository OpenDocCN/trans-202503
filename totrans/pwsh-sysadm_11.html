<p class="snoindent"><span class="bign">If <a href="part1.xhtml#part1">Part I</a> felt more like a school exercise than something practical—the kind of thing you can do today, right here, right now—don’t worry, you’re not alone! I felt the same way. But you can’t always dive in headfirst; sometimes it’s good to test the water before you jump in. And that’s what <a href="part1.xhtml#part1">Part I</a> accomplished—giving an introduction for those who are new to PowerShell and a refresher for those who aren’t.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In <a href="part2.xhtml#part2">Part II</a>, you’ll finally get to the fun stuff, taking what you’ve learned in <a href="part1.xhtml#part1">Part I</a> and <em>applying</em> those skills to real-world scenarios. You’ll walk through how to use PowerShell to automate some common scenarios many tech professionals deal with every day. If you’re a seasoned tech professional, you’ve undoubtedly encountered some of these scenarios before: sleepily clicking your way through an Active Directory, spending way too much time copying and pasting between Excel sheets, freaking out as you try to rig up some remote-controlled software to connect a dozen machines at a time so you can get management that info they wanted two days ago.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_114"/>In this part of the book, you’ll learn the tools you need to automate tasks like these. Of course, I can’t cover everything—there’s just too much boring stuff to automate! What follows are a few common scenarios I’ve encountered in my 20 years in the industry. If your particular problem isn’t covered, don’t fret! By the end of this book, you’ll have the foundation you need to figure out how to automate tasks for yourself.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="part2.xhtml#part2">Part II</a> is broken into four main topics covered in five chapters.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3">Working with Structured Data</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Data is everywhere. If you’ve worked with it before, you know it comes in a million formats: SQL databases, XML files, JSON objects, CSVs, and all the rest. Every type of data has its own specific structure, and each structure has to be handled differently. In <a href="ch10.xhtml#ch10">Chapter 10</a>, you’ll learn how to read, write, and modify various forms of data.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3">Automating Active Directory Tasks</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Active Directory (AD) is a directory service. At a high level, you can think of a <em>directory service</em> as a hierarchical way to keep track of which IT resources a user can access. AD is Microsoft’s version of a directory service, and as you might imagine, it’s used by thousands and thousands of organizations all over the world, making it an area ripe for automation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11</a> covers the basics of how to manage various AD objects from the PowerShell console. Once you get used to the AD cmdlets, we’ll walk through a few small projects that will help you use various AD cmdlets to automate some of the most mundane tasks you’re likely to see.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3">Controlling the Cloud</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Like almost every kind of technology these days, the cloud is heavily supported by PowerShell. Understanding how PowerShell works in cloud environments, including Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS), will open up shiny new frontiers to automate. In <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12">Chapters 12</a> and <a href="ch13.xhtml#ch13">13</a>, you’ll create virtual machines, web services, and more. You’ll even see an example of using PowerShell to interact with both cloud providers at once. Since PowerShell is indifferent to which cloud we use (it’s <em>cloud-agnostic</em>), we have the ability to control any cloud we want!</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3">Creating a Server Inventory Script</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Because the content in this book is cumulative, you’ll need a solid foundation before attempting the whirlwind of technical wizardry that is <a href="part3.xhtml#part3">Part III</a>. That’s what <a href="ch14.xhtml#ch14">Chapter 14</a> is all about, combining all the know-how you’ve gathered over the course of this book and turning it into a single project. Here, you’ll learn how to combine disparate sources of information into a single, cohesive <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_115"/>report. This will entail querying computers from AD and interrogating them with CIM/WMI to access useful information such as name, RAM, CPU speed, operating system, IP address, and more.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3">Summary</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">By the end of this part, you should have a good idea of the kinds of mundane tasks you can use PowerShell to automate. Having automated a couple of them yourself, you’ll see that there’s really no need to shell out for expensive software or fancy consultants to manage your environment. PowerShell can complement hundreds of products and services—where there’s a will (and PowerShell), there’s a way.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_116"/></p>&#13;

<p class="tni">Coding is the process of creating instructions that computers can understand and execute. It has revolutionized the way we live and work. Coding powers almost every modern device, from software, websites, mobile apps, smartwatches, and smartphones to the Mars rover exploring a distant world 140 million miles away.</p>
<p class="tx">Here are some reasons you may want to learn to code:</p>
<p class="runinpara"><b class="calibre6">Build valuable skills</b> In today’s digital age, coding is a highly sought-after ability that opens up numerous career opportunities. It also helps you improve your critical-thinking and problem-solving abilities.</p>
<p class="runinpara"><b class="calibre6">Automate tasks</b> You can code programs that perform repetitive tasks faster and more accurately than humans. For example, many manufacturing processes are now done by robots that follow coded instructions.</p>
<p class="runinpara"><b class="calibre6">Quickly analyze large amounts of data</b> Coding skills are essential for analysts working with increasingly large quantities of data. You can use coding to extract insights from large datasets and to help make data-driven decisions.</p>
<p class="runinpara"><b class="calibre6">Build your own projects</b> Programming your own software, websites, or mobile apps can be a fun and rewarding way to bring your ideas to life, express your creativity, and earn some extra money.</p>

<h2 class="h" id="sec2"><span id="h1-2"/><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">Why Kotlin?</span></h2>
<p class="tni">Kotlin is a modern, general-purpose programming language first officially released in 2016 by JetBrains, its parent company. Kotlin was named after Kotlin Island, near Saint Petersburg in the Baltic Sea. This follows the tradition of Kotlin’s parent language, Java, which, according to some sources, was named after an island in Indonesia.</p>
<p class="tx">Kotlin runs on the same platform as Java, the Java Virtual Machine, and is fully compatible with Java. However, Kotlin is much more concise and expressive, with its own unique features. As a relatively new programming language, it has had the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, meaning it incorporates some of the best features from other popular languages that predate it. It provides many ways to reuse code between multiple platforms, <span aria-label="xxiii" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xxiii" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and its clean language design and powerful features offer a pleasant developer experience.</p>
<p class="tx">Here are some of the key advantages of Kotlin:</p>
<p class="runinpara"><b class="calibre6">Easy to learn</b> Because Kotlin’s syntax is concise and easy to read, you can learn it more quickly than many other programming languages.</p>
<p class="runinpara"><b class="calibre6">Versatile</b> Kotlin is widely used for mobile applications (especially Android apps), but you can also use it to develop full-stack web and cross-platform applications that run on Windows, Mac, or Linux devices.</p>
<p class="runinpara"><b class="calibre6">Safe</b> Kotlin’s type system helps you avoid null pointer exceptions and common errors that are difficult to handle in other programming languages such as Python, C, and C++.</p>
<p class="runinpara"><b class="calibre6">Supports multiple programming styles</b> You can choose your preferred way to code in Kotlin, whether procedural, structured, object oriented, or functional. You can also combine different styles as needed. (Projects in this book use elements of all these styles.)</p>
<p class="runinpara"><b class="calibre6">Interoperable with Java</b> You can use Kotlin alongside Java, meaning you can use Java code and libraries in Kotlin programs, which makes it easier to migrate from Java to Kotlin. Many enterprise-level applications were written in Java and are now being migrated to Kotlin for easy maintenance. As an additional benefit, Java libraries are more mature, and Kotlin can use them while new Kotlin-specific libraries are being developed.</p>
<p class="runinpara"><b class="calibre6">Popular</b> Kotlin is one of the fastest-growing programming languages and has become very popular since Google recognized it as the preferred language for Android app development. Kotlin developers are in high demand in the software industry.</p>
<p class="tx">In short, Kotlin is a versatile programming language that can be used for both commercial and noncommercial applications. It’s beginner-friendly and suitable for first-time learners who want to explore its features and build their programming skills while solving real-world problems.</p>

<div class="calibre7"/><h2 class="h" id="sec3"><span id="h1-3"/><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">Who Is This Book For?</span></h2>
<p class="tni">This book is for anyone who wants to learn how to use a fun, modern programming language to tackle real-world problems that cannot be solved manually. It does not assume any prior coding knowledge, though familiarity with another programming language will help you move through the covered topics more quickly.</p>
<p class="tx">This book is not a traditional textbook on coding, nor is it a comprehensive reference manual on Kotlin. Instead, it teaches you to think systematically and strategically, helping you develop problem-solving strategies before diving into code development.</p>
<p class="tx">This book takes a hands-on approach. Throughout the book, you’ll learn by working through numerous examples, full-length projects, and <span aria-label="xxiv" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xxiv" role="doc-pagebreak"/>exercises. You’ll use fundamental principles from math and science to construct simplified mathematical descriptions of the underlying problems (we call them models), and then develop Kotlin applications to solve those problems efficiently and quickly. In addition, the book’s projects demonstrate core concepts from numerical analysis and computer science, such as convergence and stability, time and space complexity, recursion, sorting, searching, and several nature-inspired stochastic optimization techniques.</p>
<p class="tx">This book does not cover advanced Kotlin topics such as generics, extensions, type aliases, or coroutines, which are more suitable for complex applications. It also does not cover computer science concepts such as advanced data structures and design patterns, or how to develop Android apps with Kotlin. It’s impossible to cover all that ground in a single book. Instead, this book will help you master essential Kotlin features and skills that will prepare you for further learning and exploration.</p>

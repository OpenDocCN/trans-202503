    take stock of any requirements or restrictions. Evaluation *requirements* could
    come from external regulatory bodies (such as a state insurance commission) or
    be contractual (such as an agreement with a vendor or outside party). An organization’s
    cyber insurance carrier, for example, may state that in order to maintain coverage
    or see a favorable premium, the organization must conduct a tabletop exercise
    on an annual basis and document it with a report containing the scenario outline,
    attendees, and key recommendations. Alternatively, the organization’s risk management
    team may require that the development team create a report with identified recommendations,
    named stakeholders, and parties responsible for addressing any shortcomings.
  prefs: []

    on the evaluation process. For example, the legal team may express reservations
    about putting certain information in writing. If sensitive data were stolen during
    a cybersecurity incident and there was a written document citing a high likelihood
    of this data being stolen, it could create a legal risk. For this reason (among
    others), the development team should confer with the organization’s legal resources
    to understand any requirements or restrictions prior to creating any documentation.

    recommendation in the final report. Alternatively, staff members may have repeatedly

- en: Many managers and developers dream of one-shot security solutions. They believe
    that a secure device results from *just activating* a protection feature in the
    OS kernel or by *just integrating* a security component into the PCB design of
    the product. Clearly, thatâ€™s wishful thinking. Engineering secure devices requires
    focus and attention from development to device production to daily operation.

- en: The third part of this book covers concepts that can have a strong impact on
    device security, like system integrity, reliable update procedures, and robustness
    even under attack. Further, intelligent access control management and system monitoring
    can significantly reduce the impact of vulnerabilities. However, all of these
    succeed only if considered and implemented comprehensively.

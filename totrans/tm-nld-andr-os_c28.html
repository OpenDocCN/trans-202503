<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">P</span>artnerships were critical for Android, and still are. One of the keys to Android’s growth was that it wasn’t just <em>Google</em> shipping Android phones; it was <em>everyone</em>.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c28-footnote-1" id="c28-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In the early days, several people were working on different aspects of partnerships and business deals. Andy Rubin had ideas about whom to work with and how to make this strategy succeed. After all, he co-founded and ran a successful mobile device company (Danger). But there was also Android co-founder Nick Sears, recently from T-Mobile, who was instrumental in signing T-Mobile as the Android launch partner for the G1. Hiroshi Lockheimer was crucial in partnership relationships as well, in project-managing the development of Android on partner devices. Rich Miner, another Android co-founder, had come from Orange Telecom, where he had worked with carriers and had run a venture fund that invested in mobile and platform companies (including Danger). In addition to managing the engineering teams working on the Android browser and speech recognition, Rich was part of the business team that helped make the deal for the Motorola Droid, along with Hiroshi and Tom Moss.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c28-0001">Tom Moss and the Business Deals</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Tom Moss worked on many of the key business deals in early Android, but he didn’t come into Google on the business side. “I actually started on Android as a lawyer. I am the worst of everything. We destroy the world.”</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_270" title="270"/>Tom started in May of 2007 in Google’s legal department. One of his specialties, prior to Google, had been open source technology. As soon as he started, he was told that he’d be working on an open source project called Android, which was launching an SDK that Fall.</p>
<p>“One of my first deals was Qualcomm, doing the license for the 7200 AMSS chipset code, to create Linux drivers that we could release. It was super complicated at the time because Qualcomm was scared to death of open source.”</p>
<p>Tom originally helped out from the legal side but ended up doing deals directly. “I started supporting Andy on deals, and Rich Miner and some of the others as a lawyer. More and more, Andy would just leave me alone: ‘Here’s the deal we need. Go do the deal.’ Andy was busy, so he wouldn’t want to sit through all of the negotiations and everything.”</p>
<p>He also worked on a strategy of how to connect all the different stakeholders: app developers, handset manufacturers, carriers, and platform software teams. One of the tricks with open source software is motivation; why would any of these partners care about the Android platform except Google? “How do you get everybody incentivized and invested into this ecosystem in a way that would maintain compatibility?”</p>
<p>Of course, app developers would care deeply about compatibility. Being able to run the same application across different implementations of Android would be a far cry better than what developers faced on platforms like Symbian and Java ME, where apps would frequently need to be rewritten to work across different devices. But the dynamics for manufacturers were different, and they were used to a world where they were responsible only for their own devices and implementations.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Google had popular apps that manufacturers wanted on their devices, including Maps, YouTube, and the web browser. So Tom hammered out a system where access to those apps was an incentive for partners to maintain compatibility by shipping Android as-is, rather than shipping a forked version of it.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c28-footnote-2" id="c28-footnoteref-2">2</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c28-0002"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_271" title="271"/>Moving Around</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Since Tom’s job had become more about making deals than legal work, he moved into a group called New Business Development (NBD) that specialized in helping various Google teams on the business side. He continued working solely for Android, but still didn’t report into Android directly.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Andy needed a team in Japan to help with development issues there (including internationalization and keyboard support). Tom volunteered to help. The move made sense for him since many of the deals he worked on were in Asia anyway. He transferred to the Google Tokyo office and hired a team of engineers, missing the G1 launch that happened in California just two weeks after he moved.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Andy wanted to have more direct visibility into Tom’s work for Android, so Tom transferred to the Android team. This meant, for silly reasons related to Android being part of a large company, that Tom had to be reclassified as an engineer. “I was, I believe, the first business person at Google to move to the engineering ladder.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c28-footnote-3" id="c28-footnoteref-3">3</a></sup> So I was an engineer on paper. To be clear, I never wrote any code.”</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c28-0003">Launching Partner Devices</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Meanwhile, from the Tokyo office, Tom was busy helping partners in that part of the world. “I did Japan. We launched Australia, I think Singapore.</p>
<p>“Google had an interesting role back then. To launch a phone, it’s just a carrier buying a phone from an OEM, a handset manufacturer. But we were integral to a lot of these deals in terms of putting our brand or marketing either on the box, or the phone, or just on marketing campaigns. We set up these deals to create the momentum for Android. We would negotiate with the carrier. We would negotiate with the handset manufacturer.</p>
<p>“I’ll give an example. I would go negotiate the deals to get the right content on the phone, the right apps or services, negotiate with the carrier, which was Docomo, negotiate with HTC. And then we worked on the marketing campaign with them. Monma-san [an engineer on Tom’s team] and I proofread the translations of the user manual in both Japanese and English and made comments and fixed the really silly mistakes they had, like ‘The <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_272" title="272"/>battery was consumable,’ like you could eat the battery. We did everything. We did every part of everything that was necessary to launch a product.”</p>
<p>Jeff Hamilton noted that this approach to global partnerships was how Android got to the scale that it has. “There are like two billion<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c28-footnote-4" id="c28-footnoteref-4">4</a></sup> devices out there. One company can’t build that many devices and support them all. Especially the variety of things: different devices that people want, different price points, configurations, all that kind of stuff. It’s a huge variety. By doing the open source thing and having one stack that supported that and having partners set up the factories that build out the things required—for networks in Turkey or whatever, the different requirements—one company can’t take all of that on. There are different requirements in different regions. We scaled that by having different companies pick that up and take that on.”</p>

<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c28-footnoteref-1" id="c28-footnote-1">1.</a></sup>  Okay, so maybe not everyone. There’s a mobile device company in Cupertino that is not currently an Android partner.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c28-footnoteref-2" id="c28-footnote-2">2.</a></sup>  Shipping an un-forked version of the platform eventually became an incentive all on its own, after Android became widespread. Manufacturers benefit from apps running the same on their devices as they do everywhere else, without requiring developers to change those apps just for their unique implementation.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c28-footnoteref-3" id="c28-footnote-3">3.</a></sup>  Maybe this is a secret strategy for passing the Google engineering interview: come in as a lawyer and transfer. You didn’t hear it from me.</p></aside>

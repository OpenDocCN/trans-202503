    he worked at Carl Zeiss AG on robotics. He later took a job with Apple, where

    Steve left, around 1.0, Hiroshi Lockheimer took over. Andy depended on this management

    video games. When she was in third grade, her parents decided that she played
    enough games and that they wouldn’t buy any more for her. “Heck,” she thought.
    “If I can’t buy a game, maybe I could try to figure out how to make my own.” She
    spent much of the next year at the library, reading programming books and playing
    around with the computer at the library, until she’d saved enough money from household
    chores to get her own computer at home.'

    dealing with ways to manage unstructured data. The second of these companies,
    Applied Semantics, was acquired by Google in 2003 for their advertising technology,
    which eventually became Google’s AdSense product.

    Google Checkout, and finally joined the Android team in 2007, around the time
    that the public SDK was first released.

    with the media team. She managed relationships with external companies and their
    technologies, including PacketVideo (which provided the software that powered
    Android’s video capabilities) and Esmertec.

    including a music app as well as an Instant Messaging (IM) client. There were
    a lot of details to getting that app to work correctly with the underlying messaging
    platform on Android, as well as with the late changes in UI design, and Peisun
    joined the team for trips to Beijing and Zurich to work with the Chengdu, China–based
    engineering team of Esmertec to get those details right.

    had brought a suitcase entirely filled with hot sauce. Chengdu, in the Sichuan
    province, is known for its spicy food, and Zurich is . . . not. The suitcase full
    of spice was seen as an important workaround for the current situation of living
    in Zurich for those two weeks.

    Dalvik launch schedules, helped get some of the early fonts for the device, and
    helped out with the hardware team in testing devices for FCC approval. This kind
    of multi-project work wasn’t unusual on the team at the time: “Back then it wasn’t
    like, ‘This person’s on this team—it was just like whatever help needed was required.
    Whoever was available just jumped in.”'

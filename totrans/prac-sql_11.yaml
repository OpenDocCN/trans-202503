- en: In this chapter, we’ll explore SQL statistical functions along with guidelines
    for using them. A SQL database usually isn’t the first tool a data analyst chooses
    when they need to do more than calculate sums and averages. Typically, the software
    of choice is a full-featured statistics package, such as SPSS or SAS, the programming
    languages R or Python, or even Excel. But you don’t have to discount your database.
    Standard ANSI SQL, including PostgreSQL’s implementation, offers powerful stats
    functions and capabilities that reveal a lot about your data without having to
    export your dataset to another program.

    surface here. Nevertheless, you’ll learn how to apply high-level statistical concepts
    to help you derive meaning from your data using a new dataset from the US Census
    Bureau. You’ll also learn to use SQL to create rankings, calculate rates using
    data about business establishments, and smooth out time-series data using rolling
    averages and sums.

    you learned in Chapter 6, a median value is the midpoint in an ordered set of
    numbers, where half the values are larger than the midpoint and half are smaller.
    Because averages can be skewed by a few very large or very small values, government
    reporting on economic data, such as income, tends to use medians.

    as *r*) measures the strength and direction of a *linear relationship* between
    two variables. Variables that have a strong linear relationship cluster along
    a line when graphed on a scatterplot. The Pearson value of *r* falls between −1
    and 1; either end of the range indicates a perfect correlation, whereas values
    near zero indicate a random distribution with little correlation. A positive *r*
    value indicates a *direct relationship*: as one variable increases, the other
    does too. When graphed, the data points representing each pair of values in a
    direct relationship would slope upward from left to right. A negative *r* value
    indicates an *inverse* *relationship*: as one variable increases, the other decreases.
    Dots representing an inverse relationship would slope downward from left to right
    on a scatterplot.'

- en: In standard ANSI SQL and PostgreSQL, we calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient
    using `corr(``Y``,` `X``)`. It’s one of several *binary aggregate functions* in
    SQL and is so named because these functions accept two inputs. The input `Y` is
    the *dependent variable* whose variation depends on the value of another variable,
    and `X` is the *independent variable* whose value doesn’t depend on another variable.

- en: I wrote this book to be the one I wish I had when I started learning crypto.
    In 2005, I was studying for my masters degree near Paris, and I eagerly registered
    for the crypto class in the upcoming semester. Unfortunately, the class was canceled
    because too few students had registered. “Crypto is too hard,” the students argued,
    and instead, they enrolled en masse in the computer graphics and database classes.

- en: I’ve heard “crypto is hard” more than a dozen times since then. But is crypto
    really *that* hard? To play an instrument, master a programming language, or put
    the applications of any fascinating field into practice, you need to learn some
    concepts and symbols, but doing so doesn’t take a PhD. I think the same applies
    to becoming a competent cryptographer. I also believe that crypto is perceived
    as hard because cryptographers haven’t done a good job of teaching it.

- en: 'Another reason why I felt the need for this book is that crypto is no longer
    just about crypto—it has expanded into a multidisciplinary field. To do anything
    useful and relevant in crypto, you’ll need some understanding of the concepts
    *around* crypto: how networks and computers work, what users and systems need,
    and how attackers can abuse algorithms and their implementations. In other words,
    you need a connection to reality.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The initial title of this book was *Crypto for Real* to stress the practice-oriented,
    real-world, no-nonsense approach I aimed to follow. I didn’t want to make cryptography
    approachable by dumbing it down, but instead tie it to real applications. I provide
    source code examples and describe real bugs and horror stories.

- en: 'Along with a clear connection to reality, other cornerstones of this book are
    its simplicity and modernity. I focus on simplicity in form more than in substance:
    I present many non-trivial concepts, but without the dull mathematical formalism.
    Instead, I attempt to impart an understanding of cryptography’s core ideas, which
    are more important than remembering a bunch of equations. To ensure the book’s
    modernity, I cover the latest developments and applications of cryptography, such
    as TLS 1.3 and post-quantum cryptography. I don’t discuss the details of obsolete
    or insecure algorithms such as DES or MD5\. An exception to this is RC4, but it’s
    only included to explain how weak it is and to show how a stream cipher of its
    kind works.'

- en: '*Serious Cryptography* isn’t a guide for crypto software, nor is it a compendium
    of technical specifications—stuff that you’ll easily find online. Instead, the
    foremost goal of this book is to get you excited about crypto and to teach you
    its fundamental concepts along the way.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While writing, I often imagined the reader as a developer who’d been exposed
    to crypto but still felt clueless and frustrated after attempting to read abstruse
    textbooks and research papers. Developers often need—and want—a better grasp of
    crypto to avoid unfortunate design choices, and I hope this book will help.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But if you aren’t a developer, don’t worry! The book doesn’t require any coding
    skills, and is accessible to anyone who understands the basics of computer science
    and college-level math (notions of probabilities, modular arithmetic, and so on).

- en: 'This book can nonetheless be intimidating, and despite its relative accessibility,
    it requires some effort to get the most out of it. I like the mountaineering analogy:
    the author paves the way, providing you with ropes and ice axes to facilitate
    your work, but you make the ascent yourself. Learning the concepts in this book
    will take an effort, but there will be a reward at the end.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book has fourteen chapters, loosely split into four parts. The chapters
    are mostly independent from one another, except for [Chapter 9](ch09.xhtml#ch9),
    which lays the foundations for the three subsequent chapters. I also recommend
    reading the first three chapters before anything else.

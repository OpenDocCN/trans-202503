<span class="ChapterTitle">The Android Browser</span></h1>
</header>
<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">T</span>o understand the Android Browser application, it’s important to first understand the state of web browsing before Android.</p>
<p>Google has always cared deeply about web technology. From the beginning, Google’s main mission has been supplying results to search queries. So investing more broadly in web technology like browsers made sense; the better the vehicles are that deliver those results, the better experience Google could offer for those results. This was especially important to Google back in the early 2000s, with the state of web browsing enabled by browser companies at that time.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c17-0001">The Great Browser Wars</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">In the early days of the internet, the Netscape browser was king; desktop users would download and use Netscape because that was how you got to the web. But Microsoft came out with their own browser, Internet Explorer (IE), eventually bundling it with Windows. Bundling IE virtually guaranteed that Microsoft’s browser would become the default for most users because it came installed as part of the OS and it was (at that time) good enough. Internet Explorer even became the default browser on MacOS until Apple came out with its own Safari browser in 2003.</p>
<p>The tension between Netscape and IE was at the heart of what Wikipedia amusingly (albeit correctly) calls the “First Browser War,” which resulted in lawsuits and, ultimately, Netscape’s demise as Internet Explorer<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c17-footnote-1" id="c17-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup> took over the planet. </p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_170" title="170"/>During this time, Microsoft was essentially in the position of dictating how people could access the Web, since IE was increasingly the door through which they entered.</p>
<p>To ensure that all users had access to great web experiences, including new web technologies that were being introduced, Google started funding web browser development. At first, Google worked with the Mozilla foundation, helping out with the Firefox browser. In particular, Google contributed engineering resources by implementing or helping out with some of the improvements in that browser, including things like performance improvements, inline spell-checking, the software update system, and browser extensions. Google didn’t have an operating system on which to bundle a browser, like Microsoft or Apple, but it could provide a better browser alternative and encourage people to switch to it.</p>
<p>Google decided to push this approach further when it created the Chrome browser in 2006. It started from scratch (using the open source WebKit code base) and built an entirely new browser to enable the kind of web experience that Google wanted users to have. Google focused on adding modern web functionality and on making browsing faster.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c17-footnote-2" id="c17-footnoteref-2">2</a></sup> Google also bundled access to its search engine by default in Chrome; typing a search query in the browser’s address bar showed search results on google.com as if the user had gone to Google’s home page and typed into the search bar.</p>
<p>Chrome launched in September of 2008 and eventually got good traction. Users returned to the world of downloading a browser app instead of just using the one that came conveniently bundled with their desktop computer.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c17-0002">Android Needs a Browser</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Android’s need for a mobile browser was different from Google’s need for a desktop browser. </p>
<p>Unlike the situation with desktop browsers, the Android platform was being built from scratch. They didn’t need a better browser; they needed <em>any</em> browser. Specifically, they needed an application through which users could <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_171" title="171"/>view websites on their phones, just like they would on their desktops. They also needed a way to incorporate web content directly into other applications, because they realized that the line between mobile applications and web content was blurring.</p>
<p>For example, a mobile application may want to show content from a website to a user. Sometimes it’s better to show that content directly in the app, rather than redirecting the user off to a browser app. This dynamic not only enables a more seamless experience, but also ensures that the user doesn’t leave the app forever. Also, many developers were more familiar with HTML and JavaScript, the languages of the web, so giving them a way to create web content in mobile apps expanded the developer audience and made it possible for people to create basic Android applications more quickly.</p>
<p>The Android team created WebView to answer this need. WebView is a viewer for a web page that can be embedded inside a larger Android application. It was developed in conjunction with the Android browser because the browser is, essentially, a WebView surrounded by extra controls and UI.</p>
<p>But in the beginning, none of this existed and the platform needed all of it. So they needed a developer to pull it together. Fortunately, many of them had worked with such an engineer at Danger: Wei Huang.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c17-0003">Wei Huang and the Android Browser</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Wei had years of experience developing web browsers and developing software. But that experience didn’t start in childhood.</p>
<p>When Wei was twelve, he took a programming course. But the workings of binary math eluded him and he gave up. When his mother showed him an article about computers being the future, Wei was convinced that he’d just ruined his life.</p>
<p>Many years later, in high school, he tried programming again, this time with more success. He ended up getting a degree in electrical engineering and then fell in love with computer graphics programming in grad school.</p>
<p>After grad school, Wei got a job at Microsoft, working with other future Android people, including Steve Horowitz. Wei worked on the web browser for the WebTV and IPTV products, learning what it took to render web content on non-desktop screens. But eventually, he wanted to do something else. “Helping people watch more TV didn’t seem like a really noble thing.”</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_172" title="172"/>Steve put Wei in touch with Andy Rubin at Danger. Danger had not yet made the pivot to phones; they were still working on their “Nutter Butter” data exchange device, which didn’t interest Wei. “I wasn’t sure that was going to sell. The business model seemed a little weak. So I decided to go to AvantGo. I felt I had a more sure thing to succeed there.</p>
<p>“It was not a very bright decision.”</p>
<p>AvantGo went through an IPO shortly after Wei got there, in September of 2000, right around the time the dot-com boom was starting to implode. AvantGo suffered along with a lot of other startups. “My timing was just horrible. I caught the end of that boom and then everything crashed.” Also, the work and the culture were not quite what Wei wanted, so he looked elsewhere. “I reached out to Andy. After the VC funding, they decided to do a phone. That sounded more exciting, so I joined Danger in January of 2001.”</p>
<p>At Danger, Wei was once again working on a web browser. Danger’s phones were very limited, so the model was different from the way that browsers ran on desktop computers (or on Android phones later). Danger ran a <em>headless</em><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c17-footnote-3" id="c17-footnoteref-3">3</a></sup> browser on the server. When a user navigated to a web page in the browser app on their Danger phone, that page would render on the server. The server would then reformat the page and send down a simplified version to the phone. This approach didn’t give users complete web capability on their phones, because it lacked the dynamic capabilities of web pages. But they had a web browsing experience that was close to what they were familiar with on desktop computers and far richer than they were used to on other phones. </p>
<p>Wei spent four years at Danger, shipping browsers on a couple of Danger’s Hiptop devices. Eventually, he was ready for something new, hopefully at another startup. A friend from Danger, Chris DeSalvo, suggested he talk to Andy Rubin, who had since left Danger and was running a startup in stealth mode called Android. Wei IM’d Andy that evening. Andy asked if he wanted to join.</p>
<p>“He said, ‘Oh by the way, we’re being acquired by Google.’</p>
<p>“I had this sinking feeling, because I was looking for a startup. This was not a startup. I had to think about it. I didn’t know Google well at the time. I thought it was just a search company. I didn’t really understand the full <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_173" title="173"/>spectrum of Google’s ambitions. But the excitement Andy conveyed still convinced me to join.”</p>
<p>Wei started on the Android team at Google in September of 2005. He was the second post-acquisition employee, after his friend Chris.</p>
<p>Wei’s first project was . . . another browser. But there was a lot of work to do before he could write the browser application because Android, as a platform, didn’t really exist yet. “I downloaded the code base. I was a little surprised. How did you sell this company to Google for just a bunch of JavaScript?”</p>
<p>The first task was to pick a starting point for the browser. By the time Android began, there were multiple open source browser engines to start from, so Wei didn’t have to write the entire application from scratch. WebKit, which was based on another open source browser project, KHTML, was started by Apple and was the basis for Apple’s Safari browser. “I really liked the code base, so it was a no-brainer for me.”</p>
<p>Wei got to work building a browser based on the WebKit engine. Meanwhile, the browser team was growing, starting with management: Rich Miner.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c17-0004">Rich Miner Builds the Team</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Rich Miner, who went on to help establish many of Android’s early corporate partnerships, knew business and he knew tech. He was introduced to programming in elementary school, when the class learned Fortran on punch cards. “All of that, to this day, has me amazed at how much memory we consume in our apps, and I think of what I was doing to squeeze modified code in place.” </p>
<p>Rich first showed his crossover skills of business + engineering when he was a freshman in college. He’d written a game for his Commodore 64 computer and proceeded to sell it with the help of some friends. “My roommates and I had a cassette<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c17-footnote-4" id="c17-footnoteref-4">4</a></sup> duplication system in our dorm and made packages ourselves. I would go around and literally peddle them to local Commodore dealers. I took an ad out in one of the Commodore magazines and did email fulfillment.”</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_174" title="174"/>Rich had gone to the University of Massachusetts Lowell to study physics, but soon switched majors. “I lasted half a semester and realized I should be doing computer science. My grades were starting to reflect it too.”</p>
<p>During his undergrad years, Rich became a lead for the Center for Productivity Enhancement at the school, bringing in grants for millions of dollars from companies like Digital, IBM, and Apollo. He continued working in the lab during grad school, becoming a co-director while pursuing his PhD. One of the projects incubated at the lab led to Rich starting a company called Wildfire Communications in December of 1990. Wildfire offered, among other things, a voice-based automated assistant that could route calls and take messages. Wildfire continued for nearly ten years, until it was acquired by Orange, the French telecom company. After the acquisition, Rich started Orange Labs in Cambridge, where he was the director of research and of a new venture fund.</p>
<p>While at Orange, Rich helped launch the first Windows Mobile phone on Orange’s network. It wasn’t a positive experience because of the measure of control that Microsoft wanted over the resulting device. Rich came away from that project with the desire for an open platform for the mobile ecosystem, instead of having choices limited by platform providers.</p>
<p>Rich Miner was a co-founder of Android, and part of the business team that helped get it acquired. But once at Google, he was looking for ways to help out the growing engineering team. He took on the job of managing the nascent browser effort.</p>
<p>Rich stayed in the Boston area after Android was acquired, far away from the rest of the team in Mountain View. Google only had a small sales office in downtown Boston, so Rich lobbied Google execs Eric Schmidt (CEO) and Alan Eustace (VP of engineering) to start an engineering site. It was a hard sell. “Eric had had a bad experience with the East Coast. Sun Microsystems, under his watch, had started an eng office here. But they put it way out in the periphery, outside of the city. I had to convince him that a place near the universities could attract the best talent. We could build a great office.”</p>
<p>Rich convinced the execs, and Google started an office in downtown Cambridge down the street from MIT.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c17-footnote-5" id="c17-footnoteref-5">5</a></sup> Rich hired the first handful of engineers there, including some for Android.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_175" title="175"/>Rich hired a former employee of his from Orange Labs, Alan Blount, to join the browser team. Meanwhile, in Mountain View, Wei found another engineer for the team: Grace Kloba. Years before, when he was working at Adobe, Wei had convinced Grace to drop out of her PhD program and join him. This time, he persuaded her to leave Adobe.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c17-0005">Grace Kloba, WebView, and the Android Browser</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Grace first learned programming from her mother, who was part of the first generation in China to receive computer education, in the late 1970s. Her mother moved quickly from student to teacher; after she took a three-month intensive programming course, she returned to university to run a computer lab and teach classes on programming languages. Along the way, Grace picked up elements of BASIC and Fortran programming.</p>
<p>Grace later chose her undergrad major based on the nice facilities that the image processing lab had. It worked out well, teaching her fundamentals of both computer science and electrical engineering. After college, she came to the US for a graduate program in computer graphics at Stanford. One of her classmates at Stanford was Wei, whom she’d gone to school with ten years earlier in China.</p>
<p>Grace had passed her PhD qualification test and was searching for a thesis topic when Wei reached out to her about an opportunity at Adobe. Grace left grad school and joined Adobe for several years. Then, in 2006, Wei (now at Google) reached out again, and Grace interviewed and got an offer from Google.</p>
<p>Wei wanted Grace to work with him on the browser team, but he had to convince Steve. Android hired domain experts that had worked on embedded systems, mobile devices, and OS platforms, and Grace didn’t have that kind of experience. But Wei assured Steve that it would work out, and Grace joined the Android Browser team in March of 2006.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c17-footnote-6" id="c17-footnoteref-6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>One of the problems that Grace had to solve was making web content easier to view on the small screens that mobile phones had at the time. She <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_176" title="176"/>had experience in laying out text content,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c17-footnote-7" id="c17-footnoteref-7">7</a></sup> which came in handy when she enabled the browser to display text in a reasonable way on a small display, without the larger content area that web page authors envisioned when they wrote the original HTML content.</p>
<p>She worked on many other problems across the browser and the WebView component during her time on the team. There were, after all, only a handful of people supporting that large swath of functionality for the first several years of Android’s existence. Some of the things she implemented included multi-threaded support, improved network capabilities, and common browser UI elements like tabs.</p>
<p>There was also a last-minute project to get pinch-to-zoom<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c17-footnote-8" id="c17-footnoteref-8">8</a></sup> working for the Nexus One launch in early January of 2010. Grace returned from the holidays to find Andy Rubin asking how long it would take to implement that feature. He really wanted it for the upcoming launch, which was happening that month. Three weeks later, Grace delivered the feature, and the phone shipped with that new functionality.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c17-0006">Cary Clark and Browser Graphics</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The Android team was mostly located in a single place, in Mountain View. But the browser team was a striking exception to that rule: Grace was in Mountain View, Wei was in Seattle, and Rich and Alan were in Boston. Then the Skia team, in North Carolina, joined the browser effort after they’d finished getting their graphics engine working.</p>
<p>The browser had different drawing requirements than the rest of the Android system. Rendering graphics was something the Skia team did well, so they took on the job of rendering the browser content. For example, Cary Clark spent significant time getting web pages that were intended for desktop computers to look and react reasonably on this new, very constrained type of device.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_177" title="177"/>Cary had a long history in 2D graphics, and browsers, before he arrived on the Android team. But his background in programming went back even further. In 1968, when he was eleven years old, he got a Digi-Comp I for Christmas. This device was not a computer as we know it today, but used plastic and metal parts to perform simple boolean and math operations, like counting from zero to seven.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c17-footnote-9" id="c17-footnoteref-9">9</a></sup> Cary was so fascinated by this machine that he wore it out and asked for the same present the following Christmas.</p>
<p>He upgraded to a used Apple II in the late 70s while he was at college, spending so much time learning programming in his dorm room by taking apart Steve Wozniak’s BASIC implementation on the Apple II that he flunked out of college. He eventually came back and finished his degree, but in the meantime had started working in sales at a hobbyist computer store. When customers had questions about their Apple computers, Cary would call up the regional Apple tech support office for answers, but realized that the staff had no idea how things actually worked. So he applied for and got a job there. As part of his job in regional support, he would occasionally call Cupertino headquarters, but realized that the support staff there also didn’t know enough, so he complained loudly and eventually ended up moving to Cupertino and working in the main Apple tech support office.</p>
<p>During the development of the Lisa<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c17-footnote-10" id="c17-footnoteref-10">10</a></sup> and the Mac, Cary moved into management, while still programming on the side. But eventually he chose to do software engineering full time: “I was a terrible manager.” He was at Apple until 1994, working on various things including leading the effort on QuickDraw GX,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c17-footnote-11" id="c17-footnoteref-11">11</a></sup> which was a new 2D graphics library that was able to draw <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_178" title="178"/>much faster than the Mac’s original QuickDraw library. The code name for this project was Skia, which Cary chose from a Greek word which referred to drawing a shadow on a wall. QuickDraw GX’s main functionality was drawing outlines and filling them in, so the code name fit.</p>
<p>Cary eventually left Apple for other tech companies including WebTV, and Microsoft after the acquisition, where he worked with various future Android engineers. Cary worked on the WebTV browser, trying to make content intended for desktop computers look and interact in a reasonable way on a TV with a completely different input mechanism. He eventually moved out of Silicon Valley to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where he worked remotely for Microsoft. There he started talking with Mike Reed, whom he knew from his time at Apple. Mike pulled Cary into Openwave, where Cary again worked on browser technology. Then Mike, who had left Openwave by then, called Cary again, bringing him into his new graphics startup named Skia, in honor of Cary’s code name for QuickDraw GX.</p>
<p>When Cary started to work on the Android browser, there were a few problems that he had to solve. For example, input was complicated, figuring out how to turn keyboard, D-pad, trackball, and eventually touch events into interactions on a web page. Mike said, “The first thing that had a touchscreen still had a trackball and arrow keys. So we had to live in both worlds. It was somewhat harder on the browser, because there were two ways to set the current item of interest and focus. You could fling with your finger, or you could hit the down arrow a bunch of times. So there was some complication.”</p>
<p>One of those complications was how to navigate through the links on a web page. If the user was trying to navigate with the D-pad, there needed to be a way to go to the “next” link. So if they tapped the right button on the D-pad, the focus needed to shift to the next link to the right. But web pages don’t have a concept of links being positioned relative to each other, so it wasn’t obvious which link to focus on, based on that user input. Also, Cary had to devise a system for visually indicating that a particular link had focus, so the user knew which link would be clicked when they pressed the selection button.</p>
<p>Smooth scrolling was another hurdle. Mike said, “Apple set the expectation that everybody smooth-scrolls. We were not smooth-scrolling the very first version with trackballs and arrows. When we would scroll twenty pixels, we just popped, just like every desktop on the planet. And now suddenly, you <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_179" title="179"/>gotta smooth-scroll everything, whether it’s from a finger fling or not. That’s when we really pushed hard. Cary invented<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c17-footnote-12" id="c17-footnoteref-12">12</a></sup> the Picture<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c17-footnote-13" id="c17-footnoteref-13">13</a></sup> object, which we didn’t have in Skia until then, which is a display list. The browser could go through the display lists from all of the slow Java single-threadedness, hand it over to a different thread, and then we could fling the picture, draw as fast as we can draw, and not have to talk to the browser.”</p>
<p>Another task was just getting real-world web pages to display reasonably on small devices with limited memory. Cary had worked through related issues on the WebTV product years earlier, getting web pages intended for desktop computers to show up reasonably on TV screens. But the problems he faced for the Android browser were new: there was just too much content on web pages, including “pages that were just insanely tall. Especially when they were fit to the width of the phone screen.”</p>
<p>Cary’s favorite example from that time was the Wikipedia page for <em>cheese</em>,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c17-footnote-14" id="c17-footnoteref-14">14</a></sup><em> </em>which for some reason is a really, really long entry. “It was many hundreds of thousands of pixels tall. You couldn’t represent that number of pixels in our math system, so we had to figure out how to fix that.”</p>
<p>When that problem was addressed, another arose; even if the user could eventually see all of the content in a very long page, it took a very long time to scroll through it. So Cary implemented a system in the browser that would detect when the user was trying to scroll repeatedly and would pop up a magnifier object on the page, with a zoomed-out view of the entire page, allowing the user to quickly go to a specific location on the page.</p>

The fear of developers at that time was that web apps written for IE would run only on Windows, since there was functionality for IE that differed from that on Netscape’s browser. His response, somewhat tongue-in-cheek (but somewhat not) was that cross platform wouldn’t be a concern when everyone ran IE and Windows.</p></aside>

Early cassette devices for the C64 held about 100 kilobytes per side of the cassette and transferred data at a rate that could take up to 30 minutes to load from the cassette. Compare this size to 256MB on the original G1 in 2008 (2,500 times larger) and current gigabit internet streaming speeds (25 million times faster).

Various factors led to its failure in the marketplace, including a high price tag, sluggish performance, and competition (both internal and external) with the Macintosh. But its use of a graphical user interface was a sign of things to come, from the Mac and, eventually, Windows.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c17-footnoteref-11" id="c17-footnote-11">11.</a></sup>  I remember seeing Cary Clark give a technical presentation about Mac graphics at WWDC (Apple’s annual developer conference) way back in the early 90s. I had forgotten all about it until I ran into him on the Skia team at Google years later. Tech is a teeny, tiny, small town. A really crowded town with millions of inhabitants all over the world, but a small town nevertheless, where you keep bumping into people you’ve met elsewhere.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c17-footnoteref-12" id="c17-footnote-12">12.</a></sup>  Cary agreed that he <em>implemented</em> Picture for Skia, but not that he invented the concept. He gave that credit to Bill Atkinson, one of the engineers on the original Macintosh team at Apple who helped create the original QuickDraw 2D graphics engine for the Mac. “Bill Atkinson invented Pictures, and he probably stole it from somebody else. I was just standing on the shoulders of giants.” Most software that is written is either re-implementing existing concepts or building upon and extending them in new ways. </p></aside>

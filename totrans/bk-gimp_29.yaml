    its characteristics can be changed. Although GIMP has only one specific Preferences
    dialog, you’ll find other tools for changing parameters scattered in various places.
    In this chapter, we’ll show you how to customize GIMP so it works best for you.

    tab (right)") (left). The menu on the left in the dialog displays the list of
    preference tabs; we’ll consider each in turn. Anytime you change parameters in
    GIMP, your work is saved to a file called `gimprc` and stored on your machine,
    typically in the main GIMP directory. The changes usually take effect immediately,

    to something like half the size of your installed RAM. Experiment with different
    values. Sizes that are too small will cause GIMP to swap frequently to disk, which
    slows things down. On the other hand, values that are too large may prevent other
    applications from starting or may cause processes to fail.

    PERCEPTUAL intent, uses an interpolation system that is almost reversible (no
    important information is lost) and does not clip out the most saturated colors.
    It is well suited to work with photographs. The SATURATION intent converts saturated
    input colors to saturated output colors and is well suited to colorizing or similar
    work. You can safely ignore the two other intents, RELATIVE COLORIMETRIC and ABSOLUTE
    COLORIMETRIC. (See also [Using Color Management](ch12s03.html#using_color_management

    square, or pointed). SPIKES don’t appear on circles unless the ASPECT RATIO is

    ASPECT RATIO [1 to 20] controls the relationship between height and width and

			<p class="ChapterIntro">Wilderness survival has an undeniable allure. It’s tempting to imagine being capable of fashioning a shelter out of sticks and leaves, or hunting game with a makeshift spear. In nearly all emergencies, however, staying in built-up areas is better than running for the woods. Putting yourself in unfamiliar surroundings and at the mercy of the elements, possibly without a way to turn back or call for help, is simply not a good self-preservation strategy—not when sensible alternatives exist.</p>
			<p>
				That’s not to say that you need to remain in your home come hell or high water. In some scenarios, prompt evacuation is the right move. The point is that when you have to hit the road, the road should ideally lead somewhere familiar and safe. There’s no shame in renting a motel room or crashing with a coworker or a friend, and the supplies needed for this <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_166" title="166"/>eventuality are simple: some cash and a change of clothing will be worth more than a machete and a set of fishing lures.</p>
			<p>Of course, not all trips go precisely as planned. For one, mass evacuations may leave you stranded in endless traffic jams for hours or days. Worse, your destination may prove inaccessible, overcrowded, or unsafe in some other way. In other words, although wilderness survival should almost certainly not be your primary plan in all but the most extreme situations, it still pays to be ready to spend a night or two under the stars.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c20-0001">General Preparations</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Planning for evacuations is all about making tough choices: no matter the mode of transportation, you can never take as much as you’d like. There’s always another keepsake, another ration, or another tool that might come handy—but the only way to take it with you is to leave something else behind.</p>
			<p>Such limitations are by far the most painful when leaving on foot. If there’s no guarantee of being able to replenish water or food, your safe range may be limited to the distance you can easily cover within a day or two; for most people, that is about 30 miles. Beyond that point, the extra rations needed for the trip begin to weigh you down, offering rapidly diminishing returns. The constraints may be less severe in places where clean water is plentiful year-round, but you should beware of unreasonable optimism: not every route is teeming with pristine mountain creeks, and a squiggly blue line on a map may turn out to be nothing more than a dusty storm drain or an abandoned irrigation ditch.</p>
			<p>Compared to walking, a bicycle can usually get you farther, thanks to the increased travel speed and the greatly improved carrying capacity. Distances of around 100 miles should be attainable for any person in good health. At the same time, a bicycle is a seasonal mode of transportation, easily thwarted by snow or ice. Its range is also greatly diminished in areas with steep terrain or poorly maintained roads.</p>
			<p>The outlook is best for those leaving by car. The safe range on half a tank of gas is typically 100 to 200 miles, depending on the vehicle and the conditions on the road. If this doesn’t get you out of Dodge, you can typically bring enough camping supplies to keep a family of three content for at least a week.</p>
			<p>No matter how you’re traveling, the essentials to pack are roughly the same: cash, clothing, and a selection of the items discussed earlier in this book—food, water, a range of health and hygiene products, a flashlight with some spare batteries, and a charger for your phone. Another indispensable addition are paper maps of the region you live in, along with a good compass. These will help you orient yourself if the phone malfunctions or runs out of juice.</p>
			<p>
				It’s a common recommendation to pack the copies (or originals) of essential documents too—birth certificates, IDs, property deeds, or the insurance policy for your home. Although we live in an era when almost all <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_167" title="167"/>this information is digitally recorded and backed up, a physical copy can come in handy if the records are damaged or lost. That said, paperwork is seldom needed on the go, so for the sake of simplicity and safety, it may be better to keep the documents with a trusted friend or in a bank deposit box. Alternatively, digital copies on a thumb drive should work.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c20-0002">Setting Up a Camp</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">In principle, camping requires no special introduction. More than 40 million Americans practice it every year,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c20-endnote-1" id="c20-noteref-1">1</a></sup> and even those who prefer five-star resorts to mosquitoes usually have a pretty good command of the concepts at play. At the same time, given that camping is most often undertaken in good weather and by driving to a developed campsite, some of the nuance may be lost.</p>
			<p>For one, setting up a proper camp while bugging out on foot is a tall order. Although many hikers carry tents and sleeping bags with them for tens of miles, this is because they can carefully plan the route and take just the gear they need for that hike and for the weather they reasonably expect. In bug-out situations, that kind of precision is a pipe dream. It may be more practical to seek shelter along the way, either knocking on strangers’ doors or taking a nap under a found or improvised canopy.</p>
			<p>When traveling by car or by bike rather than walking, carrying a tent, a sleeping bag, and a pad is usually not difficult. On the flip side, the car itself offers superior shelter against rain, snow, and wind, so the need for such gear is diminished. Still, a tent may provide more room for family members to get a good night’s rest. It’s also possible for the vehicle to be stuck in a dangerous location, making it desirable to camp some distance away.</p>
			<p>Your choice of tent isn’t hugely consequential. Tents from reputable manufacturers tend to have better quality assurance and may be made from more durable materials, so it’s probably best not to go for the bargain bin. It’s good to remember that tent sizing is a bit wonky too: a model advertised as suitable for five people would likely fit only three adults comfortably. Huddling can be desirable in extreme cold, but most of the time, the party would probably prefer a bit more space.</p>
			<p>In addition to the tent itself, it’s good to carry a heavy-duty tarp and rope. The tarp can be suspended to provide shade or to protect the tent from wind or rain, or it can be placed on the ground to act as a moisture barrier if the soil is very damp.</p>
			<p>More so than tents, the choice of sleeping bags and pads is key to staying warm. Inflatable pads have excellent insulating properties and take up little space compared to foam-type products, so they’re an excellent choice—provided that you also carry a kit to patch any holes. As for sleeping bags, they should be chosen with local climate in mind, and ideally tested in the backyard on a cold night. Manufacturers provide ballpark temperature ratings, but you might end up freezing your butt off in a bag that’s toasty for somebody else.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_168" title="168"/>It’s possible to buy disposable sleeping bags sewn out of Mylar foil. Their advantage is that they’re small and lightweight, fitting in the palm of your hand and easily squeezed into even the tiniest bug-out kit. Their main disadvantage, aside from being fairly fragile, is that they’re incredibly crinkly and quickly get damp because of poor breathability. In other words, they’re a choice of last resort but not a particularly good alternative to the real deal. They’re an extremely valuable survival item on day hikes through the wilderness gone wrong, though—and for this reason, are worth having on hand.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c20-0003">Bad Weather Preps</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Human bodies exhibit two interesting adaptations that are probably related to each other. First, unlike most other animals, we can sweat profusely, allowing us to endure heat with relative ease—at least when we have enough to drink. But then, unlike most of our mammalian buddies, we lack fur—and without the right clothes, we’re extremely vulnerable to cold.</p>
			<p>The art of dressing warmly in the winter isn’t taught in schools. Instead, we rely on our instincts, and for millennia, they served us rather well. Yet, people in the developed world increasingly spend their lives indoors, with only fairly brief shuffles between warm offices, stores, and homes. In such a reality, the instincts sometimes get dull.</p>
			<p>If there’s one maxim to memorize, it’s that you get far more out of tight-fitting base layers, such as thermal underwear, than out of fluffy jackets or pants. It follows that carrying such lightweight garments in your emergency kit, along with warm socks, a beanie or a balaclava, and a pair of winter gloves, should get you through a major snowpocalypse even if you absentmindedly head to the office in a bomber jacket and dress pants.</p>
			<p>Other than the cold itself, getting your clothes wet is the most significant winter survival risk. Disposable raincoats are worth keeping within reach; the same goes for a change of socks. Shoes can get soggy when trudging through the snow, and frostbite is never far behind.</p>
			<p>
				In the summer, needs are simpler: sunglasses and a flap hat can greatly improve comfort; sunscreen to avoid unpleasant burns can be valuable too. But as hinted in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 15">Chapter 15</span>, the most important summer prep is adequate hydration and a plan to stay in the shade when it gets too hot. In some climates, this may mean traveling before dawn or after dusk. If that’s your plan, be sure to make the proper accommodations—such as carrying extra batteries for flashlights or headlights.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c20-0004">Food and Water in the Wild</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">The topics of foraging and hunting dominate survivalist lore. In my view, it’s a folly to think one would be able to live off the land when bugging out. In populated areas, wild sources of food are scarce—that is, unless we consider dumpster diving to be a foraging technique. In the wilderness, the story is messy too. In some parts of the world, wild fruit or nuts can provide <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_169" title="169"/>reasonable nourishment, but only for a brief portion of the year. Otherwise, munching on leaves, bark, or grass is mostly a waste of time: just because a plant is edible doesn’t meant that it packs any calories. Hunting may be a more viable source of energy, but inexperienced hunters will probably have little success stalking squirrels with an AR-15; not to mention, in any disaster that doesn’t involve a complete collapse of civilization, poachers still face steep fines and jail. Having said that, for those dead set on squirrel stew, trapping varmints with snares is more likely to succeed than shooting—and small wire snares can be purchased or handcrafted on the cheap.</p>
			<p>
				The procurement of water is a more realistic endeavor, and if your evacuation plans fall through, it may become a pressing issue long before the food runs out. We explored the topic of water treatment in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 15">Chapter 15</span>, but briefly: if you find a creek or a pond, Aquatabs and a lightweight one-quart cup should get you pretty close to safety.</p>
			<p>In wooded areas, campfires can provide comfort and warmth, and can be used to boil water or cook food. It follows that along with a lightweight aluminum or titanium pot and utensils, it makes sense to bring what’s needed to build a fire on the go. The prepper community is fascinated with unorthodox fire-starting techniques, but the reliability of several BIC lighters is hard to beat.</p>
			<p>Lighters or not, the difficulty of starting a fire on a rainy day shouldn’t be underestimated. To help with this, it’s good to also bring some easily ignited fuel, such as paraffin-based fire bricks (for example, Weber 7417 or WetFire); homemade solutions, such as dryer lint impregnated with petroleum jelly, should also work fine. When bugging out by car, bringing a small, collapsible butane stove might be a good idea too—although, as with lithium-ion batteries and aerosol sprays, gas cylinders shouldn’t be left inside cars that are parked in the searing sun.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c20-0005">Knives and Other Camping Tools</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">A knife is by far the most versatile camping implement—and one that invariably evokes passionate responses from gadget nerds around the globe. Many enthusiasts spend untold hours comparing grades of steel and debating the merits of different blade grinds. Fierce brand loyalty is common too, making it difficult to decide who to listen to. But for all their occasional beauty and craftsmanship, knives are also some of the simplest tools out there, facing some stiff competition from the wheel and the pointed stick. For most intents and purposes, a trashy knife from the dollar store works as well as a $5,000 heirloom with grips carved out of fossilized mammoth ivory.</p>
			<p>That’s not to say that all knives are the same; it’s just that the differences have relatively little effect on their short-term utility. Higher-grade models may be made from exotic steels that hold a sharp edge for longer or are less prone to rust. They may feature smoother opening mechanisms and a superior look and feel, or they may have more robust construction, allowing the spine of the knife to be hammered to split wood. All fine qualities, to be sure—but seldom a matter of life and death on a brief camping trip.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_170" title="170"/>For all these reasons, recommending a knife is difficult. Tastes are subjective, emotions tend to run high, and relatively few choices are truly wrong. It’s also easy to get distracted by form over function. Many low-quality knives have aggressive styling that tricks customers into thinking they’re buying not a tool for cutting rope and slicing steaks, but a mythical weapon forged deep in the bowels of Mount Doom.</p>
			<p>For folding knives, I’d start with a simple but functional drop point blade, around three inches long. A well-regarded and popular choice under $50 is the Kershaw Leek, with the company’s famous one-handed opening mechanism. On the upper end, my personal favorite is MKM Terzuola Clap, a traditional-looking Italian-made knife with a blade forged out of premium M390 steel, combining excellent rust resistance with superb edge retention. The price to pay for this pleasure is about $200.</p>
			<p>Although fixed-blade knives tend to be less versatile, they’re commonly associated with hiking and come in handy for tasks such as preparing firewood, so they aren’t an entirely frivolous addition to an emergency stash. In this category, drop point or clip point blades around five inches are probably the sweet spot; shorter blades offer little advantage over folding knives, while longer ones tend to weigh a ton and get in the way when strapped to a belt. My favorite ultra-lightweight option is the plain-blade version of the SOG Seal Pup Elite (product code E37SN-CP), selling for about $80. On the higher end, I’m partial to MKM Terzuola Jouf, made with well-regarded N690 steel and retailing for about twice as much.</p>
			<p>
				Although a knife is a tool far more than it is a worthwhile weapon, special care should be taken to understand the law. Knife regulations around the world tend to be remarkably boneheaded, with obscure rules rooted in long-forgotten moral panics. For example, the government of California bans the citizenry from possessing ninja throwing stars and lipstick-shaped knives.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c20-footnote-1" id="c20-footnoteref-1">*</a></sup> More practically, many localities put confusing restrictions on certain blade shapes, opening mechanisms, and so forth. Picking on California again: a folding knife of any length can be carried concealed (for example, inside your pocket), but any fixed-blade knife must always be in plain view. If you’ve ever purchased any pointy cutlery and carried it to the car in a shopping bag, you might be a violator of Penal Code 21310, eligible for up to a year in county jail.</p>
			<p>Knives aside, I’m unconvinced that any other basic tools deserve to be included in a camping kit. An ax or a saw is useful for bushcraft, but in most cases, there would be no need to chop down larger trees. Shovels can be useful for waste disposal, but on short timescales, it’s not a pressing need—and on balance, it may be better to pack light. Breaking-and-entering tools, such as crowbars or lockpicks, seem like a sure way to get arrested or shot. Finally, knife sharpeners, although commonly recommended, are probably overkill. A knife should stay sharp for a while, and even if it doesn’t, it can be sharpened reasonably well against any smooth rock.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c20-0006"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_171" title="171"/>Wildlife Management and Physical Security</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Right after hunting and foraging, campsite security is a major topic in survivalist circles. Many enthusiasts daydream about complex trip-wire systems or elaborate patrol routines to spot vagrants and deter bloodthirsty grizzly bears.</p>
			<p>
				In reality, not much ever happens at campsites. Bear attacks are rare, and so are visits from ax murderers. The most significant wilderness foes are insects, especially mosquitoes; carrying high-potency insect repellents (containing at least 40 percent DEET or 20 percent picaridin) is a good plan, particularly in the South. As for aggressive wildlife, dogs kill and maim far more people than bears,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c20-endnote-2" id="c20-noteref-2">2</a></sup> but bear spray is a fairly universal and reliable remedy for all kinds of furry woodland predators, so it should be included either way.</p>
			<p>
				Knives, as hinted earlier, aren’t a weapon to depend on. Although a blade may tip the scales in your favor in a tussle with a mountain lion, it won’t keep sharp claws or angry teeth sufficiently far from your fragile human flesh. As for firearms, we’ll discuss them in more detail in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Part IV">Part IV</span>, but for now, it suffices to say that despite persistent misinformation, handguns appear to work reliably against belligerent wildlife, perhaps a bit better than bear spray.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c20-endnote-3" id="c20-noteref-3">3</a></sup> That said, compared to bear spray, they also have two marked disadvantages. One is the regulatory burden placed on them in many localities; another is that they just weigh more. Ultimately, I’m not saying guns should be outright shunned or blindly embraced—it’s just that in bug-out situations, they have some cons.</p>

      <p>Man, what a story. What intrigue! What suspense! It was so astounding, I barely talked at all toward the end there. You probably noticed that. I pop in and out a lot.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>It may seem like we haven’t come all that far, but if you remember back to when you first picked up this book, you didn’t know anything about Ruby at all. You’d probably never heard of Senior Apprentices to Royal Plumbers, Hasheries, or Dagrons, let alone strings, object IDs, or methods. Now you know about all those things and more!</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>We’ve covered so much, I feel it’s only right to do one last quick review. For my own sake. Just to keep everything straight in my scattered mind. Don’t worry—it’ll be real quick; if you need a more in-depth refresher, thumb back to the earlier chapters and reread the <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch13.html#you_know_thisexclamation_mark-id00013" title="You Know This!">You Know This!</a> <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1219"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1369"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1457"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1498"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1784"/>sections (because you totally do, even if you don’t always remember every last detail).</p>&#13;
&#13;

      </div>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>We started out by learning how to install and set up Ruby. No small feat! We got Ruby up and running on our computer, learned how to run snippets of Ruby code with IRB, and discovered how to write files, called <span class="emphasis"><em>scripts</em></span>, that let us collect a bunch of lines of code and run them all at once.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>Once we figured out how to run code, the next step involved writing something that was interesting to run. Remember back when you only knew how to print strings and add numbers? When the thrill of programming was all about <code class="literal">puts</code>ing phrases and multiplying things together? Those were the days! But once you start learning to write stories that you can make happen in real life—that is, programs—you want to write bigger and better ones as quickly as you can. So we moved on to control flow (using <code class="literal">if</code>, <code class="literal">elsif</code>, <code class="literal">else</code>, and <code class="literal">unless</code>) and Booleans (<code class="literal">true</code> and <code class="literal">false</code>), and in no time flat, we were controlling the way information moved through our programs, repairing the Mysterious Pipe, and guiding Haldo through an underground maze.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>Then we were really off to the races! We started talking about Ruby loops and iterators, using methods like <code class="literal">each</code> to print out all the values in an array (which is like a list of items: <code class="literal">[1, 2, 3]</code>), update a hash (which is like a short dictionary of items and values: <code class="literal">{ name: Lou, fancy: true }</code>), and help Hank and Squeaky Jim fix the Hashery computer. We learned about ranges, which are just a series of numbers or letters (like <code class="literal">(0..5)</code> or <code class="literal">('a'..'z')</code>), and symbols, which are simply names or labels we use in Ruby. For instance, we saw them used as hash keys, as in <code class="literal">{ hamburgers: 'delicious' }</code>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>That’s when things started getting interesting! Scarlet found a python scale on the Hashery floor, leading the group on a voyage to the Carmine Pines. We met the Off-White Knight, <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1110"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1117"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1120"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1188"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1230"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1310"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1402"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1409"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1551"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1583"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1646"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1793"/>who showed us how to create our very own methods using the <code class="literal">def</code> keyword. We also saw how to do all kinds of fancy method tricks, like setting default arguments, using splat parameters, and writing methods that can take blocks by using the <code class="literal">yield</code> keyword.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>We went on to meet the Dagron, who explained Ruby objects and classes (which are just objects that create other objects). We learned about where in a program our variables could be seen and used, covering global, class, instance, and local variables. We even learned about a special Ruby value, <code class="literal">self</code>, that refers to the current object! As we dove deeper into Ruby class syntax, we covered <code class="literal">attr_reader</code>, <code class="literal">attr_writer</code>, and <code class="literal">attr_accessor</code>, which are shortcuts we can use so we don’t have to write methods to get and set instance variables every time we want to update them from outside our class.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>We also discovered (courtesy of the Queen) that some classes can <span class="emphasis"><em>inherit</em></span> from others—that is, they take on some of the properties and abilities of other classes—and that classes can let us reuse code through inheritance. We saw that classes that inherit from other classes can <span class="emphasis"><em>override</em></span> methods from their superclass—for example, a <code class="literal">GuardDog</code> that inherits from <code class="literal">Dog</code> can have its own version of a <code class="literal">bark</code> method that does something different from what <code class="literal">Dog</code>’s <code class="literal">bark</code> method does—and that we can always “reach up” to the superclass and call one of its methods using <code class="literal">super</code>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>The Queen also taught us about <span class="emphasis"><em>modules</em></span>, which are just like Ruby classes except we don’t create instances of them! They’re for mixing in behavior by using <code class="literal">include</code> or <code class="literal">extend</code>, which allow us to reuse code from lots of sources while still using only one superclass. Modules are also for <span class="emphasis"><em>namespacing</em></span>, or organizing our code so that we don’t have to cram all of it into one file.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>By using modules, we can easily control where all our variables, constants, and methods are available in our Ruby programs, and we can create classes with one superclass that inherit behavior from a whole range of sources.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>Then we voyaged on to the Refactory, where we learned how to rewrite our code to make it clearer without changing the way it behaves. We saw a bunch of cool tricks for improving our Ruby, including breaking up big methods into smaller <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1757"/>ones and removing duplicate code so that each method did one thing and did it well. We also learned about file input/output at the Refactory, including how to open, read, and write files with Ruby.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>Finally, we covered Ruby and the Internet, learning about Ruby gems, and web servers like WEBrick, and useful websites like the RubyGems site and GitHub. We saw the King, the Queen, Scarlet, and Ruben use their Ruby knowledge to catch the pythons and ultimately show them that Ruby and Python are both excellent programming languages, and you used your Ruby knowledge to arrive here, at the end of this book, chockfull of wisdom. I couldn’t be prouder! That’s the honest-to-gravy truth.</p>&#13;

        <p>These books are great for beginners.</p>&#13;
&#13;
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>Beginning Ruby, 2nd Edition,</strong></span></em></span> by Peter Cooper (Apress, 2009). This is just what it sounds like! A fantastic introduction to Ruby.</p>&#13;
&#13;
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>Programming Ruby, 4th Edition,</strong></span></em></span> by Dave Thomas, Andy Hunt, and Chad Fowler (The Pragmatic Bookshelf, 2013). This is sometimes called the “pickaxe book,” because it has a huge picture of a pickaxe on the cover. Lots of Ruby programmers say this is their go-to Ruby book, and I can promise there’s not a single question about Ruby you might have that isn’t covered in here.</p>&#13;
&#13;
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>The Ruby Programming Language</strong></span></em></span> by David Flanagan and Yukihiro Matsumoto (O’Reilly Media, 2008). Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto is the creator of the Ruby language, so he’s got lots of great insights into what Ruby can do and what makes it great. This is another awesome introductory Ruby book.</p>&#13;
&#13;
        <p><span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>Why’s (Poignant) Guide to Ruby</strong></span></em></span> by why the lucky stiff (<span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why%E2%80%99s_(poignant)_Guide_to_Ruby">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why’s_(poignant)_Guide_to_Ruby</a></em></span>). This is the Ruby book I first learned from, and if you read it carefully, you’ll see I snuck a few of why’s tricks and jokes into this very book. why’s guide is a magical, manic, illustrated guide to Ruby. When you’re done with this book, pick up that one! I promise you’ll be glad you did.</p>&#13;

Fun fact: I wrote all these courses, so they should seem pretty familiar! The only downside is that they cover a lot of the same information you’ve learned here, so they might be a little <span class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span> familiar. If you want to practice writing code and reviewing what you’ve learned, though, head on over and start typing—it’s free! (You must be 13 or older to create an account.)</p>&#13;

      <p>We talked about tons and tons of Ruby goodness, but there are a few bits and trinkets of the language we didn’t get to—mostly because they’re not quite as much fun as what we covered, plus these topics are a bit on the trickier side.

&#13;
        <p>You might have wondered during our adventures how both arrays <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> hashes know how to use the <code class="literal">each</code> method. It’s because they both mix in the <code class="literal">Enumerable</code> module, which you can use directly in your own classes to simplify your code! It includes all kinds of handy methods like <code class="literal">all?</code>, <code class="literal">any?</code>, <code class="literal">include?</code>, and <code class="literal">find</code>. You can read all about it in the official docs: <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Enumerable.html">http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Enumerable.html</a></em></span>.</p>&#13;

        <p>Regular expressions are like a mini-language inside Ruby that lets you match patterns in words or phrases. For example, you could use them to find strings that contain only uppercase letters or check whether a string is a valid email address. Regular expressions exist in many languages, but you can find some Ruby-specific information at <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/ruby.html">http://www.regular-expressions.info/ruby.html</a></em></span>. You can also use a free tool called Rubular at <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://rubular.com/">http://rubular.com/</a></em></span>. Rubular lets you test out your regular expressions in real time, so you can see what your patterns match and what they don’t.</p>&#13;

&#13;
        <p>You can keep information in your Ruby classes more secure by using the <code class="literal">private</code> and <code class="literal">protected</code> methods. These come in handy when you’re writing Ruby as part of a group or team, and while they don’t completely prevent other programmers from using methods they shouldn’t, they can help your teammates understand which methods they can rely on and which ones are still “under construction.” You can read more about the <code class="literal">public</code> and <code class="literal">protected</code> methods in the Ruby docs: <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Module.html#method-i-private">http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Module.html#method-i-private</a></em></span>.</p>&#13;

&#13;
        <p>Every now and then, we saw our Ruby code throw an error. Usually I explained why it happened and we went on our merry way, but if you think about it, that’s not always the best way to do things. Sometimes when an error (also called an <span class="emphasis"><em>exception</em></span>) happens, we want to do something about it, like set a default value or print a message to the screen. Handling exceptions in Ruby is called—you guessed it—<span class="emphasis"><em>exception handling</em></span>, and if you want to learn more about it, you can read Avdi Grimm’s <span class="emphasis"><em>Exceptional Ruby</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://exceptionalruby.com/">http://exceptionalruby.com/</a></em></span>).</p>&#13;

        </div>&#13;
&#13;
        <p>Remember when we talked about file I/O, we saw it was possible to write Ruby code that writes Ruby code? This means that Ruby has the ability to look at its own code and change it! The inward-looking part is called <span class="emphasis"><em>reflection</em></span>, and the ability for Ruby to change its own programming is called <span class="emphasis"><em>metaprogramming</em></span>. This is some of the hardest Ruby code to write, but if you’re feeling up to it, you can learn all about it from Paolo Perrotta’s book <span class="emphasis"><em>Metaprogramming Ruby</em></span>.</p>&#13;

        </div>&#13;
&#13;
        <p>We talked a little bit about fixing errors in our code, but we didn’t talk about writing tests for it or <span class="emphasis"><em>debugging</em></span> (that is, fixing) it in a systematic way. Writing tests to prove your code is correct and becoming good at debugging it are very important skills for any programmer to have. If you’re interested in learning more about both, you can read about the built-in Ruby testing library, MiniTest, in the Ruby documentation <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1674"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1734"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1743"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1804"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1879"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1954"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1958"/>at <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/minitest/spec/rdoc/MiniTest/Spec.html">http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/minitest/spec/rdoc/MiniTest/Spec.html</a></em></span>.

        </div>&#13;
&#13;
        <p>In all our Ruby programs, we really only did one thing at time: we’d set a variable and then use it, or maybe we’d iterate over an array and print each item to the screen. We never really did two things at <span class="emphasis"><em>exactly</em></span> the same time. With Ruby threads and processes, it’s possible to do two things at once! As you might imagine, juggling multiple things at once is many times harder than handling just one process at a time, so learning to use Ruby threads and processes takes some practice. If you want to learn more, you can read Jesse Storimer’s <span class="emphasis"><em>Working with Ruby Threads</em></span> (<span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.jstorimer.com/products/working-with-ruby-threads/">http://www.jstorimer.com/products/working-with-ruby-threads/</a></em></span>).

        </div>&#13;
&#13;
        <p>Finally, while we did talk about Ruby web servers like WEBrick, we didn’t talk much about creating entire websites with Ruby. You may have heard of Ruby on Rails (I mentioned it when describing Railscasts in <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch14.html#online_and_multimedia" title="Online and Multimedia">Online and Multimedia</a>), which is a big library of code made up of many gems that helps make writing websites with Ruby easier. It’s a good way to build websites and very popular, but sometimes newer Ruby programmers have trouble understanding all the things it does and decisions that went into making it. If you want to make websites with Ruby, you might want to start with a smaller, simpler program (and one of my favorites) called <span class="emphasis"><em>Sinatra</em></span>. You can find it online at <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">http://www.sinatrarb.com/</a></em></span>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
        <p>I admit it: I’ve been dragging my feet. I don’t want the book to end! But alas, I’ve dispensed all my Ruby wisdom. Now you know everything I know, plus you’ve got all the smarts and experience of the King, the Queen, Ruben, Scarlet, and all of their friends combined. I knew you could do it! I believed in you from the start. So even if the book has to end, at least it ends with me being right!</p>&#13;
&#13;
        <p>When you close this book, I want you to do one thing: fire up your own personal Computing Contraption and write yourself a Ruby program. It can do anything you want, big or small, silly or serious. Don’t worry if it breaks! The only way we learn is by writing programs and breaking them and fixing them and making them better, so it’s perfectly okay if your program breaks or doesn’t do what you want at first. You’re writing stories and poems for a machine, and the biggest part of the adventure isn’t having a finished, perfectly working program—it’s all the crazy things that happen along the way.</p>&#13;
&#13;
        <p>So go! Go write the best program you can, and have <span class="emphasis"><em>fun</em></span>. I’ll be seeing you.</p>&#13;

        <p>it means you tried to use a method that Ruby doesn’t know about. When you exit and restart IRB, Ruby forgets everything you were previously doing—so if you defined a method, exited IRB, and started it again, you’ll need to redefine that method to keep using it. (See <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch07.html#defining_your_own_methods" title="Defining Your Own Methods">Defining Your Own Methods</a> if you need a refresher on how to define methods.) If your method is from a file, make sure you load that file using the command <code class="literal">load 'your_file.rb'</code>, and if all else fails, double-check that you’ve spelled your method name correctly.</p>&#13;

        <p>it means you wrote Ruby code that’s not quite right, and IRB doesn’t know what to do with it. Double-check your code for tiny errors, like typos, missing commas between elements in arrays, or missing hash rockets (<code class="literal">=&gt;</code>) or colons in hashes.</p>&#13;

&#13;
        <p>it means you tried to do something with one Ruby type (like a string, integer, or <code class="literal">nil</code>), but Ruby expected a different type. This often happens when something is <code class="literal">nil</code> and you don’t know it; if you see this error, try <code class="literal">puts</code>ing out the values of all your variables <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1029"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1177"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1221"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1335"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1448"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1449"/>to make sure each one is the type of thing (string, integer, array, and so on) that you expect! (See <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch01.html#getting_to_know_irb" title="Getting to Know IRB">Getting to Know IRB</a> for help with the <code class="literal">puts</code> command and <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch02.html#bit_more_about_variables" title="A Bit More About Variables">A Bit More About Variables</a> for a refresher on the types of variables.)</p>&#13;

        <p>From time to time, you might see Ruby print something like this:</p><a id="pro_id00455"/>&#13;
        <pre class="programlisting">&#13;
...?&#13;
</pre>&#13;
&#13;
        <p>This means that Ruby expects you to “finish your thought.” Usually it means you pressed <span class="smaller">ENTER</span> without closing a string, or maybe the last thing you typed was a <code class="literal">+</code> or <code class="literal">-</code> sign. All you need to do is finish that thought—complete the expression you started to type, close the string or array you opened, or whatever it is Ruby is waiting for—and you’ll be all set. For example:</p><a id="pro_id00456"/>&#13;
        <pre class="programlisting">&#13;
&gt;&gt; <span class="red red">1 +</span>&#13;
...? <span class="red red">2</span>&#13;
=&gt; 3&#13;
</pre>&#13;
&#13;
        <p>If you have no idea what Ruby is waiting for, or you simply mistyped and want to start over, you can press <span class="smaller">CTRL</span>-C to tell IRB not to wait for you. You’ll get your regular IRB prompt back and can continue from there. (For more about <span class="smaller">CTRL</span>-C, see <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch13.html#investigating_the_kingdomapostrophes_web" title="Investigating the Kingdom’s Web Server">Investigating the Kingdom’s Web Server</a>.)</p>&#13;

        </div>&#13;
&#13;
        <p>Sometimes you’ll type a whole bunch in IRB and will want to clear the screen. You can do this in several ways, depending on which operating system you’re using. On a Mac, you can press ⌘-K or <span class="smaller">CTRL</span>-L, or you can type <code class="literal">system 'clear'</code> into IRB and then press <span class="smaller">ENTER</span>. If you’re using Linux, typing <span class="smaller">CTRL</span>-L or entering <code class="literal">system 'clear'</code> should work. If you’re using Windows, typing <span class="smaller">CTRL</span>-L or entering <code class="literal">system 'cls'</code> (not <code class="literal">'clear'</code>!) should do the trick.</p>&#13;

        </div>&#13;
&#13;
        <p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1910"/>If at any point you want to go back to a previous command you typed into IRB, just hit the up arrow on your keyboard! This is great if you just cleared the screen and then realize you need to retype a command, or if you mistyped a command and want to try again without retyping everything you just did.</p>&#13;
      </div>&#13;

      <div class="sect2" title="Look It Up!">&#13;

        </div>&#13;
&#13;
        <p>Finally, if you ever see an error that you don’t know how to handle, go ahead and search for it on the Internet (after you get your local adult’s permission!). Everyone gets errors, so it’s likely that someone else has already figured out how to handle any error you might run into. Even the best programmers look up things they don’t know on a daily basis. The more comfortable you get hunting for answers when you’re stuck, the happier and more productive you’ll be when writing Ruby.</p>&#13;

<p class="ReviewQuote">“<i>JavaScript Crash Course</i> is the perfect no-nonsense guide for folks who just want to roll their sleeves up and pick up the basics from scratch. It skips the distractions that often complicate a mastery of web programming, like UI frameworks, build tools, and server tech, using real projects to give aspiring web engineers a solid foundation.”</p>

<p class="ReviewQuote">“<i>JavaScript Crash Course</i> is a fun, practical, hands-on introduction that I wish I had when I was learning JavaScript. Readers can learn from the very basics all the way through making real games and applications that are relevant to ‘real-world’ development practices.”</p>

<p class="ReviewQuote">“<i>JavaScript Crash Course</i> offers practical, pragmatic, and project-based education on how to think about and work with JavaScript. Nick Morgan has the experience to introduce you to the language with examples that build on each other, and he quickly dives into creating real projects. As you delve deeper into the book, you’ll realize that your building blocks are the internet itself. You’ll find yourself using audio and sound generation techniques, painting with the Canvas API, and pulling in third-party JavaScript libraries. By the time you complete the crash course, you’ll be ready to start your own projects. Nick is providing a wonderful service with his hands-on teaching, both here and in <i>JavaScript for Kids</i>. I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did.”</p>

<p class="ReviewQuote">“Nick has managed to condense the foundational concepts of JavaScript into concise, approachable descriptions that are easily accessible to beginners. Throw in some fun lessons in graphics and sound to create a game, and you’ve got an excellent and engaging JavaScript book that’s well worth your time.”</p>

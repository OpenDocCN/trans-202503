<p class="noindent">After two searches through the full set of transfers, Frank still hadn’t found anyone suspicious. More precisely, he hadn’t found anyone who had any clear involvement in the plot. Frank was at least a little suspicious of everyone.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Hey, Notation’s in here,” remarked Socks on their second pass through.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank sighed. “Of course she’s in there, Socks. She just graduated from the academy. This is a ledger of officers from the academy.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“She did pretty well in school, didn’t she?” asked Socks as he skimmed her transfer papers.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Focus, Socks,” said Frank. “Remember, we’re looking for anything <em>suspicious</em>.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Three recent graduates transferred to the castle,” offered Socks. “Maybe we should look into one of them. Gretchen thinks—”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“No.” Frank cut him off with a shake of his head. He’d already seen those transfers, and they were all completely clean. Between the three of them, there wasn’t so much as a single citation for non-regulation-length toenails.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_176"/>“There’s nothing here,” Frank said at last. As Socks began to protest, Frank cut him off again. “You should go back to my office. I’ll meet you there after I brief the captain, and we can go over whatever leads are left.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank thought he saw a look of relief pass over Socks’s face, but wasn’t sure if he was just projecting it. He had known rookies to fake appendicitis to the point of actually going though with the surgery just to miss a single weekly briefing.</p>&#13;
<p class="center">_____________________</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Instead of heading straight up to the captain’s office, Frank returned to the record room. The captain had given him the official report, but Frank hadn’t had a chance to investigate the scene of the crime himself. Maybe he’d get lucky and find a clue.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The record officer was a rookie by the name of John Cache who, after grudgingly allowing him into the room, trailed after Frank with a vigilant eye. Perhaps after the theft the station had tightened its security, though Cache’s behavior was probably just due to rookie eagerness. Every rookie fantasizes about foiling crimes and saving the day on at least a weekly basis.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0176-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Under the pretense of looking for information about a lost dragon, Frank scanned the shelves of books. As expected for a station of this <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_177"/>size, the volume of paperwork was enormous. Paperwork seemed to grow quadratically with the size of any government organization, and the capital police station had more officers than any other two stations combined. Even without the stolen scrolls, the room was packed full.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Luckily, the record officers kept the information well organized. As per the king’s regulation <em>The Storage of Paperwork and Other Flat Work Products for Agencies of More Than 10 People</em>, every document was categorized and stored by subject. Large portions of shelves were dedicated to such topics as arrest reports, expense reports, transfers, guard rotations, and noise complaints.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The room itself was organized like a giant <em>trie</em>. Tries, also known as <em>prefix trees</em>, are data structures that allow efficient searches over sets of strings. Conceptually similar to binary search trees, tries start at a root node and branch out as they move down. However, tries are optimized for searching strings instead of numeric values. At each node, the trie splits the data based on the question “What is the <em>next</em> letter in the string?” Thus, each node in a trie can have many children, one for each letter in the alphabet. This structure lets you efficiently search for any string by following a single path down the trie, choosing the next node based solely on the next letter in your target string.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank had once seen a demonstration of a magic trie at a wizards’ convention. The neon orange tree had hung in the air, storing the names of the thousand potion ingredients carried by that vendor. For simplicity, the trie showed only the non-empty branches. Customers could use the trie to quickly determine which ingredients were in stock. For example, they could see the vendor carried <em>batnip</em> by taking the B, A, T, N, I, then P branches. And they could quickly tell that <em>baby powder</em> was out of stock because the subtree under BA didn’t have a branch corresponding to B.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_178"/><img src="../images/f0178-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">The record room took the concept of tries and applied it to shelving. Twenty-six massive bookshelves lined the walls, each holding records starting with a single letter. They were the trie’s first level of nodes. First was the A shelf, followed by the B shelf, and so forth.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0178-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Next, each bookshelf contained individual shelves, each of which corresponded to the second letter of a subject. These shelves made up the trie’s next layer.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0178-03.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_179"/>Because most two-letter combinations didn’t correspond to existing entries, the bookshelves didn’t need 26 individual shelves. Frank had heard stories of record officers killing time by inventing new subjects to fill the gaps. Apparently, a senior officer had received a long lecture from the captain on the seriousness of police work after she had suggested filing the speed limits under “Zoom policies.” The Z bookcase still lacked a ZO shelf today.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The shelves were then arranged horizontally with labeled book-ends representing the third level of the trie.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As he walked, Frank glanced over at the V shelf. During his time on the force, he had successfully lobbied to have the Vinettees occupy an entire subject of their own. He had spent many nights poring over the files in bookcase V, shelf I, section N.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank stopped at the D bookcase and located shelf R, section A. He pulled out a book on Dragon Registrations and pretended to skim it, while examining the rest of the room.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The captain’s description of the crime had been accurate. Entire shelves of records had been swept clean, stripped of all scrolls corresponding to certain two-letter prefixes. Other bookcases were completely untouched. From his current vantage point, Frank could see empty shelves for the prefixes AS, CE, EX, NO, PR, and RO. He made a mental list of these prefixes. Whatever information the thief was after had those prefixes. And Frank had another lead.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">He replaced the book on Dragon Registrations and announced loudly, “Good news! There are only a few Pigeon Eaters registered in the capital, and plenty of pigeons. At least the poor thing won’t starve while I find it.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">John Cache gave him a pitying look but said nothing as Frank strode from the records office.</p>&#13;

<p class="sidebart"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_180"/><strong>POLICE ALGORITHMS 101: TRIES</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="sbsub"><em><strong>Excerpt from Professor Drecker’s Lecture</strong></em></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Tries are tree-based data structures that allow the user to efficiently search for strings based on the string’s prefix. Like binary search trees, tries start at a root node and branch out as they progress downward. In tries, each branching decision is based on the next element of the string. Thus, a node in a trie can have more than two children.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0180-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">As with a binary tree, we only need to include nodes that have data. This example is constructed from the words <em>zap</em>, <em>zen</em>, <em>zone</em>, and <em>zoom</em>. Since we don’t include <em>zonk</em>, we don’t need to have a subtree under the K branch of ZON.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Note that we don’t need to store the actual prefixes in the nodes; they can be reconstructed from the path through the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_181"/>tree. However, it can be useful to store one additional bit of information in each node: whether that node represents the end of a valid word. This allows us to distinguish between inserted words and prefixes of inserted words. For example, we could tell whether the word <em>zoo</em> had been inserted into a tree that also contains the word <em>zoom</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Searching a trie is similar to searching a binary search tree. An algorithm starts at the top of the trie and progresses downward. At each node, the algorithm selects the branch corresponding to the next letter in the target string. For example, if we were searching for <em>zen</em>, we would follow the path from Z, through the branch for E, and then the branch for N.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0181-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_182"/>If there is no such element, we know that the value of interest is not in the tree. So, if we were searching this tree for <em>zany</em>, we would hit a dead end after ZA.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">One surprisingly common use of tries in policing is to compile a list of possible suspects. You’d be surprised by how frequently an informant refuses to provide a whole name, yet is comfortable providing the first few letters. In these cases, we can search the trie for that prefix and list all names in the corresponding subtree. Depending on the number and the rarity of the letters, this may be enough information to drastically limit the search.</p>&#13;

- en: Among vector editors, Inkscape is one of the best for sketching and freehand
    drawing, thanks to its versatile Calligraphic pen tool ([14.2](c14.xhtml#section14.2)).
    Far from being geometrically perfect and lifeless like other vector tools, the
    Calligraphic pen has character—but it is still a vector tool that produces always
    editable vector objects.

    entirely in Inkscape. I'll draw a funny, cartoon running horse that might be a
    mascot or a comic character. I've always found it challenging to draw anything
    from scratch, and I imagine many readers can sympathize. Yet with Inkscape, I
    was able to make a drawing I actually liked.

    and a **Thinning** of 0.2 in the tool's controls bar ([14.2](c14.xhtml#section14.2)).
    If you have a graphics tablet, enable the pen pressure for varying the stroke
    width ([14.2.1.1](c14.xhtml#section14.2.1.1)). The Angle and Fixation parameters
    make sense only for calligraphy, not freehand drawing, so set the **Fixation**
    to 0—this effectively turns a fixed-angle pen into a round brush that has no orientation
    ([14.2.2](c14.xhtml#section14.2.2)).

    make this brutally obvious. With a beginning like this, I imagine many would have
    been tempted (as was I) to give up immediately. But patience and hard work pay
    off—especially in Inkscape. Just keep throwing strokes onto the canvas, undoing,
    tweaking, and stroking again. Sooner or later, something not *entirely* awful
    will flash through the tangle of bad lines ([Figure 23-1](#fig23-1)).

    to visualize on your own how a horse's body curves or which way the legs bend.
    I found that photos of real horses were of little help; much more inspirational
    were stylized*drawings* of horses—where other, more capable artists have already
    done the hard work of abstracting and amplifying the core equestrian features.
    A Google image search will provide you with plenty of reference material. After
    much sketching, undoing, and emphasizing (by adding pen pressure), I had the sketch
    shown in [Figure 23-2](#fig23-2).

- en: A traditional comic or cartoon artist's workflow has two main stages:*sketching*
    (typically with a pencil) and *inking* (with a pen) over the rough sketch. You
    can follow the same process in Inkscape. As soon as the drawing looks more or
    less like a horse, start inking *over* it, on a new layer, to develop it further.
    This way, you can amplify what is good in your sketch and build on that without
    the risk of destroying it with too much tweaking. Select all strokes (Ctrl-A)
    and assign them an opacity of 0.05 so they become barely visible; this effectively
    hides the thin strokes, making it easier to concentrate on the bold ones. Then,
    lock this layer (using the lock toggle button in the status bar), create a new
    one (**Layer ▶ Add Layer**), and draw the same horse *again* using the sketch
    as a guide, as shown in [Figure 23-3](#fig23-3).

    a real horse—perhaps a bit too real. What we want is a cartoon, not photorealism.
    In cartoons, creatures’ heads (especially the eyes) and feet (or hands or paws)
    are often enlarged, out of proportion. In the first inking layer, let''s do just
    that: keep the body the same but enlarge the hooves and the head, adding a pair
    of oversized cartoonish eyes ([Figure 23-4](#fig23-4)).'

    objects, which makes nudging, scaling, or rotating parts of a drawing easy. To
    make such adjustments on the horse drawing, with the Selector tool, drag around
    the leg or the head to select all its objects and use either the mouse handles
    or the convenient keyboard shortcuts: Alt-arrows to move, Alt-< or Alt-> to scale,
    or Alt-[ or Alt-] to rotate. Often, you’ll make a good stroke but at a wrong scale
    or in the wrong location—instead of deleting, transform it to fit. Even if it
    already looks acceptable, playing with a character’s limbs or facial features
    can sometimes make it more expressive than you thought possible ([Figure 23-5](#fig23-5)).'

    previous sketch layer, lock and fade out your current layer to make it a new sketch,
    and create a new inking layer on top. With every such transition, a drawing usually
    will look less and less like a pencil sketch and more like an ink drawing with
    smooth strokes and elaborate details. [Figure 23-6](#fig23-6) shows my third inking
    attempt over the previous sketch layers; making the head look like a horse rather
    than a hippopotamus was especially difficult.

    Inkscape can emulate many different coloring styles. For example, you can imitate
    a painting by overlaying many random calligraphic strokes and painting each one
    with a different color and opacity (using the Tweak tool, [8.9.1](c08.xhtml#section8.9.1)).

    gradients, [10.1.2](c10.xhtml#section10.1.2)). Use the Paint bucket tool ([14.3](c14.xhtml#section14.3))
    to create the interior shape; apply a little blur to it (about 2 percent) for
    extra smoothness ([Figure 23-7](#fig23-7)).'

    it smoother and more attractive if you select all the strokes in part of the figure
    (such as a leg or the head), union them (Ctrl-+), and press Ctrl-L a few times.
    Performing those steps melts the sharp corners and welds the joints for a much
    more natural and integrated look ([Figure 23-8](#fig23-8)). Another useful trick
    is to make all strokes thicker by pressing Alt-) to outset them and then pressing
    Alt-( to make them thinner ([12.4](c12.xhtml#section12.4)).

    Too much insetting may make some parts of a path disappear altogether, but this
    is not necessarily bad—trust the overall impression and your artistic sense.

- en: For many new artists, drawing realistic-looking hair is hard. Striking the right
    balance between regularity and chaos, as well as between tidiness and untidiness
    is critical for the impression your character will make. At this stage of the
    horse drawing, the tail and especially the mane weren't impressive. I drew them
    over and over, but all my attempts looked either too lumpy or too bushy (or both).
    I was finally able to produce a decent wavy hair by using a high value ofTremor
    ([14.2.4](c14.xhtml#section14.2.4)) in the Calligraphic pen ([Figure 23-9](#fig23-9)).
    Maximizing this parameter makes the calligraphic brush strokes nicely blotchy
    and much more uniformly uneven than I was able to do manually.

    which can sometimes cause significant improvements without needing to do much

    have been able to achieve this level of quality by drawing on paper. Of course,
    you can do other styles of drawing with Inkscape; experiment to find the techniques
    that are most natural for you. I have grown to especially like the Calligraphic
    pen with a high Tremor value, which provides an almost "natural media" drawing
    tool, as shown in [Figure 23-10](#fig23-10).

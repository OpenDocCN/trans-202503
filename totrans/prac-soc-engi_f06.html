<p class="ChapterIntro">Social engineering is a lethal attack vector. It is often used as a means of delivering malware or other payloads, but sometimes it is the endgame, such as in attacks designed to trick victims into handing over their banking information. The beautiful disaster that comes from social engineering is that, aside from phishing, it is <em>really</em> hard to detect. Whether you’re just breaking into the information security industry, a seasoned penetration tester, or on the defensive side, you will likely be exposed to social engineering sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Exploring the “why” before the “how” of social engineering can amplify your understanding, help you build better processes and detections, and enable you to identify the singular flaw in the logic of a process to succeed in your exploitation. The how will change over time, but the why is rooted in hundreds, if not thousands, of years of human DNA. </p>

<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Practical Social Engineering</em> is for anyone seeking to gain a better understanding of social engineering and what goes into successful attacks. This book is for you if you are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A newcomer to the information security industry</li>
<li>A seasoned penetration tester or red teamer</li>
<li>A member of a defensive or blue team</li>
<li>An executive or manager tasked with building detection or awareness programs for your organization</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h1-500983f06-0002">What You’ll Find in This Book</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">This book is designed to be consumed in three sections:</p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>The Basics</b></p>
<ol class="none">
<li>This is where we discuss the many activities that comprise social engineering and the psychological concepts at the root of the discipline. We also dedicate a chapter to social engineering’s ethical considerations. Unlike traditional penetration testing, which handles data and systems, social engineering penetration tests target people and thus require exceptional care.</li>
</ol>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Offensive Social Engineering</b></p>
<ol class="none">
<li>This is a discussion of how to perform social engineering. We begin with OSINT, its usefulness in social engineering attacks, and how to collect it using a number of professional tools. We then walk through a sophisticated phishing attack designed to steal users’ credentials, drawing attention to the many tricks used to fool users and defenders alike. We also cover how to measure the impact of your engagement and communicate its severity to your client.</li>
</ol>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Defending Against Social Engineering</b></p>
<ol class="none">
<li>This section adopts the defender’s perspective. We discuss numerous techniques to proactively protect your team from social engineering attacks, as well as strategies for quickly recovering when attacks do succeed. We also explore technical email controls and tools for analyzing potentially suspicious emails.</li>
</ol>
<p>One of these sections may be more relevant to you (and your current role or aspirations) than the others, but I encourage you to read the entire book to better grasp what to expect from the opposing side of the engagement as well. </p>
<h2 id="h1-500983f06-0003"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxi" title="xxi"/>Summary</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Practical Social Engineering</em> is not meant to be the end-all, be-all resource for learning about social engineering. After you’ve read this book, it can serve as an amplifying reference or complement to other material. You should continue to study psychology, sociology, and human-computer interaction, in addition to what malicious actors are using as their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), to remain current in social engineering. This field and the associated research are constantly evolving. </p>
<p>Now let’s get to the fun stuff!</p>

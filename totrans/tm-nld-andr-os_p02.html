<p class="BodyFirst">The Android platform was built, necessarily, from the bottom up.</p>
<p>Much like it is tricky to build the penthouse apartment in a skyscraper before having the foundation and fifty stories below it, it was difficult to build Android applications without having the underlying OS kernel, graphics system, framework, UI toolkit, APIs, and other fundamental layers that those applications would need. Because thereâ€™s nothing worse than walking into your new penthouse apartment and falling down all the way to street level.</p>

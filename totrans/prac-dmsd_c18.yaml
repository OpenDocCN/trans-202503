    it’s not urgent. In the short haul, we can typically make do just fine without
    electricity, gasoline, or natural gas. Shielding yourself from the occasional
    inconvenience caused by temporary outages or fuel crises is possible, but hatching
    elaborate plans of this nature usually doesn’t make much sense. It costs far more
    to keep the appliances humming along through a week-long power outage than it
    would to throw out the spoiled contents of the fridge once in a blue moon.

    an emergency, but in this day and age, it’s an unnecessary fire risk. Battery-powered
    flashlights are a much more practical choice; alkaline batteries cost as little
    as 20 cents apiece in bulk, can be stored for 5 to 10 years, and a pair of AAs
    can deliver 100 hours of illumination with ease. Without delicate lightbulbs to
    burn out or shatter, modern flashlights are also a lot more durable than the technologies

    don’t automatically mean a better purchase. In most situations, there’s no need
    for retina-searing beacons that light up the sky and chew through a crate of batteries
    a day. Indoors, as little as 10 to 20 lumens is enough for most household work.
    Outside, around 200 lumens is sufficient to scout the backyard or go on a night
    hike. Only the owners of larger rural properties may benefit from 1,000 lumens
    or more—and that’s only for investigating disturbances hundreds of yards away.

    the right choice. Carrying a flashlight ties up one of your hands and gets in
    the way of many household chores. For reading, dining, or cooking, omnidirectional
    lanterns that can be set on the table or on the counter are more convenient. Headlights
    are fantastic too, although they have the disadvantage of blinding whoever is
    standing right in front of you—so while they’re well liked by their users, they
    might not always win acclaim from other family members or friends.

    dark, cool, and dry place to maximize their shelf life. It’s preferable to keep
    alkaline cells out of any electronics that don’t need to be operational at a moment’s
    notice; this is because, no matter what the manufacturers promise, the batteries
    occasionally spring corrosive leaks of potassium hydroxide, damaging metal contacts
    and printed circuit boards in the device. If the equipment must be stored with
    batteries, it’s best to rely on somewhat more expensive but leak-proof lithium
    cells. These are available in a variety of specialized sizes, such as 18650 or
    CR123, but also as retrofits for alkaline AA, AAA, and 9V (look for the Energizer
    Ultimate brand). Another option is to inspect and replace installed batteries
    regularly, as the likelihood of leaks increases with age. In this model, tossing
    out old batteries after one year in the device is best.

    generators can provide around 5,000 to 6,000 watt-hours per gallon of gas. As
    with power stations, countless options are available on the market, but because
    a generator is a fairly complex and somewhat dangerous piece of equipment, it’s
    probably best to stick to reputable brands. Honda EU2200i and Yamaha EF2000iS

    In most situations, keeping around 10 to 15 gallons is the sensible maximum that’s
    unlikely to attract the wrath of authorities^([*](#c18-footnote-1)) or cause serious
    problems in the event of a leak. But even with this modest quantity, you should
    take care not to create undue fire risks. Gasoline vapors are heavy and can travel
    considerable distances, so the fuel needs to be stored in suitable containers,
    in a place with good airflow, and far from any sources of ignition—including water
    heaters, washers and dryers, and other appliances commonly found in or near the
    garage. Where possible, it’s best to investigate outdoor storage in a backyard
    shed or other detached structure; proper metal cans are preferable to cheap plastic
    jugs too.

    oxygen and moisture. This is why it’s important to follow the manufacturer’s instructions
    for draining a generator after every use (and why small gas-powered lawn tools,
    such as weed wackers, are notoriously unreliable when pulled out of storage after
    a couple of months).

    tends to stay good longer than urban legends dictate. To avoid problems caused
    by moisture, it’s best to use ethanol-free gas in states where this option is
    available at the pump. Oxidation can be limited with fuel stabilization preservatives
    such as STA-BIL or PRI-G. With these precautions taken, fuel can easily be stored
    for a year or more—although it’s still wise to rotate it every now and then, most
    simply by putting it in your car’s fuel tank. It’s best to do this when the tank
    isn’t completely empty; mixing it with fresh gas minimizes the chance of any hiccups
    on the road, however unlikely that may be.

    are out. If the temperature inside the house drops below freezing for a longer
    while, the water in the pipes may freeze and cause the piping to burst. A simple
    work-around is to leave the taps slightly open, allowing somewhat warmer water
    from the main to continuously flow through the pipes. Even if the liquid eventually
    freezes, the slow trickle may relieve some of the pressure and disrupt crystal
    formation. In single-family homes, it’s also possible to preemptively shut off
    the water and drain the system by opening a low-lying tap, although losing running
    water is seldom a good deal.

    more of a nuisance. To avoid trouble, some homeowners opt to add inhibited glycol
    to their hydronic systems or indirect water heaters. The glycol depresses the
    freezing temperature of the mix, making this a worthwhile endeavor in some settings,
    especially in regions where outdoor temperatures frequently drop below 10°F. Draining
    the system during prolonged outages may be a last-resort option too—although this
    takes the heating out of commission until refilled and properly purged of air.

    good to have alternative sources of heat. Some houses, especially in cold climates,
    may be equipped with two or more independent heat sources, such as a gas fireplace
    and electric baseboards. For homes without an adequate backup, inexpensive indoor-safe
    units, such as the propane-powered Mr. Heater, can bridge the gap. These heaters
    can be operated from disposable 1-pound camping cylinders—or, with the correct
    hose, from a standard 15- to 20-pound propane tank commonly used for backyard
    grills (although bringing such a cylinder indoors should be a measure of last
    resort). Of course, any portable heater needs to be used with the utmost care
    and kept well clear of flammable items. Adding a battery-powered carbon-monoxide
    detector is wise too.

    worry, but surprisingly, heat waves kill far more people than the cold. This is
    because in most situations, managing heat exhaustion is more difficult than staying
    warm. The warning signs of a heat stroke are also far less obvious. To avoid trouble
    on exceptionally hot days, hydration should be watched closely. As noted in Chapter
    15, as many as four to eight quarts of water a day may be needed to offset losses
    due to sweating, and we don’t always have a strong instinct to drink more. Eating
    much less than usual is beneficial too, as it tends to slow metabolism and gives
    our bodies more headroom to regulate body temperature.

    a surprising amount of energy to evaporate, and the process can cool surfaces

    of a storm. The efficiency of grills or campfires is much lower too, requiring
    that far more fuel be stored to achieve the same effect as a camping stove. In
    rural settings, firewood may be abundant, although it can be laborious to collect;

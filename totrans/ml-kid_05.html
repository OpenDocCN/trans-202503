</header>
<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="OpenerCap"><img src="Images/Alphabet-I.png" alt="Alphabet-I" class="dropcap"/></span>n this chapter, we’ll look at how computers can be trained to recognize different tones and emotion in written text, a technique known as <em>sentiment analysis</em><em/>.</p>
<p class="ChapterIntroContinued">Imagine you need to write a few sentences to say that you are going to the zoo tomorrow.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="84" id="Page_84"/>Think about what you might write if you’re super happy and excited about going. You love the zoo, and you can’t wait to go. What sorts of words would you use? Would your excitement affect the way you write the sentences?</p>
<p>Now think of what you might write if you’re angry about having to go. You hate zoos, there are other things that you’d rather be doing tomorrow, and you’re annoyed that someone is making you go. How might that show up in your writing? Would your annoyance make you use different sorts of words than you would if you were happy about going? Would you phrase your sentences differently?</p>
<p>Both of these paragraphs would have the same basic meaning (that you are going to the zoo tomorrow), but their tone and sentiment would be different. Computers can be trained to recognize the patterns in how we write when we’re annoyed compared with how we write when we’re happy. With enough examples of text demonstrating different emotions and sentiment, you can train an ML model to identify the emotion or tone in a new piece of writing based on patterns in vocabulary and grammar that the computer learns to recognize.</p>
<p>ML systems that are trained to recognize sentiment and emotion in text can be used to understand how people feel about things. For example, businesses use sentiment analysis to find out what people think about their products or services by pointing their ML model at millions of blogs, forums, newsgroups, and social media posts—far more than they could ever read themselves. Sentiment analysis tells them how much of that feedback seems positive and how much seems negative, and what the most common complaints and criticisms are.</p>
<p>Sentiment analysis isn’t just applied to massive amounts of text across the whole internet, though. Companies will often use it to help sort and prioritize customer support letters and emails, replying first to the letters and emails that sound the angriest or most annoyed. </p>
<p>Similarly, companies use sentiment analysis on their own internal discussions as a way of estimating how happy their employees are and if there are any issues or concerns that need attention. </p>
<p>In this chapter, you’ll train an ML model to recognize the sentiment expressed by two different types of text: compliments and insults.</p>
<h2 id="h1-500563c07-0001"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="85" id="Page_85"/>Build Your Project</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">In this project, you’ll create a character that reacts to a message you type (see <a id="figureanchor7-1" href="#figure7-1">Figure 7-1</a>). If you give the character a compliment, it will look happy. If you insult it, it will look sad.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">First, start by designing your character. For my screenshots, I drew a simple face. You can draw anything you like, as long as you can tell if it is happy or sad. You could make an animal, a robot, an alien, or anything else you can think of.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Let’s look at a few ways you could improve this project.</p>
<h3 id="h2-500563c07-0006">Using Speech Input Instead of Typing</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">What about changing your project so that you can say your compliments and insults aloud instead of typing them?</p>
<p>You’ll need a microphone on your computer to be able to use speech input, and you’ll need to add the Speech to Text extension from the Scratch Extensions Library. To access the Extensions Library, click the Add Extension icon (it looks like two blocks with a plus sign, +) at the bottom of the Toolbox. This library contains additional blocks you can use in your projects. </p>
<p>Find and click the <b>Speech to Text</b> extension to add those blocks to your Toolbox, and then update your script to look like <a id="figureanchor7-20" href="#figure7-20">Figure 7-20</a>. </p>
<aside epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="top hr"><hr/></div>
<section class="note">

<figcaption><p><a id="figure7-20" href="#figureanchor7-20">Figure 7-20:</a> The Make me happy project using speech recognition </p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><em>Speech recognition</em><em/> is another application of ML. For this improvement, you aren’t training the speech ML model yourself, you’re using a model that someone else has trained for you. But the basic principle behind how the speech blocks were created is similar to how you created the typed examples of compliments and insults.</p>
<p>What else could you do to improve your project?</p>
<h3 id="h2-500563c07-0007">Recognizing Speech That Isn’t a Compliment or Insult</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Type <code class="bold">What is the time?</code> to your character. It might think that this question is a compliment and look happy. Or it might identify it as an insult and look sad. </p>
<p>Neither of those reactions is really the right thing to do. You could update your code so that it doesn’t react at all when it gets messages that aren’t a compliment or an insult.</p>
<p>When you tested your ML model in the Learn &amp; Test phase, you may have noticed the confidence score showing how confident the computer is that it has recognized the message. </p>
<p>Try typing <code class="bold">What is the time?</code> again now, as shown in <a id="figureanchor7-21" href="#figure7-21">Figure 7-21</a>.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" title="98" id="Page_98"/><figure>
<img src="Images/f07021.png" alt="f07021"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure7-21" href="#figureanchor7-21">Figure 7-21:</a> Testing the confidence in classifying “What is the time?”</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You should see that this message gets a very low confidence score. This is the ML model’s way of telling you that it didn’t recognize the text. It’s saying that in all of the training examples you’ve given it, it hasn’t seen anything like that before, so it wasn’t able to recognize whether the message was a compliment or insult.</p>
<p>My ML model had a confidence score of 0 in its classifying of “What is the time?” Your ML model might have scored a bit higher, depending on how you trained it. For example, if you included a lot of questions like “What is wrong with you?” in your insults bucket, your ML model might have 10 percent confidence that “What is the time?” is an insult, just because it is a question. That would still be useful information, as it’s telling you that there’s a 90 percent chance that the message isn’t an insult. It’s saying that the message had some similarities to patterns that it recognizes from the insults it learned from, but that it isn’t able to <em>confidently</em> identify the message as an insult. </p>
<p>Experiment with different test sentences that aren’t compliments or insults to see what sort of confidence scores you get. Compare these with the confidence scores you get when you test your ML model on messages that really are compliments and insults. </p>
<p>What sort of confidence score does your ML model give when it correctly recognizes an actual compliment or insult?</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="99" id="Page_99"/>You can use the confidence score in your Scratch project, as shown in <a id="figureanchor7-22" href="#figure7-22">Figure 7-22</a>.</p>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure7-22" href="#figureanchor7-22">Figure 7-22:</a> Using confidence scores in your code </p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This script will make the character react only if the ML model is at least 70 percent confident that it has recognized the message you give it. Otherwise, the script will ignore the message.</p>
<p>You’ll need to change the <code>70</code> to a percentage that works for your ML model, based on your own testing.</p>
<p>Is there anything else you could do to improve your project?</p>
<h3 id="h2-500563c07-0008">Learning from Mistakes</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">When someone is using an ML system, they’ll often know if the computer has made a mistake. One way to improve your ML project is to let it learn from those mistakes.</p>
<p>Give the user a way to tell the project if the ML model makes a mistake. It could be a button to click, or a text box where they type “yes” or “no” in response to being asked, “Did I get that right?”</p>
<p>The script shown in <a id="figureanchor7-23" href="#figure7-23">Figure 7-23</a> will ask if the ML model is correct. If you type “no,” the text the computer didn’t recognize correctly will be added to the training examples. After every five new training examples, a new ML model is trained.</p>

<p>Training your model to learn from mistakes will make it smarter the longer you use it. Think of how you’d like to tell your character when it has misunderstood you, and use a script like this so it can learn from your feedback.</p>
<h2 id="h1-500563c07-0003">What You Learned</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">In this chapter, you learned about <em>sentiment analysis</em>, the use of ML to recognize the tone and emotion in text. You learned how businesses and organizations use sentiment analysis to get valuable insight and feedback from customers on the internet, prioritize customer service responses, and measure employee satisfaction.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="101" id="Page_101"/>You discovered that ML is a much better approach to building AI systems for complex projects than a simple rules-based method. You also learned how confidence scores can tell you how sure an ML model is of the predictions it’s making, and saw how you could improve your ML models by helping them learn from their mistakes.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, you’ll use an approach similar to sentiment analysis to train a model to recognize different styles of writing. </p>

- en: 'I first set foot in China in November 2006\. I had no idea what I was walking
    into. When I told my mother I was going to visit Shenzhen, she exclaimed, “Why
    are you going there? It’s just a fishing village!” She wasn’t wrong: Shenzhen
    was just a town of 300,000 back in 1980, but it had exploded into a megacity of
    10 million in less than 30 years. Between my first visit and the time I wrote
    this book, Shenzhen gained an estimated 4 million people—more than the population
    of Los Angeles.'

    growth. Before going to China, I had never mass-produced anything. I didn’t know
    anything about supply chains. I had no idea what “operations and logistics” meant.
    To me, it sounded like something out of a math or programming textbook.

    build a supply chain suitable for our hardware startup, Chumby. Sending a novice
    into China was a big risk, but my lack of preconceived notions was more of an
    asset than a liability. Back then, venture capitalists shunned hardware, and China
    was only for established companies looking to build hundreds of thousands of units
    of a given product. My first set of tours in China certainly supported that notion,
    as I primarily toured mega-factories serving the *Fortune* 500.

    startup customer. At PCH, I was mentored by some of the finest engineers and supply
    chain specialists. I was also fortunate to be allowed to share my experiences
    on my blog, as Chumby was one of the world’s first open hardware startups.

    partners was a constant struggle, I kept noticing small things that didn’t square
    with conventional wisdom. Somehow, local Chinese companies were able to remix
    technology into boutique products. The so-called shanzhai integrated cell phones
    into all kinds of whimsical forms, from cigarette lighters to ornamental golden
    Buddha statuettes (more on this in [Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04)). The niche nature
    of these products meant they had to be economical to produce in smaller volumes.
    I also noticed that somehow factories were able to rapidly produce bespoke adapter
    circuits and testing apparatuses of surprisingly high quality in single-unit volumes.
    I felt there was more to the ecosystem—a story that was being told over and over
    again—but few had the time to listen, and those who did heard only the parts they
    wanted to hear.

    was crushed, and factories that were once too busy printing money were now swimming
    in excess capacity. I made friends at several medium-sized factories in the area.
    I started to inquire about how, exactly, these factories were able to so nimbly
    produce their internal test equipment, and how shanzhai were able to prototype
    and build such bespoke phones.

- en: The bosses and engineers were initially reticent, not because they wanted to
    hide potential competitive advantages from me, but because they were ashamed of
    their practices. Foreign clients were full of corporate process, documentation,
    and quality procedures, but they also paid dearly for such overhead. Local companies
    were much more informal and pragmatic. So what if a bin is labeled “scrap”? If
    the bits inside are suitable for a job, then use them!

- en: I wanted in. As an engineer, tinkerer, and hacker, I cared a lot about the cost
    to produce a few units, and a couple of minor assembly defects was nothing compared
    to the design issues I had to debug. I eventually managed to coax a factory into
    letting me build a part using its low-quality but ultra-cheap assembly process.

- en: The trick was to guarantee that I would pay for all the product, including defective
    units. Most customers refuse to pay for imperfect goods, forcing the factory to
    eat the cost of any part that isn’t exactly to specification. Thus, factories
    strongly dissuade customers from using cheaper but low-quality processes.

- en: Of course, my promise to pay for defective product meant there was no incentive
    for the factory to do a good job. It could have, in theory, just handed me a box
    of scrap parts and I’d still have had to pay for it. But in reality, nobody had
    such ill intentions; as long as everyone simply tried their best, they got it
    right about 80 percent of the time. Since small-volume production costs are dominated
    by setup and assembly, my bottom line was still better despite throwing away 20
    percent of my parts, and I got parts in just a couple of days instead of a couple
    of weeks.

    everything. I’ve made it a point to discover more alternative production methods
    and continue shortening the path between ideas and products, with ever more options
    along the cost-schedule-quality spectrum.

    discovery. For example, every January, instead of going to the frenzied Consumer
    Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, I rented a cheap apartment in Shenzhen and
    engaged in the “monastic study of manufacturing”; for the price of one night in
    Las Vegas, I lived in Shenzhen for a month. I deliberately picked neighborhoods
    with no English speakers and forced myself to learn the language and customs to
    survive. (Although I’m ethnically Chinese, my parents prioritized accent-free
    fluency in English over learning Chinese.) I wandered the streets at night and
    observed the back alleys, trying to make sense of all the strange and wonderful
    things I saw going on during the daytime. Business continues in Shenzhen until
    the wee hours of the morning, but at a much slower pace. At night, I could make
    out lone agents acting out their interests and intentions.

    learn. The Pearl River Delta ecosystem is incomprehensibly vast. As with the Grand
    Canyon, simply hiking one trail from rim to base doesn’t mean you’ve seen it all.
    I have, however, picked up enough knowledge to build a custom laptop and to develop
    a new process for peel-and-stick electronic circuits.

    ecosystem over the years, via a remix of blog posts that I wrote along the way.
    Some of the essays are reflections on particular aspects of Chinese culture; others
    are case studies of specific manufacturing practices. I conclude with a chapter
    called “The Factory Floor,” a set of summary recommendations for anyone considering
    outsourced manufacturing. If you’re in a hurry, you can skip all the background
    and go directly there.

    out the shortcuts and hazards along the way; it’s even easier to forget all of
    the wrong turns and bad assumptions. There’s no one-size-fits-all method for approaching
    China, and my hope is that by reading these stories, you can come to your own
    (perhaps different) conclusions that better serve your unique needs.

    intended just for developers. Irina said, “The objective was to create excitement

    to Irina’s internal branding team and made a request. They said the name of the
    product was Android, and they wanted a compelling launch story. They suggested
    making it look human, and wanted something that would get developers excited.

- en: Note that the black logos seen in the sketch sheet are not “black” as much as
    they are colorless; black is just a neutral color she was using while she iterated
    on early shapes and ideas. You can see the A for Android incorporated into many
    of the ideas (though not the final one). You can also see that there is a black
    version of the final logo, in the center bottom of early designs. That’s close
    to where the design ended up (with the addition of two antennae), but Irina remembers
    it as one of her first ideas.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the important elements in the final design was the shape itself. “The
    logo was inspired by an international symbol. There is a very simple symbol of
    a human. I tried to come up with the equivalent symbol for Android.” Irina had
    worked with ideas of pictograms for other branding projects, which were powerful
    because of “how people see pictograms and signs and how they can communicate without
    words. They’re so simple and they communicate across all cultures.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Irina also strove for simplicity: “Since the logo was meant to be a blueprint,
    the shape itself couldn’t be too intricate.”'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Blueprint* refers to another aspect of the final design: it was released into
    open source and developers were encouraged to use it and to create variations
    on that theme: “It could be decorated differently. That’s what this logo system
    is.”'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a couple of elements about how the mascot was released that made her
    blueprint system work. One was that the bugdroid^([1](#c16-footnote-1)) is explicitly
    licensed for reuse, under a Creative Commons license. On the Android brand guidelines
    site, it says, “The green Android robot can be reproduced and/or modified as long
    as the following Creative Commons attribution line is included. . . .”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This license gives anyone the right to use and modify the robot. But if it
    were just a small JPEG file, it wouldn’t lead to very interesting variations.
    That’s where the second part of the strategy kicks in: The logo was released in
    multiple file formats that lend themselves to redesign. First of all, there is
    a high-resolution version in the PNG format with a transparent background. But
    if you really want to modify the image, you’ll want one of the other *vector*
    formats (EPS, SVG, and AI), which allow you to work directly with the robot’s
    geometry.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Making the robot freely usable was revolutionary. Irina spoke about more traditional
    approaches of branding: “Identity comes in brand guidelines, which is a really
    giant book with restrictions: ‘Here’s a clear space around the logo. Here are
    the colors. . . . ’ The logo is sacred. And this was just completely ripping that
    traditional notion apart.” This aspect of the logo came not from the Android team
    itself, but from Irina’s branding group, in response to Android being open sourced:
    “This was our creative idea to address that. Being a designer, your job is to
    communicate what the product stands for. That was a revolutionary creative idea
    at the time. This was not given to us as a constraint; this was our solution,
    which I think is the best thing about this logo.”'

- en: Once the robot was released into the wild, it began to grow outside of Google
    and Android. “The logo was released as a system and it started to take on a life
    of its own. It started to be dimensional. You could see statues. It was almost
    like giving birth to a child and then watching the child grow. It started taking
    the first step, and then started to talk. Once it moved on, I watched it grow
    from a distance.”

- en: 'Once the external community got ahold of the robot, it took on a life way outside
    of its original target audience of developers: “It was just a developer release.
    It was never meant to be a consumer-facing logo. It was a small project, focused
    on developers. But it became so popular that it just grew bigger and bigger and
    bigger and spread to being consumer-facing.”'

    “Sometimes you can’t really measure the impact of the brand. The brand gives a
    product personality. And it generates excitement. Because we’re all human, and
    it’s emotional, and it helps to tell the story, and relate to the brand. This
    also excites the developers to develop more stuff, and it also excites the consumer.

    White, Andy Rubin, and Steve Horowitz. After co-founding Android, Chris reached
    out to Jeff to see if he was interested in joining their startup (which was then
    focused on a camera OS). But Chris couldn’t promise that a future at Android would
    be as secure as Jeff’s Microsoft job, so Jeff stayed where he was. Then Google
    acquired Android in July of 2005 and Jeff joined the Android team that December.

    review between Andy Rubin, myself, and Sergey Brin. Brin was notorious about speed,
    and said, ‘Why do we need gradients? They take more processing power.’ I think
    he’d be happy to have big buttons on the screen, nothing exciting. I had come

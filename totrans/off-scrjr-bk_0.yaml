- en: This book’s history stretches back 50 years when, in the 1960s, Seymour Papert
    presented a bold new vision of how computers might enter the lives of children.
    At the time, computers still cost tens of thousands of dollars, if not more. The
    first personal computers would not become commercially available for another decade.
    But Seymour foresaw that computers would eventually become accessible for everyone,
    even children, and he lay the intellectual foundation for how computing could
    transform the ways children learn and play.

    information to children or pose questions to children, Seymour had a very different
    vision. He believed that children should be in control of computers, using them
    to experiment, explore, and express themselves. Seymour and his colleagues at
    MIT developed the programming language Logo specifically for children so that
    children could program their own pictures, stories, and games. In his 1980 book
    *Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas* , Seymour argued that children
    should program computers, not the other way around.'

    when we were graduate students at MIT, and we were deeply influenced by his ideas.
    Both of us have dedicated our careers to extending Seymour’s work, providing young
    people with opportunities for designing, creating, and inventing with new technologies.

    closely with the LEGO Group on the MINDSTORMS and WeDo robotics kits and cofounded
    the Computer Clubhouse Network of after-school learning centers for youth from
    low-income communities. More recently, the group developed the Scratch programming
    language and online community, which is used by millions of young people (ages
    8 and up) around the world.

    Department of Child Study and Human Development at Tufts University has focused
    on early childhood learning, developing technologies and activities for preschool,
    kindergarten, and early elementary students. The group developed the ideas and
    prototypes that led to the KIBO robot kit, which enables young children (ages
    4–7) to program robotic projects by putting together sequences of wooden blocks.
    With KIBO, children learn programming without screens or keyboards. In 2013 Marina
    co-founded KinderLab Robotics to make KIBO widely available. The ideas underlying
    Marina’s and the DevTech Research Group’s work are described in Marina’s books
    *Blocks to Robots: Learning with Technology in the Early Childhood Classroom*
    (Teachers College Press, 2007) and *Designing Digital Experiences for Positive
    Youth Development: From Playpen to Playground* (Oxford University Press, 2012).'

- en: In 2010, Marina suggested that our two groups work together to develop a programming
    language for young children, extending MIT’s work on Scratch and drawing on Tufts’
    experience with early childhood learning, and thus the idea for ScratchJr was
    born. We teamed up with Paula Bontá and Brian Silverman of the Playful Invention
    Company (PICO), who brought strong expertise in the design and development of
    programming languages for children (and who also had worked closely with Seymour
    Papert). ScratchJr has been a true team effort, with contributions by many people
    at Tufts, MIT, PICO, and elsewhere. We encourage you to look at the ScratchJr
    website ( *[http://www.scratchjr.org/](http://www.scratchjr.org/)* ) for a full
    list of contributors.

    parents, and teachers around the world, but we recognize that more and better
    support materials are needed to help people use ScratchJr to its full potential.
    We wrote this book to support the use of ScratchJr in both homes and schools.
    We hope that you find the book useful, and we look forward to hearing your feedback
    and suggestions.

- en: We’ve been thrilled by the response to ScratchJr from thousands of children,
    parents, and teachers around the world, but we recognize that more and better
    support materials are needed to help people use ScratchJr to its full potential.
    We wrote this book to support the use of ScratchJr in both homes and schools.
    We hope that you find the book useful, and we look forward to hearing your feedback
    and suggestions.

    saving money or shuffling assets around; it must also address risks to the supply
    side of personal wealth. Or, in plain English: no matter what we have in the bank,
    job security is important too.'

  zh: 一个全面的财务准备计划不仅仅应关注存钱或资产调配，它还必须解决个人财富供应方面的风险。或者用简单的话说：不管我们银行里有多少钱，工作安全同样重要。
- en: At first blush, this assertion may seem overly broad. Many of us imagine that
    if we can only accumulate enough wealth, we’ll be able to retire early and never
    worry again about holding a job. In reality, however, few people in their prime
    reach the point where they no longer need to work another day in their lives,
    almost no matter how affluent they are. Even most millionaires aren’t so lucky.
    Assuming all they dream of is the median income for a family with children in
    the United States, they would need to accumulate at least $3 million in a somewhat
    risky revenue-generating portfolio to be able to permanently hang up their hats.^([*](#c08-footnote-1))
    And that’s for a life that’s comfortable, but certainly not glamorous or carefree;
    if they wish to travel the world or indulge in expensive hobbies, they might need
    quite a bit more.

  zh: 起初，这种说法可能显得过于宽泛。我们许多人都认为，如果我们能积累足够的财富，就能够早早退休，永远不再为工作而烦恼。然而，现实情况是，即使是在黄金年龄阶段，很少有人能达到不再需要工作的一天，几乎不论他们多么富有。即使是大多数百万富翁，也未必这么幸运。假设他们梦想的只是美国一个有孩子的家庭的中位数收入，他们将需要至少积累300万美元，并投入一个有一定风险的创收投资组合，才能够永远挂起工作帽^([*](#c08-footnote-1))。而这只是一种舒适的生活方式，肯定不是奢华或无忧无虑的；如果他们希望环游世界或沉迷于昂贵的爱好，可能还需要更多。
- en: Those who still have to get up every morning and go to work would be well served
    to remember that in the era of rapid technological disruption, fewer and fewer
    professions guarantee employment for life. In the 1990s, opening a VHS rental
    place or a music store was a sound business plan, journalism was a revered and
    well-paying gig, and the photographic film industry was a behemoth that consumed
    about a third of the global silver supply.^([1](b02.xhtml#c08-endnote-1)) It’s
    probably safe to assume that the next couple of decades are going to bring seismic
    shifts to many of today’s cozy professions and industries.

  zh: 那些每天早晨还必须起床去工作的人应该记住，在快速技术变革的时代，越来越少的职业能保证终身就业。1990年代，开设VHS租赁店或音乐商店是一个稳妥的商业计划，新闻业是一个受人尊敬且薪水可观的职业，而摄影胶片行业是一个庞然大物，消耗了全球大约三分之一的银供应量^([1](b02.xhtml#c08-endnote-1))。可以合理地假设，未来几十年将会对许多今天看似安逸的职业和行业带来剧烈的变革。
- en: In some cases, workers can be left behind even if their profession is doing
    fine. In my own field, there’s no shortage of jobs for software developers or
    computer administrators (now more fashionably called *reliability engineers*),
    but few are available to those who don’t keep up with the latest programming languages
    and framework choices. The jobs to maintain or extend legacy systems written in
    archaic languages and running on long-obsolete machines can be extremely lucrative,
    but their supply is drying up year by year.

  zh: 在某些情况下，即使他们的行业表现良好，工人也可能被落下。在我自己的领域，软件开发人员或计算机管理员（现在更时髦地称为*可靠性工程师*）的工作机会并不缺乏，但对于那些未能跟上最新编程语言和框架选择的人来说，工作机会就很少了。负责维护或扩展用古老语言编写并运行在过时机器上的遗留系统的工作可能非常有利可图，但这些职位每年都在逐渐减少。
- en: 'Whatever the mechanism for the potential future decline in demand for your
    skills may be, the prescription for tackling this risk can be straightforward:
    to gradually develop secondary, marketable skills, even if they’re of no immediate
    relevance to your current job. Most simply, this might involve staying apprised
    of new developments in your field of expertise and dabbling in the trendy if imperfect
    next-generation tech. Old-timers have a natural tendency to be suspicious of newfangled
    inventions and all the half-baked attempts to revolutionize their industries,
    but when trying to broaden our horizons, it’s good to remember that technologies
    can succeed even if they’re inferior to the old ways of doing business, and even
    if they’re *clearly* derivative of what’s already been discussed in the privately
    circulated memoir of the Slovenian Philological Society in 1883.'

  zh: 无论是什么机制可能导致你技能需求未来下降，解决这一风险的方案可以很简单：逐渐培养第二职业技能，即使这些技能与你当前的工作没有直接关系。最简单的做法可能是保持对你专业领域新发展的关注，涉足一些时髦但不完美的下一代技术。老一辈的人往往天生对新发明持怀疑态度，并且对各种半成品的行业革命尝试不屑一顾，但当我们试图拓宽视野时，值得记住的是，技术即便不如旧有方式成功，甚至*明显*源自1883年斯洛文尼亚语言学会私下流传的回忆录中已经讨论过的内容，也可能会成功。
- en: 'Bootstrapping a brand-new career can also be done safely and gradually. Picking
    up a sensible hobby is a great way to hone new skills without taking undue risks.
    Of course, hobbies can be counterproductive money sinks. I had far too many of
    these, and to weed out the dead ends, I eventually developed a simple test: I
    would look back at my projects from a year, two years, or five years ago. Feeling
    embarrassed and wanting to immediately redo it all would earn the hobby a passing
    grade; not seeing anything to improve or not knowing how to tackle the flaws would
    be a sign of a stagnant pursuit.'

  zh: 从零开始建立一份全新的职业也可以安全而渐进地进行。选择一个合理的爱好是磨练新技能的好方法，而不会承担过多风险。当然，爱好也可能成为无效的资金陷阱。我曾有过太多这样的经历，为了淘汰无效的方向，我最终制定了一个简单的测试：回顾自己一年前、两年前或五年前的项目。如果我感到尴尬并且想立即重新做一遍，那这个爱好可以通过；如果我看不到任何可以改进的地方，或者不知道如何解决存在的问题，那就意味着这是一个停滞不前的追求。
- en: 'As for selecting the right hobby, no list of options is objectively better
    than the rest. The possibilities are vast, and the right choice will inevitably
    depend on your own interests and talents, the space you have available, and countless
    other constraints. Many good, grounded choices with immediately marketable results
    can be found in the “arts and crafts” category: woodworking, metalworking (including
    jewelry and knife making), glassblowing, sewing, pottery, and so forth. Scientifically
    tinged pursuits can be gratifying too and can open doors to interesting job opportunities
    if you publish your work. Examples include amateur electronics, robotics, and
    recreational software engineering, to name a few. Creative occupations, such as
    writing and producing online videos, can quickly supplement income if you find
    your groove. Hunting for bargain collectibles at garage sales or on Facebook Marketplace
    can be exhilarating—and pay off handsomely if you develop an eye for the right
    stuff. Finally, charitable activities, including community education, can offer
    solid returns in less tangible ways: building meaningful relationships with people
    who might be looking for dependable employees or business partners down the line.'

  zh: 关于选择合适的爱好，没有任何一个选项列表能客观地优于其他。可能性非常广泛，正确的选择无疑取决于你自身的兴趣和才能、可用的空间，以及无数其他限制因素。在“艺术与手工艺”类别中，可以找到许多有市场前景的扎实选择：木工、金属加工（包括珠宝和刀具制作）、吹玻璃、缝纫、陶艺等。科学相关的爱好也能带来满足感，并且如果你发布作品，还能为你打开有趣的工作机会。举例来说，包括业余电子学、机器人技术和休闲软件工程等。创意工作，如写作和制作在线视频，如果你找到了自己的节奏，也能迅速补充收入。在跳蚤市场或Facebook
    Marketplace上寻找便宜的收藏品可以令人兴奋——如果你培养出敏锐的眼光，甚至能获得丰厚的回报。最后，慈善活动，包括社区教育，可以在不那么直接的方式上带来实际回报：与那些可能在未来寻找可靠员工或商业伙伴的人建立有意义的关系。

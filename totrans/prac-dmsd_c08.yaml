    saving money or shuffling assets around; it must also address risks to the supply
    side of personal wealth. Or, in plain English: no matter what we have in the bank,
    job security is important too.'

- en: At first blush, this assertion may seem overly broad. Many of us imagine that
    if we can only accumulate enough wealth, we’ll be able to retire early and never
    worry again about holding a job. In reality, however, few people in their prime
    reach the point where they no longer need to work another day in their lives,
    almost no matter how affluent they are. Even most millionaires aren’t so lucky.
    Assuming all they dream of is the median income for a family with children in
    the United States, they would need to accumulate at least $3 million in a somewhat
    risky revenue-generating portfolio to be able to permanently hang up their hats.^([*](#c08-footnote-1))
    And that’s for a life that’s comfortable, but certainly not glamorous or carefree;
    if they wish to travel the world or indulge in expensive hobbies, they might need
    quite a bit more.

    to remember that in the era of rapid technological disruption, fewer and fewer
    professions guarantee employment for life. In the 1990s, opening a VHS rental
    place or a music store was a sound business plan, journalism was a revered and
    well-paying gig, and the photographic film industry was a behemoth that consumed
    about a third of the global silver supply.^([1](b02.xhtml#c08-endnote-1)) It’s
    probably safe to assume that the next couple of decades are going to bring seismic
    shifts to many of today’s cozy professions and industries.

    fine. In my own field, there’s no shortage of jobs for software developers or
    computer administrators (now more fashionably called *reliability engineers*),
    but few are available to those who don’t keep up with the latest programming languages
    and framework choices. The jobs to maintain or extend legacy systems written in
    archaic languages and running on long-obsolete machines can be extremely lucrative,
    but their supply is drying up year by year.

    skills may be, the prescription for tackling this risk can be straightforward:
    to gradually develop secondary, marketable skills, even if they’re of no immediate
    relevance to your current job. Most simply, this might involve staying apprised
    of new developments in your field of expertise and dabbling in the trendy if imperfect
    next-generation tech. Old-timers have a natural tendency to be suspicious of newfangled
    inventions and all the half-baked attempts to revolutionize their industries,
    but when trying to broaden our horizons, it’s good to remember that technologies
    can succeed even if they’re inferior to the old ways of doing business, and even
    if they’re *clearly* derivative of what’s already been discussed in the privately
    circulated memoir of the Slovenian Philological Society in 1883.'

    up a sensible hobby is a great way to hone new skills without taking undue risks.
    Of course, hobbies can be counterproductive money sinks. I had far too many of
    these, and to weed out the dead ends, I eventually developed a simple test: I
    would look back at my projects from a year, two years, or five years ago. Feeling
    embarrassed and wanting to immediately redo it all would earn the hobby a passing
    grade; not seeing anything to improve or not knowing how to tackle the flaws would
    be a sign of a stagnant pursuit.'

    than the rest. The possibilities are vast, and the right choice will inevitably
    depend on your own interests and talents, the space you have available, and countless
    other constraints. Many good, grounded choices with immediately marketable results
    can be found in the “arts and crafts” category: woodworking, metalworking (including
    jewelry and knife making), glassblowing, sewing, pottery, and so forth. Scientifically
    tinged pursuits can be gratifying too and can open doors to interesting job opportunities
    if you publish your work. Examples include amateur electronics, robotics, and
    recreational software engineering, to name a few. Creative occupations, such as
    writing and producing online videos, can quickly supplement income if you find
    your groove. Hunting for bargain collectibles at garage sales or on Facebook Marketplace
    can be exhilarating—and pay off handsomely if you develop an eye for the right
    stuff. Finally, charitable activities, including community education, can offer
    solid returns in less tangible ways: building meaningful relationships with people
    who might be looking for dependable employees or business partners down the line.'

    a plunge to bootstrap a dream business with saved money, or get vocational training
    and certifications to learn a new profession and build up a résumé. It’s a gutsier
    move, but it can work well. In such a case, you still have options if the pursuit
    doesn’t pan out: your old profession becomes the backup plan.'

- en: I vividly remember the first time I “wrote” JavaScript. I’d been messing around
    with web design and copy-pasted some code from another website to add some weird
    effects whenever the mouse hovered over certain parts of the page. I had no idea
    what the code was doing, but through trial and error I managed to get something
    working.

    it a very gentle introduction to programming for me and countless others. So many
    people have chosen JavaScript as a first programming language because of how easy
    it is to get started: it’s right there waiting for you in your web browser!'

    possible, teaching all the essentials without getting bogged down in the intricacies
    of the language. I don’t expect you to have any prior programming experience.
    If you’re comfortable using a computer for everyday tasks like browsing the internet
    and editing documents, you have everything you need to get started.

    learn JavaScript independently through hands-on examples and projects. Maybe you
    want to transition into a career in computer programming, or you want to pursue
    coding as a hobby. Perhaps you’ve worked in other programming languages, and you
    need to get up to speed in JavaScript. If you’re a teacher and are looking for
    an easy way to introduce your students to programming, *JavaScript Crash Course*
    is a great option for you, too.'

- en: There are hundreds of programming languages to choose from, but there are a
    few things that make JavaScript special. Most important is its relationship with
    web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox. Almost
    every web browser can run JavaScript, which means the code you write in JavaScript
    can be run on any computer with a web browser. There’s no need to install any
    additional special software. Almost all smartphone web browsers can run JavaScript,
    too, so you may have a JavaScript-enabled browser in your pocket or bag right
    now.

- en: Because of its relationship to web browsers, JavaScript is an extremely important
    part of web development. If a website includes dynamic, interactive features,
    it was probably created with JavaScript. For example, YouTube uses JavaScript
    to show you previews of videos when you hover over their thumbnails, Threads uses
    JavaScript to load more posts as you scroll down the page, and Amazon uses JavaScript
    to power its Look Inside feature.

- en: Beyond its use in web browsers, JavaScript is also heavily used on the *backend*
    of websites, or the part of the website code that runs on a server, delivering
    content to users (as opposed to the *frontend* code that runs directly on the
    user’s device). This is possible via a technology called Node.js. Many top websites
    have a Node.js backend, letting you use the same language for the frontend and
    backend of your website, and even share code between the two.

- en: Finally, JavaScript has become a very popular scripting language for various
    applications, from Photoshop (where you can automate image processing) to Gmail
    (where you can add automations that organize your email). With some JavaScript
    knowledge, you can bend these applications to your will!

- en: While the language is useful in all these areas, this book will focus solely
    on browser-based JavaScript. There are a few reasons for this. First, as I’ve
    already mentioned, one of the great advantages of running JavaScript in a browser
    is that you don’t have to install anything special to get started. I didn’t want
    to begin the book with a tedious chapter on installing Node.js on your computer—a
    chapter that could become outdated as soon as it was written. Second, while virtually
    all websites use JavaScript for the frontend, JavaScript is just one among many
    possible languages for writing backend code. The browser is by far the most universally
    applicable context for learning JavaScript.

    after you finish this book and have some experience with the language. You should
    see the book as a jumping-off point: the beginning, rather than the end, of your
    JavaScript education. For more on next steps once you’ve worked through the book,
    see the afterword.'

    language itself, you’ll also learn skills that will help you in *any* programming

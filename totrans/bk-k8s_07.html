<h1 class="h1a"><strong>CONTAINERS IN KUBERNETES</strong></h1>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Computers have finite processing, storage, and memory, and are built of parts that fail, especially at the wrong time. To build a scalable, reliable application, we can’t be limited by the resources of a single host or dependent on a single point of failure. At the same time, we don’t want to give up the modularity and flexibility that containers provide. In <a href="part02.xhtml#part02">Part II</a>, we’ll see how Kubernetes meets the essential requirements to run containers across a cluster of machines, with cross-host container networking, scalability, automated failover, and distributed storage.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_86"/></p>&#13;

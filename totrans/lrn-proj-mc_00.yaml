- en: Welcome to *Learn to Program with Minecraft*! In this book, you’ll learn how
    to write programs with a programming language called Python to control what happens
    in your Minecraft world. You’ll learn how programming works, and then use what
    you learn to create buildings with code, write mini-games, and transform boring
    Minecraft items into exciting new toys. By the end of the book, you should have
    the skills you need to bring all of your wildest ideas to life.

    you learn in this book, you’ll be able to make all kinds of things (like games,
    apps, and useful tools) beyond programs that use Minecraft. This is the first
    step in your journey to becoming an amazing programmer and a Minecraft master!

- en: One of the main reasons to learn to program is that it teaches you how to solve
    problems. You’ll discover how to break down big problems into smaller parts to
    make them easier to tackle. Many of the problems you try to solve will require
    you to think in creative ways and test different ideas.

    better understand and plan the structure and flow of your programs. Even when
    you’re not working with computer code, problem solving, creativity, and thinking
    logically are valuable skills to have.

    with creative solutions to problems. Even if you don’t choose to become a programmer,
    programming as a hobby is engaging and entertaining. In fact, I started programming
    as a hobby and it led to a full-time job.

- en: So, why should you learn to program with Python? Python is a great first language
    for any beginning programmer. It’s easy to read and write, and it’s powerful enough
    to create real computer programs. Python is one of the most popular programming
    languages in the world!

    you have total freedom over what you create. You can let your imagination run
    free. By integrating Minecraft with your own Python programs, you can take even
    more control of Minecraft and unlock even more of your creativity. You’ll be able
    to do things (like constructing a huge building in just seconds) that are not
    possible with Minecraft alone.

    of code that doesn’t do anything exciting. But by combining Python and Minecraft,
    you’ll be able to see the results of your awesome programs instantly in your Minecraft
    world.

    book, you’ll build on your knowledge of Python programming. Included in each chapter
    are explanations of how Python works, examples that show Python in action, and
    Minecraft missions. In the missions, you’ll write programs that interact with
    Minecraft. I’ll provide you with some skeleton code, and it will be up to you
    to fill in the gaps and complete the programs. As a result, you’ll develop the
    problem-solving skills that are essential for any programmer.

    to instantly teleport your player by manipulating variables. You’ll learn about
    variables and how they remember data in your programs. You’ll even build on your
    fancy teleportation skills to go on a magical teleportation tour of your world.'

    shows you how to use math to grant yourself superpowers and build your creations
    at superfast speeds. Do you want to build a Minecraft house in less than a second?
    Math operators can help you do that. Do you want to jump super high in the air?
    Math operators have your back!'

    about strings to make an interactive chat. In programming, a *string* means text.
    You’ll learn how to write Minecraft Python programs that deliver messages to you
    and your players.'

    teaches you how to use Booleans and logic so your programs can answer questions.
    In other words, you’ll be able to make your programs tell you whether something
    is true or false. Your Minecraft Python programs can answer all kinds of questions:
    Am I underwater? Am I in a tree? Am I near my house?'

    Boolean logic to the next level. Using `if` statements, you’ll learn how to create
    programs that make decisions based on the data they’re given. Have you ever wanted
    a secret passage to open in Minecraft when you put a certain block in a certain
    place? You can do that using `if` statements!'

    shows you a very cool way to make your programs repeat using loops. You’ll be
    able to automate code to make amazing things happen. For example, imagine a trail
    of flowers following the player or a magical dance floor that flashes different
    colors. These are some of my favorite programs to show off to people.'

    you’ll learn to make mini-games with lists. Lists are a powerful programming concept
    because they let you store important information in one place. You’ll use lists
    to make your program remember all the blocks you hit with your sword, and with
    a few extra lines of code, you’ll turn that into a mini-game. Pretty neat!'

    and then load them into different game worlds. In other words, you’ll convert
    your buildings into files that you can transfer anywhere. Do you want to save
    that incredible mansion you built? No problem! With files, you’ll be able to save
    it and load it wherever you go.'

    finished this chapter, you’ll be a Python master. In the missions, you’ll start
    with some code that builds a building. Then you’ll use classes, objects, and inheritance
    to easily build duplicates and variations, like villages and hotels, with only
    a couple extra lines of code.'

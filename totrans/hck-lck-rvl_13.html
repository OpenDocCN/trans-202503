<p class="COS">The BlueLeaks dataset is full of an overwhelming number of documents, but it’s not immediately obvious where to start or how to make sense of the data they contain. Before beginning an investigation, I needed a way to efficiently determine the significance of these documents. After manually digging through many files, I discovered that the context I needed was in the hundreds of CSV spreadsheets in each BlueLeaks folder. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to investigate CSV files like these yourself.</p>

<p class="TX">You’ll view CSVs in both graphical spreadsheet and text editing software, write Python code to loop through the rows of a CSV, and save CSVs of your own. You’ll then put this knowledge into practice by digging through the CSVs in the BlueLeaks dataset, focusing on data from the NCRIC fusion center. This is the data I myself have primarily focused on <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_238" aria-label=" Page 238. "/>since BlueLeaks was published years ago, but there are over a hundred other folders in the dataset full of newsworthy revelations. By the end of this chapter, you’ll have the tools to continue investigating these folders, as well as similar datasets loaded with CSVs.</p>

<h3 class="H1" id="sec1"><span id="h-215"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Installing Spreadsheet Software</samp></h3>

<p class="TNI">The most user-friendly way to view the contents of a CSV file is to open it using spreadsheet software such as LibreOffice Calc, Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers, or Google Sheets. Spreadsheet software is a great option to see the data you’re dealing with in an organized way, and it can also be a powerful tool to analyze CSVs. However, in many cases, depending on the data you’re working with, you’ll need to go beyond such software and write custom code to work with CSVs.</p>

<p class="TX">If you already have a favorite spreadsheet program, you can use that for the projects in this book. If not, I suggest using LibreOffice Calc since it’s free, open source, and available for Windows, macOS, and Linux; it’s also what I’ve used for the examples in this chapter. Installing LibreOffice (<a href="https://www.libreoffice.org"><i>https://<wbr/>www<wbr/>.libreoffice<wbr/>.org</i></a>) installs a whole suite of office software, including Calc.</p>

<p class="TX">Alternatively, Microsoft Excel is a good option, but it costs money and isn’t available for Linux. If you have a Mac, you can also use Apple’s free spreadsheet software, Numbers. Finally, you can consider using Google Sheets, the spreadsheet feature of Google Docs. Google Docs is free and works in Windows, macOS, and Linux, since it’s web-based. The problem with Google Sheets and any other cloud-based spreadsheet software (like the web-based version of Microsoft Excel) is that you have to upload a copy of your CSV file to a third-party service before you can view it. For public datasets like BlueLeaks, this is okay. However, it’s better to use desktop spreadsheet software when you’re dealing with more sensitive datasets.</p>

<p class="TX">Spreadsheet software, when used with more complicated spreadsheet formats such as Microsoft Excel files (<i>.xlsx</i>) or ODF Spreadsheet files (<i>.ods</i>), is powerful and feature-rich. It can do math, like summing all of the values in a column, and visualize data, like creating pie charts or line graphs. None of these features are supported in CSV files, though, so I won’t discuss them in this book.</p>

<p class="TX">Once you have your spreadsheet software installed, you’re ready to learn more about the structure of CSV files.</p>

<h3 class="H1" id="sec2"><span id="h-216"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Introducing the CSV File Format</samp></h3>

<p class="TNI">You can think of spreadsheets as tables of data. The top row normally has headers for each column, and the rest of the rows represent data that matches those headers. CSV is the simplest spreadsheet format. You can open CSV files using software like Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc, or you can view them in a text editor and use CLI tools like <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">grep</samp> to search them.</p>

<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_239" aria-label=" Page 239. "/>BlueLeaks is full of CSV files, but the original data from the fusion center websites wasn’t in that format. The BlueLeaks dataset includes source code for those websites, and by reviewing that, I discovered that each site had actually stored its data in a Microsoft Access database file. The BlueLeaks hacker exported tables from the Access databases and saved that data in CSV format before leaking it to DDoSecrets.</p>

<p class="TX">CSV files are simply text files made up of multiple lines representing rows in a table. Each line contains a list of values, usually separated by commas (hence the name <i>comma-separated values</i>), with each value representing a <i>cell</i> in the spreadsheet. Sometimes a spreadsheet row is referred to as a <i>record</i>, with each cell in that row referred to as a <i>field</i> in that record. Typically, each row contains the same number of cells.</p>

<p class="TX">Here’s an example CSV file called <i>city-populations.csv</i>:</p>

<pre id="pre-380"><code>City,Country,Population

Tōkyō,Japan,37400000

Delhi,India,28514000

Shanghai,China,25582000

São Paulo,Brazil,21650000

Mexico City,Mexico,21581000

Cairo,Egypt,20076000</code></pre>

<p class="TX">You can find a copy of this file in the book’s GitHub repository at <a href="https://github.com/micahflee/hacks-leaks-and-revelations/blob/main/chapter-9/city-populations.csv"><i>https://<wbr/>github<wbr/>.com<wbr/>/micahflee<wbr/>/hacks<wbr/>-leaks<wbr/>-and<wbr/>-revelations<wbr/>/blob<wbr/>/main<wbr/>/chapter<wbr/>-9<wbr/>/city<wbr/>-populations<wbr/>.csv</i></a>. I’ll use this file as an example CSV later in this chapter, so download it now (or re-enter it) and save it in a folder for this chapter’s exercises.</p>

<p class="TX">It’s common to enclose every value in quotes, regardless of whether it includes commas. Here’s another version of the previous spreadsheet, now with every value in quotes:</p>

<pre id="pre-382"><code>"Language","Greeting"

"English","Hello, World"

"Español","Hola, Mundo"</code></pre>

<p class="TX">As with shell scripting and Python programming, you can escape quotes in CSVs by using a backslash and double quotes (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">\"</samp>). For example, the value <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">"Not I," said the cow</samp> contains both quotes and commas, so to add it to a CSV file you would surround the entire value in quotes and escape the inner quotes, like this:</p>

<pre id="pre-383"><code>"\"Not I,\" said the cow"</code></pre>

<p class="TX">Because the CSV file format is so simple, it’s one of the most commonly used spreadsheet formats, especially for anyone working with spreadsheets using code. Like CSVs, SQL databases also store <i>tabular data</i> (data that can be represented in a table), so CSVs are a convenient format for exporting tables from them. In fact, all of the CSVs in BlueLeaks are exported SQL tables from the databases that power law enforcement and fusion center websites. (You’ll learn about SQL databases in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a></span>; for now, you’ll work with the exported CSVs.)</p>

<p class="TX">Now that you understand a bit about the CSV file format, let’s take a look at some real CSV data from BlueLeaks.</p>

</section>

<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec3">

<h3 class="H1" id="sec3"><span id="h-217"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Exploring CSV Files with Spreadsheet Software and Text Editors</samp></h3>

<p class="TNI">In your graphical file browser (such as Explorer in Windows or Finder in macOS), browse to the <i>BlueLeaks-extracted</i> folder on your USB disk. You’ll start by examining the <i>dediac</i> subfolder, which contains data from the Delaware Information Analysis Center. Scroll through the files in this folder—nearly all of them are CSVs—and open <i>Documents.csv</i> in your graphical spreadsheet software.</p>

<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_241" aria-label=" Page 241. "/>When you open a file in LibreOffice Calc or other spreadsheet software, you’ll likely be presented with a window asking you to confirm the settings for this CSV. <a href="#fig9-1">Figure 9-1</a> shows the window that pops up when I open <i>Documents.csv</i> in LibreOffice Calc on my Mac.</p>
<figure class="IMG"><img class="img80" id="fig9-1" src="Images/Figure9-1.png" alt="A screenshot of the LibreOffice Calc “Text Import” dialog after opening Documents.csv. This dialog allows you to choose the separator character, which in this case is a comma." width="526" height="611"/>

<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 9-1: The LibreOffice Calc Text Import settings</samp></p></figcaption>

</figure>

<p class="TX">The most important setting to select is the correct separator character, which is, in this and most cases, a comma (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">,</samp>). Some CSVs separate values with characters other than commas, like semicolons (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">;</samp>) or tabs (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">\t</samp>), though this is rare. In the future if you aren’t sure which character your CSV uses, you can open the CSV in a text editor first to check.</p>

<p class="TX">Click <b>OK</b> to open the spreadsheet. This one should open quickly, but sometimes CSVs are huge—hundreds of mega- or gigabytes—so you may need to wait several seconds, or even minutes, for a large CSV to finish loading.</p>

<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_242" aria-label=" Page 242. "/><a href="#fig9-2">Figure 9-2</a> shows part of the <i>Documents.csv</i> spreadsheet in LibreOffice Calc.</p>
<figure class="IMG"><img class="img100" id="fig9-2" src="Images/Figure9-2.png" alt="A screenshot of Documents.csv opened in LibreOffice. The column headers include DocumentID, DocFilename, and DocTitle. This is a list of documents hosted by the fusion center." width="845" height="279"/>

</figure>

<p class="TX">This spreadsheet has 23 columns and 6,934 rows (one of which is the header row). At the top of the file, the dates in the DateEntered column are from 2011. You can find the most recent data in a spreadsheet by <i>sorting</i> it, either in ascending (from smaller to bigger) or descending (bigger to smaller) order. I’ll show you how to sort this spreadsheet in LibreOffice Calc, but the instructions should be similar for other spreadsheet software and apply to any spreadsheet you want to sort.</p>

<p class="TX">First, since you don’t want to sort the header row, click <b>View</b><span class="MenuArrow">▸</span><b>Freeze Cells</b><span class="MenuArrow">▸</span><b>Freeze First Row</b>. This should freeze the header row, so now when you scroll up and down, the headers will remain at the top of the file.</p>

<p class="TX">Next, you need to pick which column you want to sort by. To see the most recent documents at the top, sort by DateEntered descending. Before sorting this column, you must tell the spreadsheet software that those fields are dates with times and specify how they’re formatted (otherwise, the software might assume they’re strings and sort them alphabetically). Click column D to select all of the cells in that column and then click <b>Data</b><span class="MenuArrow">▸</span><b>Text to Columns</b>. This pops up a window that lets you define what type of data is in each column. At the bottom of the window, click the DateEntered column and choose <b>Date (MDY)</b> from the Column Type drop-down, because the dates in this data are formatted with month, then date, then year. Click <b>OK</b>.</p>

<p class="TX">Now that the spreadsheet software knows the correct format for the DateEntered cells, you can sort it by this column. Click the DateEntered header cell to select it (make sure not to select the whole column, just the header cell) and then click <b>Data</b><span class="MenuArrow">▸</span><b>Sort Descending</b>. This should reorder all of the rows so that the row with the most recent DateEntered is at the top and the one with oldest is at the bottom. In <i>Documents.csv</i>, the most recent documents are from June 6, 2020, during the Black Lives Matter protests. Some of the most recent document titles include “Special Bulletin Planned Protests 060620 1800 UPDATE,” “ANTIFA Sub Groups and Indicators – LES,” and “ANTIFA - Fighting in the Streets.”</p>

<p class="TX">I often use graphical spreadsheet programs to search CSVs. In LibreOffice, as well as in other spreadsheet programs, you can find specific cells using <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_243" aria-label=" Page 243. "/>the Find feature. Press <small>CTRL</small>-F (or, in macOS, <span class="code_symbol-alt"><?ACE 1a???></span>-F), enter your search term, and press <small>ENTER</small>. This should search every cell in the spreadsheet for your term. You can use this method to find a row containing, for example, a specific ID number or email address.</p>

<p class="TX">When you close the spreadsheet, don’t save your changes. It’s good practice to avoid changing original documents in a dataset. If you want to keep a record of your changes, save the file as a copy in either the ODF Spreadsheet (<i>.ods</i>) or Excel (<i>.xlsx</i>) format.</p>

<p class="TX">Now let’s look at the same CSV in a text editor instead of spreadsheet software. Here are the first few lines of the <i>Documents.csv</i> file, as viewed in a text editor like VS Code:</p>

<p class="TX">Because text editors show you only the text when you view a CSV file, without lining up the columns like spreadsheet software does, it’s less clear which value matches to which header for each row. There’s no simple way to manipulate the data, either—you can’t sort it by DateEntered like you can in LibreOffice Calc or Microsoft Excel. However, it’s simple to write code that loads the data from CSVs into dictionaries, allowing you to manipulate it in any way you choose, as you’ll do later in this chapter.</p>

<p class="TX">Now that you’re familiar with the structure of CSVs, you’re ready to see how I began my investigation into the BlueLeaks dataset.</p>

</section>

<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec4">

<h3 class="H1" id="sec4"><span id="h-218"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">My BlueLeaks Investigation</samp></h3>

<p class="TNI">I didn’t even realize that my local police intelligence agency, the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center (NCRIC, pronounced “nick-rick”), existed until I discovered it in the BlueLeaks dataset in June 2020. In this section I describe how I went about my investigation into BlueLeaks, what I discovered in the NCRIC portion of the dataset, and a specific revelation I found in one of the NCRIC CSV files.</p>

<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec5">

<h4 class="H2" id="sec5"><span id="h-219"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Focusing on a Fusion Center</samp></h4>

<p class="TNI">After downloading BlueLeaks, I indexed it in The Intercept’s Intella server to make it easier to search. This allowed me and journalists I worked with to quickly search it for keywords and find interesting documents. However, I could tell that searching for keywords would only get me so far. There <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_244" aria-label=" Page 244. "/>was so much data that if I only searched terms like <i>Black Lives Matter</i>, I was bound to miss a lot of it. Moreover, the searches I did make often led me to CSVs, which would take more work to untangle.</p>

<p class="TX">BlueLeaks was split into hundreds of folders, each one belonging to a different law enforcement organization. Since almost all of these organizations were unfamiliar to me, though, I couldn’t tell from the names which folder belonged to which organization. I started my own spreadsheet to keep track of this, manually adding rows for each folder as I matched organizations and their websites to it. Eventually, I realized that I could automate this with a Python script.</p>

<p class="TX">I also used shell scripting to figure out which folders had the most data, because I guessed they were the largest or most active fusion centers. I quickly discovered that the <i>ncric</i> folder, one of the largest in the dataset, held documents for NCRIC, so that’s where I decided to focus my digging.</p>

</section>

<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec6">

<h4 class="H2" id="sec6"><span id="h-220"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Introducing NCRIC</samp></h4>

<p class="TNI">NCRIC, based in San Francisco, shares information between federal agencies, local police departments across Northern California, and private industry partners, including tech companies. As I discovered by combing through the CSVs in this dataset, it also provides services to local cops, like monitoring social media or helping break into locked smartphones, and it hosts events and classes for law enforcement officers.</p>

<p class="TX">Using a custom tool I developed called BlueLeaks Explorer, which I’ll discuss in detail in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a></span>, I examined everything I could find in the <i>ncric</i> folder dated within the 13 days between George Floyd’s murder and when NCRIC was hacked. I discovered that twice a day, NCRIC emailed over 14,000 cops an updated list of Black Lives Matter protests. Local police and other partners could also log in to NCRIC’s website and submit suspicious activity reports (SARs) to distribute to the fusion center’s partners. Local police also requested NCRIC’s help with monitoring the social media accounts of protest organizers and, in two instances, with identifying threats against white female teenagers who were facing harassment after making racist statements and using anti-Black slurs.</p>

<p class="TNI">By investigating a row from a CSV file, I found a PDF of a scanned letter that turned out to be newsworthy. The letter, written by an unhinged San Francisco–area lawyer to a local district attorney’s office, called a polite student from Oregon an “antifa terrorist.” In this section, I describe how I found this revelation in BlueLeaks, what it contains, and how the BlueLeaks CSVs reference other documents in the dataset.</p>

<p class="TX">When I grepped the CSV files in the <i>ncric</i> folder for the word <i>antifa</i>, I found that there were only a handful of references in the files <i>EmailBuilder .csv</i>, <i>Requests.csv</i>, <i>SARs.csv</i>, and <i>Survey.csv</i>. In particular, this row in <i>SARs.csv</i> stood out because it referenced a student protester, allegedly a member of an antifa group, and mentioned “Radicalization/Extremism”:</p>

<p class="TX">Looking into the <i>SARs.csv</i> file, I found that it lists one month of SARs submitted to NCRIC. The earliest report was May 6, 2020, and the latest was June 6, 2020, so my guess is that NCRIC retains SARs only for a month.</p>

<p class="TX">Try opening this file, <i>ncric/SARs.csv</i>, in your spreadsheet software, and you’ll see that it’s difficult to parse. There are 91 different columns, and some of the cells are filled with so much text that even with a large monitor, you can see only part of a row at a time. To make it easier to read, I copied the content of the BriefSummary cell from the spreadsheet and pasted it into my text editor, something that I frequently needed to do with the CSVs in this dataset before I developed BlueLeaks Explorer. Here are the relevant fields from the row that caught my eye:</p>

<p class="RunInPara"><b>SARSid</b> 14277</p>

<p class="RunInPara"><b>BriefSummary</b> The attached letter was received via US Postal Service this morning. The letter was passed on from an anonymous party claiming to be a lawyer who was contacted by <i>[redacted name]</i> who is a University of Oregon student. <i>[Redacted name]</i> appears to be a member of the Antifa group and is assisting in planning protesting efforts in the Bay Area despite living in Oregon.</p>

<p class="TX">The SAR listed the full name, email address, and phone number of the person who had submitted it. I looked them up online and discovered <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_246" aria-label=" Page 246. "/>that they worked as an investigator for the district attorney’s office in Marin County (just north of San Francisco). On June 5 at 2:20 <small>PM</small> (per the FormTimestamp field), the day before NCRIC was hacked, they logged in to the NCRIC website and submitted the SAR form. They included a PDF called <i>Letter.pdf</i> (per the File1Name field), though the website saved it in the <i>SARF100014</i> folder as <i>277.pdf</i> (per the File1 field).</p>

<p class="TX">Each BlueLeaks folder has a subfolder called <i>files</i>, where you can find the files referenced in the CSV. See if you can find the PDF referenced in the File1 field in the <i>ncric</i> folder. It should be at the path <i>ncric/files/SARF100014/277.pdf</i> (see <a href="#fig9-3">Figure 9-3</a>).</p>

<p class="TX">The PDF shows a letter in all caps mailed to the Marin County DA’s office by a Bay Area attorney: “PLEASE SEE THE ATTACHED SOLICITATION I RECEIVED FROM AN ANTIFA TERRORIST WANTING MY HELP TO BAIL HER AND HER FRIENDS OUT OF JAIL, IF ARRESTED FOR RIOTING.” He explained that he was remaining <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_247" aria-label=" Page 247. "/>anonymous because he “CANNOT RISK THIS PIECE OF SHIT ANTIFA […] FILING A BAR COMPLAINT AGAINST ME,” and warned that “THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDERS WILL VIGOROUSLY DEFEND THESE TERRORISTS.” He ended his letter, “HAPPY HUNTING.”</p>

<p class="TX">Further down in the PDF, the attorney included the solicitation from the “antifa terrorist,” shown in <a href="#fig9-4">Figure 9-4</a>.</p>

Thank you very much for your time.” The Marin County DA investigator apparently believed that this was useful enough intelligence that they logged in to their account on NCRIC’s website and submitted it as “suspicious activity” for other law enforcement officers around Northern California to access. Under threat activity, they chose Radicalization/Extremism.</p>

<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_248" aria-label=" Page 248. "/>In theory, I could have stumbled upon the PDF in <a href="#fig9-3">Figure 9-3</a> on its own; I might have just randomly clicked through documents and happened to open <i>ncric/files/SARF100014/277.pdf</i>, the path to the PDF in question. I could also have indexed the <i>ncric</i> folder in Aleph, OCRing all of the documents, and searched for <i>antifa</i>. However, the PDF alone doesn’t explain who uploaded it to the NCRIC website, when and why they uploaded it, and how they described the document. Moreover, if you’re interested in focusing on activity in the fusion center from a specific time period, it’s easier to find which documents are relevant by their timestamps in the CSV files. If you’re researching BlueLeaks yourself, you can quickly find all of the documents associated with a time period by sorting the spreadsheets by date, reading all the rows in the CSVs for that time period, and looking at the documents that those rows reference.</p>

<p class="TX">Whenever you find an interesting document in BlueLeaks, search the CSVs for its filename to figure out why that document is there to begin with. It could be an attachment in a SAR, part of a bulk-email message the fusion center sent to thousands of local police, or included for other reasons. In the case of <i>277.pdf</i>, now you know this document was uploaded as an attachment to a SAR by an investigator in a DA’s office. The CSV provides the investigator’s summary of the document’s contents, along with their contact information, which you can use to reach out to them for comment before publishing your findings.</p>

<p class="TX">Now that you’ve seen the type of data <i>SARs.csv</i> contains, you need a way to easily read the long blocks of text in those CSV cells without having to copy and paste them into a text editor. We’ll cover that in Exercise 9-1, but first, let’s have a quick tutorial on how to write code that works with CSV files.</p>

</section>

<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec8">

<h3 class="H1" id="sec8"><span id="h-222"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Reading and Writing CSV Files in Python</samp></h3>

<p class="TNI">As you learned in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter8.xhtml">Chapter 8</a></span>, Python modules bring extra functionality into the script that you’re writing. It’s easy to load CSVs and turn each row into a Python dictionary using Python’s built-in <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv</samp> module. You’ll need <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv</samp> for this chapter’s exercises, so import it using the following command:</p>

<pre id="pre-386"><code><b>import csv</b></code></pre>

<p class="TX">After importing it, you can take advantage of its functionality. The <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv</samp> features I use the most are <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv.DictReader()</samp>, which lets you parse rows of a CSV as dictionaries, and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv.DictWriter()</samp>, which lets you save your own CSVs from data stored in dictionaries.</p>

<p class="TX">The following code loads a CSV file and loops through its rows by using <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv.DictReader()</samp>:</p>

<pre id="pre-387"><code>with open(csv_path) as f:

    reader = csv.DictReader(f)

    for row in reader:

        print(row)</code></pre>

<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_249" aria-label=" Page 249. "/>This code assumes the path to the CSV filename is in the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv_path</samp> variable, which could be a string that you hardcoded or a CLI argument you passed into your program. After opening the CSV file with <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">open(csv _path)</samp> and storing the file objects as <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">f</samp>, the code defines a new variable called <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">reader</samp> and sets its value to <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv.DictReader(f)</samp>, which prepares you to read rows from this CSV. The <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">reader</samp> object acts a little like a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row. Although it’s not actually a list, you can use a <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">for</samp> loop to loop through it as if it were. Inside the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">for</samp> loop, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">row</samp> is a dictionary that represents the data in a row from the spreadsheet.</p>

<p class="TX">The process of saving new CSVs is similar to loading them, except you use <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv.DictWriter()</samp>. For example, the following code uses Python to save the <i>city-populations.csv</i> file discussed in the <span class="Xref">“Introducing the CSV File Format”</span> section earlier in this chapter:</p>

<pre id="pre-388"><code>headers = ["City", "Country", "Population"]

with open(csv_path, "w") as f:

    writer = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=headers)

    writer.writeheader()

    writer.writerow({"City": "Tōkyō", "Country": "Japan", "Population": 37400000})

    writer.writerow({"City": "Delhi", "Country": "India", "Population": 28514000})

    writer.writerow({"City": "Shanghai", "Country": "China", "Population": 25582000})

    writer.writerow({"City": "São Paulo", "Country": "Brazil", "Population": 21650000})

    writer.writerow({"City": "Mexico City", "Country": "Mexico", "Population": 21581000})

    writer.writerow({"City": "Cairo", "Country": "Egypt", "Population": 20076000})</code></pre>

<p class="TX">This code first defines the headers of the spreadsheet in the list <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">headers</samp>, then opens the output file (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv_path</samp>) for writing. Creating a <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv.DictWriter()</samp> object allows you to save data into the CSV. You must pass the headers in as a keyword argument called <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">fieldnames</samp>. You must also run <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">writer .writeheader()</samp>, which saves the header row to the CSV file, before writing any of the data rows.</p>

<p class="TX">You can then add rows to the spreadsheet by running <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">writer.writerow()</samp>, passing in a dictionary whose keys match your headers. For example, the first call of <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">writer.writerow()</samp> passes in the dictionary <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">{"City": "Tōkyō", "Country": "Japan", "Population": 37400000}</samp>. The keys for this dictionary are the same as the headers for the CSV: <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">City</samp>, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Country</samp>, and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Population</samp>.</p>

<p class="TX">In the following exercises, you’ll use your new CSV programming skills to write scripts that make the data hidden in BlueLeaks CSVs easier to read and understand.</p>

<p class="TNI">While it’s easier to read <i>SARs.csv</i> in a spreadsheet program than in a text editor, it’s still quite difficult. As mentioned earlier, there are 91 columns (though most of their values are blank), and some of the text fields, like BriefSummary, contain way too much text to see at one time in a spreadsheet cell. In this exercise, you’ll write a script that makes <i>SARs.csv</i> (or any CSV with similar content) easier to read by showing you the data a single row at a time.</p>

<p class="TX">This exercise is designed not just to show you how to work with the <i>SARs.csv</i> file, but to give you practice looping through the rows and fields in a CSV. These skills will come in handy whenever you write code that reads data from CSVs.</p>

<p class="TX">For a challenge, you could try programming your own script to meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul class="BL">

<li class="BL">Make this script accept an argument called <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv_path</samp> using Click, which you first learned to use in Exercise 8-3.</li>
<li class="BL">Import the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv</samp> module and loop through all of the rows in the CSV located at <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv_path</samp>, loading each row as a dictionary, as discussed in the previous section.</li>
<li class="BL">For each row, display all of the <i>non-empty</i> values for its columns. If a value is empty, meaning it’s an empty string (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">""</samp>), skip it. There’s no reason to display all of the columns when so many of them have blank values.</li>
<li class="BL">Display each field on its own line. For example, one line could show <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">SARSid: 14277</samp> and the next line could show <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">FormTimeStamp: 06/05/20 14:20:09</samp>.</li>
<li class="BL">Output a separator line like <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">===</samp> between each row so that you can tell rows apart.</li>
</ul>

<p class="TX">Alternatively, follow along with the rest of this exercise and I’ll walk you through the programming process. Start with the usual Python script template in a file called <i>exercise-9-1.py</i>:</p>

<pre id="pre-389"><code>def main():

    pass



if __name__ == "__main__":

    main()</code></pre>

<p class="TX">Next, you’ll modify your script to accept the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv_path</samp> argument.</p>

<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec10">

<h4 class="H2" id="sec10"><span id="h-224"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Accept the CSV Path as an Argument</samp></h4>

<p class="TNI">Instead of hardcoding the path to a specific CSV, let’s use Click to accept the path as an argument. Here’s the code that does that (with modifications shown in bold):</p>
<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_251" aria-label=" Page 251. "/>

<pre id="pre-390"><code><b>import click</b>



<b>@click.command()</b>

<b>@click.argument("csv_path")</b>

def main(<b>csv_path</b>):

    <b>"""Make BlueLeaks CSVs easier to read"""</b>

    <b>print(f"CSV path: {csv_path}")</b>



if __name__ == "__main__":

    main()</code></pre>

<p class="TX">Just like in Exercise 8-4, this code imports the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">click</samp> module, adds Click decorators before the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">main()</samp> function to turn it into a command that accepts the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv_path</samp> argument, and adds a docstring. For now, it also displays the value of <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv_path</samp> so you can test if the program works. Run the code to test it as follows:</p>

<pre id="pre-391"><code>micah@trapdoor chapter-9 % <b>python3 exercise-9-1.py some-csv-path.csv</b>

CSV path: some-csv-path.csv</code></pre>

<p class="TX">The script just displays the CSV path that was passed in. So far, so good.</p>

<p class="TNI">Next, you’ll modify the code to open the CSV in <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv_path</samp>, and, using the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv</samp> module, create a <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv.DictReader()</samp> object to loop through the rows of that CSV:</p>

        <b>for row in reader:</b>

            <b>print(row)</b>



if __name__ == "__main__":

     main()</code></pre>

<p class="TX">This code now imports the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv</samp> module at the top. When the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">main()</samp> function runs, the code opens the file at <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv_path</samp> for reading, creating a file object variable called <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">f</samp>. As noted in <span class="Xref">“Reading and Writing CSV Files in Python,”</span> you can use <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv.DictReader()</samp> to loop through a CSV file, getting access to each row as a dictionary. The code does this next, creating a variable called <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">reader</samp> and setting it equal to <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv.DictReader(f)</samp>. Using <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">reader</samp>, the code then loops through each row and displays the dictionary containing its data.</p>

<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_252" aria-label=" Page 252. "/>Test the code again, this time passing in the path to <i>SARs.csv</i> as the CLI argument. Make sure you use the correct path for your copy of the BlueLeaks dataset:</p>

BriefSummary: Handheld radio went missing. Radio was in the dozer tender or in the office of

the Santa Rosa shop at station 41. The dozer tender was parked outside of the shop. There has

been unknown individuals seen passing on the compound near the shop. Dozer tender did not

appear to have been broken into. Dozer tender is usually locked but could have been missed

while the operator was off duty. Unsure of when exactly the radio went missing. Could of been

anytime within the last month.

<h3 class="H1" id="sec13"><span id="h-227"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">How to Read Bulk Email from Fusion Centers</samp></h3>

<p class="TNI">The primary purpose of fusion centers is to share information between local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies. They do this, essentially, by sending bulk email to a large list of local police officers. You can find the content of this email for all sites in BlueLeaks, including NCRIC, in the <i>EmailBuilder.csv</i> file located in each site’s folder. These files include the content of all of the bulk-email messages each fusion center sent until June 6, 2020, when it was hacked.</p>

<p class="TX">Some of these messages are security bulletins from federal agencies like the FBI or the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Others contain content directly created by the fusion center—for example, NCRIC and other fusion centers around the US generated detailed daily lists of protests against police brutality during the summer of 2020. For the 13 days of NCRIC data that I looked at in detail, over half of the bulk email contained information about largely peaceful protests.</p>

<p class="TX">The SARs spreadsheet contains plaintext data, so it’s easy to read in a text editor. But the bulk-email spreadsheet contains data in HyperText Markup Language (HTML) format, making it difficult to read unless you use a web browser. In this section, you’ll learn to more easily read the HTML content of NCRIC’s bulk email, find the recipients of each email, and find the documents attached to the email messages. Open <i>ncric/EmailBuilder.csv</i> in your spreadsheet software to follow along.</p>

<h4 class="H2" id="sec14"><span id="h-228"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Lists of Black Lives Matter Demonstrations</samp></h4>

<p class="TNI">Most of the intelligence on Black Lives Matter protests flowed through NCRIC’s Terrorism Liaison Officer (TLO) program, whose purpose is to keep the intelligence center’s members “engaged &amp; knowledgeable about current terrorist tactics, techniques &amp; trends, regional crime trends &amp; threats, and Officer safety information,” according to the TLO page on NCRIC’s website. During the summer of 2020, this counterterrorism program didn’t focus on terrorism so much as upcoming racial justice protests.</p>

<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_255" aria-label=" Page 255. "/>This section describes the twice-daily lists of upcoming protests that TLO sent to thousands of local cops. Not only is this incredibly newsworthy—a counterterrorism program abused to monitor racial justice protests—but these were the most common bulk-email messages that NCRIC sent during the 13-day period I examined.</p>

<p class="TX">For example, here are the most interesting fields from the most recent row in <i>ncric/EmailBuilder.csv</i> (this CSV has 81 columns in total, most of which didn’t contain any relevant information):</p>

<p class="RunInPara"><b>SentEmailList</b> EBSE00006\170.csv</p>

<p class="TX">This row tells us that on the evening of June 6, 2020, NCRIC sent an email with the subject line “NCRIC TLO Bulletin LES” to the list of people described in <i>EBSE00006\170.csv</i> (LES stands for Law Enforcement Sensitive). The email included the PDF attachment located at <i>EBAT1\Events_060620_1800.pdf</i>.</p>

<p class="TX">The body of the email is the HTML in the EmailBody column. HTML is the markup language that describes web pages, so it can be hard to make sense of when you’re not viewing it in a web browser. To read this email body, in your text editor, create a new file called <i>EmailBuilder-6170.html</i> (since 6170 is the EmailBuilderID). Copy the content of the EmailBody field from your spreadsheet software for this row, paste it into this file, and save it. You can now open this file in a web browser to view it, but before you do that, you may want to read the <span class="Xref">“Covering Your Tracks with a VPN Service”</span> box to consider mitigating what information you might leak by opening it.</p>
<aside class="box" aria-labelledby="box-21">

<h5 class="BH" id="box-21"><samp class="SANS_Dogma_OT_Bold_B_11">COVERING YOUR TRACKS WITH A VPN SERVICE</samp></h5>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">The BlueLeaks CSV files are full of HTML code, such as the EmailBody field in the</samp> <samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">EmailBuilder.csv</samp> <samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">files. Many of these blocks of HTML include embedded images. If you read through the HTML code in the EmailBody cell in the preceding example, you’ll see that it loads an image hosted on NCRIC’s server at the</samp> <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_256" aria-label=" Page 256.

These servers will most likely log your IP address, leaving clues that you’re investigating them.</samp></p>

<p class="BoxBody"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">For the BlueLeaks dataset, it doesn’t matter much if the fusion center servers track your IP address. It’s not illegal to load images off of law enforcement websites. For more sensitive datasets, however, it’s prudent to hide your IP address from organizations you’re investigating. You can load these images while hiding your real IP address by connecting to a</samp> <samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">virtual private network (VPN)</samp> <samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">service, which reroutes your internet traffic through its own server, then forwards your traffic to those websites. This leaves the VPN server’s IP address, rather than your own, in the websites’ web logs.</samp></p>

<p class="BoxBody"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">For example, say you load the</samp> <samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">EmailBuilder-6170.html</samp> <samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">file in your web browser from your home in San Francisco.

The site might be able to determine that this IP address belongs to you by sending a data request to your internet service provider, for example. If you first connect to a VPN, however—one in New York, let’s say—then they’ll see a New York IP address from a data center in their logs instead. They’ll still know that someone loaded the image, but it won’t be immediately obvious that</samp> <samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">you</samp> <samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">loaded the image. Everyone using that VPN service shares its IP address, making it harder to track down individual users.</samp></p>

<p class="BoxBody"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">While VPNs may make you anonymous from the websites you’re visiting, they don’t make you anonymous from the VPN provider itself. Use a trustworthy VPN provider that you believe isn’t logging your traffic and selling it. Additionally, contrary to popular opinion, commercial VPN services don’t prevent websites from tracking your browsing habits; that’s mostly done using a technology called cookies. In other words, VPNs don’t stop the Googles and Facebooks of the world from following you around the web.</samp></p>

<p class="BoxBodyLast"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Consumer Reports</samp> <samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">publishes in-depth reviews of different VPN services, comparing them on overall privacy and security, whether they’ve had public security audits, whether they’re open source, and whether they include misleading marketing. VPN services normally cost a few dollars a month. For the most part, I recommend avoiding free VPNs; they’re nearly all scams set up to spy on their users and sell their data, or even to inject advertisements into web pages users visit. The only exception I know of are VPNs powered by the open source software Bitmask, like the one run by the Seattle-based tech collective Riseup.

<p class="TX">As you can see from the screenshot, this email body is a template, not the email itself. The HTML files stored inside CSVs for BlueLeaks sites are all templates.

<p class="TX">You can use the SentEmailList and EmailTable values to discover how many, and exactly which, local police officers received these daily bulletins. The value of SentEmailList is the path to a CSV file itself: <i>EBSE00006\170.csv</i>. When you open that CSV file (it’s in <i>ncric/files</i>), you can see that it has 14,459 rows (one of which is the header) and looks like this:</p>

<pre id="pre-397"><code>IDs,Registrations

63861

63862

63929

63930

<var>--snip--</var></code></pre>

<p class="TX">In short, this CSV contains a huge list of ID numbers. The value of EmailTable in the <i>EmailBuilder.csv</i> row is <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Registrations</samp>, which is a good hint. Since I knew that these IDs must match up to rows in some other table, I decided to check the file <i>Registrations.csv</i>.</p>

<p class="TX">Open that spreadsheet yourself at <i>ncric/Registrations.csv</i>. It has 185 columns and over 29,000 rows, apparently listing everyone who had an account on NCRIC’s website. It includes each user’s full name; the agency they work for and whether it’s local, state, federal, or military; their email address, physical address, and cell phone number; their supervisor’s name and contact information; their password hash; and other details.</p>

<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_259" aria-label=" Page 259. "/>The first column of <i>Registrations.csv</i> is called RegistrationsID. Each ID in the <i>EBSE00006\170.csv</i> file can be cross-referenced with one of these registrations. For example, the person in <i>Registrations.csv</i> with the RegistrationsID 63861 works at the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office, lives in San Jose, has an email address at the domain pro.sccgov.org, and has a phone number with a 408 area code. In other words, NCRIC sent the email to this list of 14,458 contacts, whose contact details can be found in the <i>Registrations.csv</i> file. The BlueLeaks dataset includes this information about everyone who received bulk email through any of the websites. In Exercise 9-3, when you read through bulk email found in BlueLeaks, you’ll be able to look up exactly who received these email messages.</p>

<h4 class="H2" id="sec15"><span id="h-229"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">“Intelligence” Memos from the FBI and DHS</samp></h4>

<p class="TNI">As mentioned earlier, in addition to detailed lists of upcoming protests, NCRIC also frequently forwarded memos from its federal partners—agencies like the FBI and DHS—to its list of over 14,000 local cops. These memos largely contained internet rumors, hoaxes that had already been debunked but that federal agencies apparently fell for, and warnings about violence from protesters that didn’t materialize.</p>

<p class="TX">For example, in the row in <i>EmailBuilder.csv</i> with the EmailBuilderID of 6169, the email body says, “The NCRIC is disseminating this (U//LES) Update on behalf of the FBI.” The Attachment1 value in that row is <i>EBAT1\SITREP-6-JUN-1300_OPE.pdf</i>, an unclassified FBI document dated June 6, 2020. The document is full of cherry-picked quotes from social media posts threatening violence, but without any context. There was no way of knowing how many followers an account had, how much engagement their post had, or even if they were parodies.</p>

<p class="TX">The “Social Media Exploitation (SOMEX)” section of this FBI document describes people using Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram to post “flyers seeking to hire ‘professional anarchists.’ ” This appears to reference an internet hoax from late May 2020. In fact, I found multiple articles debunking this hoax on fact-checking sites, including Snopes, PolitiFact, and <i>Reuters</i>, dated a week before the FBI distributed this memo. The fake recruitment flyer offers to compensate “professional anarchists” with $200 per direct action, and includes the text “Funded by George Soros.” (Antisemitic right-wing Americans frequently and falsely claim that Soros, a Jewish billionaire, funds left-wing protesters.) The flyer also included the phone number for a local branch of the Democratic Party. Both this local Democratic Party branch and Soros’s Open Society Foundations confirmed that the flyer was a fake, but this didn’t stop the FBI from distributing it to NCRIC, which disseminated it to 14,458 local police across Northern California.</p>

<p class="TX">The DHS also sent several memos to NCRIC to distribute to the center’s list. For example, take a look at the row in <i>EmailBuilder.csv</i> with the EmailBuilderID of 6144. The email body says, “The NCRIC is disseminating the Intelligence Note ‘(U//FOUO) Some Violent Opportunists Probably Engaging in Organized Activities’ on behalf of DHS,” and the attached <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_260" aria-label=" Page 260. "/>document is <i>EBAT1\(U—FOUO) IN - Some Violent Opportunists Probably Engaging in Organized Activities 06012020.pdf</i>.</p>

<p class="TX">The attached PDF declares, “As the protests persist, we assess that the organized violent opportunists—including suspected anarchist extremists—could increasingly perpetrate nationwide targeting of law enforcement and critical infrastructure.” (This didn’t happen.) The memo goes on to say that an NYPD official “had strong evidence that suspected anarchist groups had planned to incite violence at protests, including by using encrypted communications.” Incidentally, if you completed Exercise 2-2 and installed Signal, you too are now a user of encrypted communications.</p>

<p class="TX">As noted in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter1.xhtml">Chapter 1</a></span>, it’s important to reach out to the people you’re investigating to get their side of the story. Mike Sena, NCRIC’s executive director, told me that his intelligence agency was monitoring Black Lives Matters protests in order to make sure that they remained safe. “We weren’t keeping track of the protests themselves, but we were identifying where we were gonna have gatherings of people,” he said. “That’s our concern; we want to make sure the events are safe—and if there are any threats that come up that may be associated with any of those events that we’re able to get that threat data to whatever agency may have protection responsibilities.”</p>

<p class="TX">It’s also good practice to contact outside experts—those who know more about the subject matter than you do—for comment. Vasudha Talla, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, told me, “Really what we have here is overbroad collection and dissemination of people’s protected First Amendment activity, and it’s untethered to any basis in the law.”</p>

<p class="TX">As you can see, there are a lot of newsworthy details in <i>EmailBuilder.csv</i>. However, it’s still somewhat difficult to work with, especially because of the HTML email bodies. Soon you’ll write some code to make all of the bulk email easier to read. To do that, first you will need to learn the basics of HTML.</p>

</section>

<h3 class="H1" id="sec16"><span id="h-230"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">A Brief HTML Primer</samp></h3>

<p class="TNI">In the following exercise, you’ll write some Python code that in turn writes some HTML code. This section covers just enough HTML syntax to get you through this chapter.</p>

<p class="TX">HTML is made up of components called <i>tags</i>. For example, consider the following HTML:</p>

<pre id="pre-398"><code>&lt;p&gt;Hello world&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

<p class="TX">This code opens a <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;p&gt;</samp> tag (which represents a paragraph), includes some content (the text <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Hello world</samp>), and then closes the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;p&gt;</samp> tag with <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;/p&gt;</samp>. You open a tag with <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;</samp><samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_Italic_I_11">tag-name</samp><samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&gt;</samp> and close it with <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;/</samp><samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_Italic_I_11">tag-name</samp><samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&gt;</samp>.</p>

<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_261" aria-label=" Page 261. "/>HTML typically includes tags inside of tags inside of tags. It’s common to indent HTML code for legibility, but unlike in Python, indenting is completely optional. Here’s an example of a simple web page in HTML, indented to make it easier to read:</p>

<pre id="pre-399"><code>&lt;html&gt;

    &lt;head&gt;

        &lt;title&gt;My Super Cool Web Page&lt;/title&gt;

    &lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;body&gt;

        &lt;h1&gt;Under Construction&lt;/h1&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This web page is under construction!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

<p class="TX">The whole page is wrapped in the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;html&gt;</samp> tag. Inside that, there’s a <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;head&gt;</samp> tag, which includes metadata about the web page, and then a <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;body&gt;</samp> tag, which includes the content of the web page. The <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;title&gt;</samp> tag is a metadata tag that describes the title of the web page, which is what’s displayed in the browser tab itself. Inside the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;body&gt;</samp>, the biggest heading is <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;h1&gt;</samp>, followed by a <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;p&gt;</samp> paragraph.</p>

<p class="TX">There are plenty of other tags in HTML, but in the following exercise, you’ll use just two more: <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;ul&gt;</samp> and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;li&gt;</samp>. The <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;ul&gt;</samp> tag stands for “unordered list,” and it’s how you make bulleted lists in HTML. Inside the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;ul&gt;</samp> tag are <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;li&gt;</samp> tags, which stand for “list item.” For example, here’s some HTML for a simple bulleted list:</p>

<pre id="pre-400"><code>&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Bash&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;Python&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;HTML&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>

<p class="TX">When displayed in a web browser, that HTML code would look like this:</p>
<ul class="BL">

<li class="BL">Bash</li>
<li class="BL">Python</li>
<li class="BL">HTML</li>
</ul>

<p class="TX">The less-than and greater-than characters (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;</samp> and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&gt;</samp>) are used to open and close tags in HTML. If you want to display literal less-than or greater-than characters in HTML, you have to <i>HTML escape</i> them. This is similar to escaping in shell scripts and Python code, but the syntax is different. Escape <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;</samp> by replacing it with <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&amp;lt;</samp> and escape <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&gt;</samp> by replacing it with <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&amp;gt;</samp>. For example, here’s some HTML code that displays the text <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">I</samp> <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;3 you</samp> in a paragraph:</p>

<pre id="pre-401"><code>&lt;p&gt;I &amp;lt;3 you&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

<p class="TX">There are a few other special characters in HTML that are each escaped in their own way. For example, you’d use <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&amp;amp;</samp> to escape an ampersand (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&amp;</samp>).</p>

<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_262" aria-label=" Page 262.

This will also make it much simpler for you to find the newsworthy ones.</p>

<h3 class="H1F" id="sec17"><span id="h-231"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Heavy_B_21">Exercise 9-2: Make Bulk Email Readable</samp></h3>

<p class="TNI">For this exercise, you’ll write a script similar to the one you wrote in Exercise 9-1, but instead of displaying text output to the screen, you’ll save HTML output to files. This allows you to look through a folder full of HTML files, each one a different bulk email, open these files in a web browser, and read them in a more legible format. While this particular exercise is designed specifically for the <i>EmailBuilder.csv</i> files in BlueLeaks, it’s common to find HTML in datasets, so being able to write a similar script could help you in the future.</p>

<p class="TX">For a challenge, you can try programming your own script to meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul class="BL">

<li class="BL">Make this script accept two arguments called <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">emailbuilder_csv_path</samp> and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">output_folder_path</samp> using Click. The <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">emailbuilder_csv_path</samp> argument should be the path to an <i>EmailBuilder.csv</i> file, and the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">output_folder_path</samp> argument should be the path to a folder in which to save the HTML files.</li>
<li class="BL">Make sure the folder at <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">output_folder_path</samp> exists by importing the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">os</samp> module and running <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">os.makedirs(output_folder_path, exist_ok=True)</samp>.</li>
<li class="BL">Import the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv</samp> module and loop through all of the rows in the CSV located at <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">emailbuilder_csv_path</samp>, loading each row as a dictionary.</li>
<li class="BL">For each row, save a new HTML file. This file should include information from the bulk-email fields most relevant for your purposes: EmailBuilderID, EmailFrom, EmailSubject, DateSent, Attachment1, and SentEmailList. It should also include the HTML body of the email itself, EmailBody.</li>
</ul>

<p class="TX">Otherwise, follow along with the rest of this exercise and I’ll walk you through the programming process. Start with the usual Python script template in a file called <i>exercise-9-2.py</i>:</p>

<pre id="pre-402"><code>def main():

    <b>print(f"Output folder path: {output_folder_path}")</b>



if __name__ == "__main__":

    main()</code></pre>

<p class="TX">First, the code imports the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">click</samp> module, and then it uses Click decorators to make the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">main()</samp> function a Click command that accepts two arguments, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">emailbuilder_csv_path</samp> and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">output_folder_path</samp>. The code also has two <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">print()</samp> statements that display the values of the two arguments. The <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">emailbuilder_csv_path</samp> argument should point to the path of a BlueLeaks <i>EmailBuilder.csv</i>, which you’ll load and loop through, and the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">output_folder _path</samp> argument should be the path to a folder in which you’ll store the HTML files for the bulk-email messages.</p>

<p class="TX">Test your code and make sure it’s working as expected so far, replacing the path to <i>EmailBuilder.csv</i> with the appropriate path for your computer:</p>

This way, the first time you run this script with a specific output folder, it will create that folder and use it to store the HTML files. If you run the script again in the future with that same output folder, it will use the folder that’s already there.</p>

<h4 class="H2" id="sec20"><span id="h-234"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Define the Filename for Each Row</samp></h4>

<p class="TNI">The goal of this script is to save an HTML file for each row in the spreadsheet. To do this, you’ll need to load the CSV, loop through its rows, and figure out the filename for each HTML file that you’re going to save. Next, define the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">filename</samp> variable, naming each HTML file based on data that you found in that row. To do so, make the following modifications:</p>

<pre id="pre-406"><code>import click

import os

<b>import csv</b>



@click.command()

@click.argument("emailbuilder_csv_path")

@click.argument("output_folder_path")

            <b>filename = filename.replace("/", "-")</b>

            <b>filename = os.path.join(output_folder_path, filename)</b>

            <b>print(filename)</b>



if __name__ == "__main__":

    main()</code></pre>

<p class="TX">The script starts by importing the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv</samp> module. As in the previous exercise, the code then opens the CSV file and creates a CSV reader using <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv.DictReader()</samp>. Using a <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">for</samp> loop, the code loops through each row in the CSV.</p>

<p class="TX">Rather than just displaying information, you ultimately want to save each row as an HTML file. To prepare to write the code that actually generates those files in the next section, this code defines a <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">filename</samp> variable with the name of the unique HTML file to be generated for each row. In <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_265" aria-label=" Page 265. "/>order to make it unique, the code defines <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">filename</samp> using the current row’s EmailBuilderID, DateSent, and EmailSubject fields, and ends it with the.<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">html</samp> file extension. For example, according to this format, the filename for the bulk email described in the previous section would be <i>6170_06/06/20 20:25:06_NCRIC TLO Bulletin LES.html</i>.</p>

<p class="TX">The code defines <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">filename</samp> as an f-string surrounded in double quotes (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">"</samp>). The variables inside it, like <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">row["EmailSubject"]</samp>, have quotes of their own, but you can’t use the double-quote character inside a double-quoted f-string without Python mistakenly thinking you’re closing the f-string. Instead, this code uses single quotes (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">'</samp>) for the variables within the f-string: <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">row['EmailSubject']</samp>.</p>

<p class="TX">The slash characters (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">/</samp>) contained in the DateSent column are invalid characters for filenames because slashes separate folders in a path. To address this, the line <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">filename</samp> <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">=</samp> <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">filename.replace("/", "-")</samp> replaces any slashes it finds in the filename with dash characters (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">-</samp>). This generates the valid filename <i>6170_06-06-20 20:25:06_NCRIC TLO Bulletin LES.html</i>.</p>

<p class="TX">Finally, this code uses <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">os.path.join()</samp>, discussed in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter8.xhtml">Chapter 8</a></span>, to append <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">filename</samp> to the end of <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">output_folder_path</samp>, giving you the complete path to the file you’re going to write. You’ll ultimately save the HTML file in this path. For example, if the filename <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">output_folder_path</samp> is <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">output</samp> and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">filename</samp> is <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">6170_06-06-20 20:25:06_NCRIC TLO Bulletin LES.html</samp>, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">os.path.join()</samp> updates <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">filename</samp> to be <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">output/6170_06-06-20 20:25:06_NCRIC TLO Bulletin LES.html</samp>.</p>

<p class="TX">To make sure everything is working so far, the code displays this final filename. Pause and test your code, using the correct filepath for your operating system:</p>

<p class="TX">First, the code imports the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">html</samp> module, which will be used later on to escape HTML code. The code starts by defining a list, called <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">important_keys</samp>, of all of the important keys to include in the final HTML file. This code is positioned near the top of the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">main()</samp> function, before the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">for</samp> loop, so that this variable will be available inside each loop, and therefore every HTML file will include these same fields.</p>

<p class="TX">Inside the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">for</samp> loop, the code stores each row of the spreadsheet in the dictionary <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">row</samp>, so you can access its fields using keys. Then, the code opens the HTML file for writing with the command <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">with open(filename, "w") as</samp> <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_267" aria-label=" Page 267.

The file object for the HTML file is the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">html_f</samp> variable. Inside this <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">with</samp> statement, the code then starts writing the HTML file by calling <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">html_f.write()</samp> and passing in a string containing HTML, first for <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;html&gt;</samp> and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;body&gt;</samp> tags and then for a <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;ul&gt;</samp> tag to represent a bulleted list.</p>

<p class="TX">Next, the code fills in the bulleted list with the important metadata. Using a <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">for</samp> loop, it loops through the keys in <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">important_keys</samp>, writing each piece of metadata to the HTML file in its own <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;li</samp><samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&gt;</samp> tag, in the format</p>

<pre id="pre-409"><code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;<var>metadata_item</var>:&lt;/strong&gt; <var>metadata_value</var>&lt;/li&gt;</code></pre>

<p class="BodyContinued">where <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_Italic_I_11">metadata_item</samp> is the name of an important piece of metadata in <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">key</samp>, and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_Italic_I_11">metadata_value</samp> is the value of that piece of metadata in <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">row[key]</samp>. For example, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_Italic_I_11">metadata_item</samp> might be <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">EmailBuilderID</samp>, and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_Italic_I_11">metadata_value</samp> might be <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">6170</samp>, as in the example CSV row in the <span class="Xref">“Lists of Black Lives Matter Demonstrations”</span> section.</p>

<p class="TX">Instead of displaying the value with <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">row[key]</samp>, though, this line of code uses <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">html.escape(row[key])</samp>. This is necessary because some of the fields you want to include use angle brackets (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;</samp> and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&gt;</samp>), which indicate tags in HTML. For example, if the value of the FromEmail field is <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">NCRIC</samp> <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;info@ncric.net&gt;</samp>, your web browser will interpret <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;info@ncric.net&gt;</samp> as an HTML tag called <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">info@ncric.net</samp>, which isn’t a real tag, so nothing will display. In Python, the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">html.escape()</samp> function lets you HTML escape a string. For example, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">html.escape("NCRIC</samp> <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;info@ncric.net&gt;")</samp> returns the string <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">NCRIC &amp;lt;info@ncric.net&amp;gt;</samp> and that’s what gets saved to the HTML file, so that when you later view that file, the string displays correctly as <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">NCRIC</samp> <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;info@ncric.net&gt;</samp>.</p>

<p class="TX">When the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">for</samp> loop finishes running, all of the important metadata will have been written to the HTML file. The code then writes <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;/ul&gt;</samp> to close the bulleted list tag. After displaying the bulleted list of important fields, the code displays the EmailBody field in a <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;</samp><samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">div&gt;</samp> tag. This time, it doesn’t HTML escape this field, because you want to load the email’s HTML in a browser. Finally, the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;body&gt;</samp> and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;html&gt;</samp> tags are closed with <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</samp>.</p>

<p class="TX">This output looks similar to the last time you ran the script, except now it also creates a folder full of 5,213 new HTML files—one for every row of NCRIC’s <i>EmailBuilder.csv</i> file—in the output folder you specified. The <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_268" aria-label=" Page 268. "/>information now included in the filenames allows you to browse through the files in your file manager, exploring those that look most interesting.</p>

<p class="TX"><a href="#fig9-7">Figure 9-7</a> shows the list of files generated when I ran this script.</p>

<p class="TX">This folder contains the thousands of HTML files that your Python script just created. The first part of the filename is the EmailBuilderID, followed by DateSent, followed by EmailSubject. To read one of these bulk emails, just double-click the HTML file to open it in a web browser. If you want more information about a specific bulk email, you can always look it up by EmailBuilderID in the original spreadsheet.</p>

<p class="TX">To see what the final HTML output looks like, open one of these files in your text editor. For example, here’s the final HTML output from the <i>6098_05-18-20 12/45/12_Chasing Cell Phones presented via Zoom Webinar.html</i> file:</p>

<pre id="pre-411"><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;

<p class="TX"><a href="#fig9-8">Figure 9-8</a> shows what these bulk email messages look like in a web browser. In this case, I opened a bulk email sent out on May 18, 2020, advertising a course called Chasing Cell Phones hosted by the Northern California High Intensity Drug Tracking Area. The class was designed to teach police how to get valuable evidence directly off of suspects’ cell phones or from third-party sources like cell phone providers.</p>

<p class="TX">You can use the script from this exercise to make the bulk email from any BlueLeaks folder more readable; just run the script on the appropriate <i>EmailBuilder.csv</i> file.</p>

<p class="TX">The BlueLeaks folder names alone don’t immediately make clear which folders belong to which organizations. Let’s fix that by creating a spreadsheet that associates each BlueLeaks folder with its organization name, website title, and URL.</p>

<p class="TNI">It’s obvious what organization some BlueLeaks folders belong to based on the folder name. You can reasonably guess that the <i>alabamafusioncenter</i> folder has data from the Alabama Fusion Center. But most aren’t so clear. Can you guess what <i>ciacco</i> is? How about <i>nvhidta</i> or <i>snorca</i>?</p>

<p class="TX">After manually looking through the CSV files in various BlueLeaks folders, I discovered that the file <i>Company.csv</i> contains, hidden among its 108 columns, the name and URL of each site. Some BlueLeaks folders, it turns out, host more than one site. For example, in <a href="#tab9-3">Table 9-3</a>, which shows these columns from NCRIC’s <i>Company.csv</i> file, you can see that the <i>ncric</i> folder hosts 18 different sites at different URLs.</p>

<p class="TX">As you can see here, the <i>ncric</i> folder hosts not only the NCRIC site but also the sites for the Northern California High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (NCHIDTA); the Northern California Most Wanted, which lists wanted fugitives; and others. However, all these websites share the same code and databases.</p>

<p class="TX">Since almost every BlueLeaks folder contains a <i>Company.csv</i> file listing all of the sites associated with that folder, we can write a script to automatically extract this information and format it as a CSV file. This will open the door for you to pick which fusion center you want to research—perhaps there’s one in a city near you.</p>

<h3 class="H1F" id="sec23"><span id="h-237"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Heavy_B_21">Exercise 9-3: Make a CSV of BlueLeaks Sites</samp></h3>

<p class="TNI">The script you write in this exercise will loop through each BlueLeaks folder, open its <i>Company.csv</i> file, and save information about the organizations whose websites are hosted in that folder into a CSV file that you create. For a challenge, you can try programming your own script to do the following:</p>
<ul class="BL">

<li class="BL">Accept two arguments: <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">blueleaks_path</samp>, the path to your extracted BlueLeaks data, and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">output_csv_path</samp>, the path to the new CSV file that the script will create.</li>
<li class="BL">Include these headers: <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">BlueLeaksFolder</samp> (the BlueLeaks folder name), <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">CompanyID</samp>, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">CompanyName</samp>, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">WebsiteTitle</samp>, and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">URL</samp> (you’ll find these latter fields in the various <i>Company.csv</i> files).</li>
<li class="BL">Open <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">output_csv_path</samp> for writing and create a <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv.DictWriter()</samp> object (see <span class="listbullet_Xref">“Reading and Writing CSV Files in Python”</span> on <span class="listbullet_Xref">page 248</span>), passing in the file object and the headers.</li>
<li class="BL">Loop through each folder in BlueLeaks. You can get a list of all the filenames with <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">os.listdir(blueleaks_path)</samp>.</li>
<li class="BL">Inside each BlueLeaks folder, open the <i>Company.csv</i> file if it exists, and loop through all of the rows in that CSV. For each row, select the information you want to save and then write it to your CSV.</li>
<li class="BL">Map out exactly what websites each BlueLeaks folder hosts in your output CSV.</li>
</ul>

<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_272" aria-label=" Page 272. "/>Otherwise, the rest of this exercise will walk you through the programming process. Start with the usual Python script template in a file called <i>exercise-9-3.py</i>:</p>

<pre id="pre-412"><code>def main():

    pass



if __name__ == "__main__":

    main()</code></pre>

<p class="TX">Next, modify your script to accept the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">blueleaks_path</samp> and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">output_csv_path</samp> command line arguments:</p>

<pre id="pre-413"><code><b>import click</b>

def main(<b>blueleaks_path, output_csv_path</b>):

    <b>"""Make a CSV that describes all the BlueLeaks folders"""</b>



if __name__ == "__main__":

    main()</code></pre>

<p class="TX">You’ve done this enough times at this point that you can safely assume the arguments are working properly without testing the script.</p>

<h4 class="H2" id="sec24"><span id="h-238"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Open a CSV for Writing</samp></h4>

<p class="TNI">The simplest way to program this script is to first open a CSV file for writing and then loop through each folder in BlueLeaks, adding rows to this CSV. Start by just opening the CSV file for writing, using the following code:</p>

<pre id="pre-414"><code>import click

<b>import csv</b>



@click.command()

@click.argument("blueleaks_path")

@click.argument("output_csv_path")

def main(blueleaks_path, output_csv_path):

    """Make a CSV that describes all the BlueLeaks folders"""

    <b>headers = ["BlueLeaksFolder", "CompanyID", "CompanyName", "WebsiteTitle", "URL"]</b>

    <b>with open(output_csv_path, "w") as output_f:</b>

        <b>writer = csv.DictWriter(output_f, fieldnames=headers)</b>

        <b>writer.writeheader()</b>



if __name__ == "__main__":

    main()</code></pre>

<p class="TX">First, the code imports the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv</samp> module. It then defines what the headers of the output CSV will be in the variable <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">headers</samp>. As noted in <span class="Xref">“Reading and</span> <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_273" aria-label=" Page 273. "/><span class="Xref">Writing CSV Files in Python,”</span> in order to create a <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv.DictWriter()</samp> object, you’ll need to pass in this list of headers for your CSV file.</p>

<p class="TX">Next, the code opens the output CSV file for writing, this time calling it <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">output_f</samp>, and creates the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv.DictWriter()</samp> object, saving it in the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">writer</samp> variable. Finally, the program writes the header row to the CSV. To write the remaining rows, you’ll need to run <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">writer.writerow()</samp>, passing in a dictionary that represents the row.</p>

<p class="TX">Try running the script so far:</p>

<pre id="pre-415"><code>micah@trapdoor chapter-9 % <b>python3 exercise-9-3.py </b><b><var>/Volumes/datasets/</var></b><b>BlueLeaks-extracted sites</b>

<p class="TX">The script itself shouldn’t display any output; it should just create an output CSV file, <i>sites.csv</i>. Try displaying its contents using <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">cat</samp>:</p>

<p class="TNI">Now that you can write rows to your CSV, the next step is to loop through the BlueLeaks sites, looking for <i>Company.csv</i> files, using the following code:</p>

<pre id="pre-417"><code>import click

import csv

<b>import os</b>



@click.command()

@click.argument("blueleaks_path")

@click.argument("output_csv_path")

def main(blueleaks_path, output_csv_path):

    """Make a CSV that describes all the BlueLeaks folders"""

    headers = ["BlueLeaksFolder", "CompanyID", "CompanyName", "WebsiteTitle", "URL"]

    with open(output_csv_path, "w") as output_f:

        writer = csv.DictWriter(output_f, fieldnames=headers)

        writer.writeheader()



        <b>for folder_name in os.listdir(blueleaks_path):</b>

            <b>company_csv_path = os.path.join(blueleaks_path, folder_name, "Company.csv")</b>

            <b>if os.path.exists(company_csv_path):</b>

                <b>print(company_csv_path)</b>



if __name__ == "__main__":

    main()</code></pre>

<p class="TX">This code imports the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">os</samp> module. After creating the CSV writer, it loops through the return value of the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">os.listdir()</samp> function, which returns a list of all the files inside the BlueLeaks folder. It then defines a new <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">company_csv _path</samp> variable as the path to the <i>Company.csv</i> file inside that BlueLeaks <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_274" aria-label=" Page 274. "/>folder. Finally, the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">os.path.exists()</samp> function makes sure that this specific <i>Company.csv</i> file actually exists, and if so, the code displays its path.</p>

<p class="TX">Try running the code so far:</p>

<p class="TNI">The final step is to open all the <i>Company.csv</i> files whose paths you’ve just listed, loop through their rows, and add new rows to your output CSV file based on them:</p>

<pre id="pre-419"><code>import click

<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_275" aria-label=" Page 275.

It then creates a <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">csv.DictReader()</samp> object to read the data from this CSV and loops through its rows.</p>

<p class="TX">For each row, the code creates a new dictionary called <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">output_row</samp> that contains the name of the BlueLeaks folder you’re currently working in, as well as CompanyID, CompanyName, WebsiteTitle, and URL from <i>Company.csv</i>. It then uses the CSV writer you created in the previous section to save that row to your output CSV file. When the code finishes looping through all of the rows in a <i>Company.csv</i> file, it displays a message to show it’s done with that folder.</p>

<p class="TX">When you run this script, the output displays a line for each BlueLeaks folder showing that it has finished running. But more importantly, it creates the file <i>sites.csv</i>. <a href="#fig9-9">Figure 9-9</a> shows what that file looks like in LibreOffice Calc.</p>

<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_276" aria-label=" Page 276. "/>Once you’ve created the CSV, you can use your graphical spreadsheet software to freeze the header row at the top and sort the columns however you’d like. If you live in the US, try finding the fusion center that covers your region; that might be a good place to start digging. You can use the skills you’ve learned in this chapter and the Python scripts you’ve written to make the files for your chosen fusion center easier to work with.</p>

<p class="TX">Before you get too deep into your BlueLeaks investigations, though, I recommend reading <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a></span>, where I’ll introduce you to software that might save you time and allow you to uncover more interesting revelations.</p>

<p class="TNI">In this chapter, you started investigating CSV spreadsheets. You’ve learned how to open and examine them using spreadsheet software, as well as how to read and write them using Python code, sharpening your programming skills along the way. You’ve also learned more about the BlueLeaks dataset structure and how to find hidden details, such as who posted which SARs and what documents were sent out as part of which bulk email messages, in the spreadsheets.</p>

<p class="TX">You’ve explored just a few CSVs in BlueLeaks so far, including <i>SARs.csv</i> and <i>EmailBuilder.csv</i> in NCRIC and <i>Company.csv</i> in all of the folders, but there’s still much more to investigate. In the next chapter, you’ll learn how to research the BlueLeaks dataset in depth using my custom-built software, BlueLeaks Explorer.</p>

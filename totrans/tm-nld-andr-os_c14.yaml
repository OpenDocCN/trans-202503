    Those of us coming from Danger wanted to make another user interface toolkit based

    underneath and a robust service architecture on the other side of the network.
    The people coming from PalmSource wanted to do their activity lifecycle model
    and interprocess communication model again, but get it right this time. The people
    coming from Skia wanted to do QuickDraw GX again, but get it right this time.

- en: For the view invalidation performance work, Romain needed a new tool. “I wrote
    ‘hierarchyviewer’ because it was really hard to know what was getting invalidated.
    So I wrote this viewer that would show me the tree of views and blink them a different
    color when they were marked dirty, when they would draw, and when there was a
    `requestLayout()`.^([26](#c14-footnote-26)) As I was making optimizations, I could
    see what was happening. It would blink less!”

- en: ListView is a container that holds (wait for it . . . ) a list of items. The
    trick with this element in particular is that it is, by its very nature, incredibly
    performance-sensitive. Its only purpose is to contain tons of data (images and
    text) and to be able to scroll through the items quickly. The key is “quickly.”
    As items are coming onto the screen, the UI toolkit has to create, size, and place
    all of these new items, which then disappear as soon as they scroll off the other
    edge of the screen. It’s a lot of effort to do all of this, and on that early
    hardware the toolkit couldn’t keep up with it, so the user experience was . .
    . not great.

- en: When Romain inherited this widget from Mike Cleron, it was able to contain,
    render, and scroll items. But its performance was far from acceptable, so Romain
    put a huge amount of effort into optimizing it. Avoiding object and UI element
    creation was a general pattern of Android development at the time for performance
    reasons, and ListView was an easy place to see why that pattern evolved.

- en: Like others on the team, Romain jumped into many other projects on Android in
    those early days (and beyond). Besides his core UI toolkit responsibilities, he
    took over the launcher application from Mike (who had started to lead the framework
    team and had other responsibilities beyond code), and also helped out on the Email^([27](#c14-footnote-27))
    app when the contractor working on it left. Fortunately, Romain had relevant experience
    from his time as a tech journalist. “I had written articles on how to implement
    the IMAP protocol, so I was not completely out of my league. But that was on top
    of everything else that we were doing . . . which was a little much.”

  zh: 和团队中的其他成员一样，Romain在那些早期（以及之后）也参与了许多其他Android项目。除了核心的UI工具包职责外，他还接管了Mike负责的启动器应用（Mike开始领导框架团队并承担了除代码之外的其他职责），并且在负责Email^([27](#c14-footnote-27))应用的承包商离开后，他也提供了帮助。幸运的是，Romain有相关的技术记者经验。“我曾写过关于如何实现IMAP协议的文章，所以我并不完全不懂。但这又是在我们做的其他所有事情之上...这有点多。”
- en: He also helped out with other apps. Since the platform was new, a lot of functionality
    was developed in response to application requirements. Applications needed new
    features from the platform, so they worked with the platform team to implement
    them.

  zh: 他还帮助了其他应用程序。由于平台是新的，许多功能是为了响应应用需求而开发的。应用程序需要平台的新功能，因此他们与平台团队合作来实现这些功能。
- en: One of the ongoing efforts for the apps teams at that time was performance.
    “Serving their needs was important, but also having them understand the cost of
    things. That’s why hierarchyviewer came to be, because apps were creating way
    too many views. View hierarchies were way too expensive for our devices. That
    was a way to show them, ‘You can see this monster tree that you’ve created, and
    this is very expensive for us.’ Despite all of the optimizations we had, that
    was very expensive. So it was a way to help them figure out how to optimize their
    code. That’s how I also came up with the `merge` tag, the `include` tag, and the
    `viewstub`,^([28](#c14-footnote-28)) to help them achieve what they need, but
    also reclaim some of that performance.”

  zh: 当时应用团队的一个持续努力是性能。“满足他们的需求很重要，但同样重要的是让他们理解事物的成本。这就是为什么HierarchyViewer出现的原因，因为应用程序创建了太多的视图。视图层次结构对于我们的设备来说太昂贵了。这是一个向他们展示‘你们创建的这个庞大树形结构，给我们带来了很高的成本’的方式。尽管我们做了所有的优化，但这依然是非常昂贵的。所以它帮助他们了解如何优化代码。这也是我想出`merge`标签、`include`标签和`viewstub`标签的原因，^([28](#c14-footnote-28))帮助他们完成需求的同时，也能重新夺回一些性能。”

- en: After 1.0 shipped, there was still plenty of work to do to get the platform
    to the state the team originally envisioned. One of the projects that had begun
    early on but which wasn’t fully realized at 1.0 was support for different screen
    densities, which is described earlier in the Resources section of Chapter 13 (“Framework”).
    After 1.0, Romain took over the work begun earlier by Dianne and finished it off
    in time for the Eclair release,^([29](#c14-footnote-29)) in the Fall of 2009.

  zh: 在1.0版本发布后，仍然有很多工作要做，以便将平台发展到团队最初设想的状态。一个早期开始但在1.0时未完全实现的项目是对不同屏幕密度的支持，这在第13章（“框架”）的资源部分中有所描述。1.0之后，Romain接管了Dianne早期开始的工作，并在2009年秋季的Eclair版本发布时完成了它。^([29](#c14-footnote-29))
- en: Screen density has a direct impact on the quality of the images on that screen;
    a screen with higher density can represent more information in the same space,
    leading to sharper, better images. Higher-density screens have resulted in higher-quality
    phone and laptop displays over the last several years. Higher-density camera sensors
    have also led to higher-quality photos, as the megapixel count of images produced
    from those sensors has soared.^([30](#c14-footnote-30))

  zh: 屏幕密度直接影响该屏幕上图像的质量；高密度屏幕可以在相同的空间内呈现更多信息，从而产生更清晰、更好的图像。近年来，高密度屏幕导致了手机和笔记本显示器质量的提升。高密度的摄像头传感器也带来了更高质量的照片，因为这些传感器拍摄的图像的百万像素数大幅增加。^([30](#c14-footnote-30))
- en: The initial G1 device, and all other Android devices until the Droid, had a
    density of 160 pixels per inch (PPI), which meant that there were 160 distinct
    color values (vertically and horizontally) in every inch of screen real estate.
    The Droid had a density of 265 PPI. This higher density meant that more information
    could be represented, resulting in, say, smoother curved lines and text, or images
    with more detail. But developers needed a way to define their UIs to take advantage
    of these changes in density.
  id: totrans-72
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The system that Dianne, and then Romain, implemented allowed developers to define
    their UIs independent of the actual size of the pixels on a device, using the
    unit *dp* (*density-independent pixel*). The system would then scale these UIs
    appropriately based on the actual density of the device that the application was
    running on. This mechanism for handling screen density, along with related capabilities
    in the resource system for serving up different assets based on the density and
    the entire UI layout system for handling UI organization independent of screen
    sizes, were critical as Android matured. Android changed from a platform running
    on top of only one kind of device (the G1 and its follow-on devices at the same
    size and density) to a world full of all kinds of screen sizes and densities as
    manufacturers started to introduce vastly different formats for their customers.

- en: Many pieces make up what the team calls the UI toolkit, since it’s basically
    the visual side of the entire framework. What really defined the work for the
    team at that time (Joe, Mike, Eric, Romain, and others) was coming up with the
    toolkit APIs and core functionality, and then working on performance, performance,
    and performance.^([31](#c14-footnote-31)) The UI for Android is basically everything
    that the user sees, so performance for this front line of the platform is even
    more important, because problems there are so very noticeable. So the team kept
    optimizing things . . . and to some extent, still does.

<h2 class="h2" id="ch00"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent">Since the release of the BBC micro:bit in 2016, millions of these devices have been distributed. They’re enjoyed by both kids and adults all over the world. The micro:bit was designed as an easy way to teach kids programming skills. One of its great advantages is that you don’t need anything more than a USB cable and a computer to start using it. Also, once programmed, it can be disconnected from a power source and run on batteries.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xx"/>The micro:bit has a small LED display as well as sensors for light, movement, and magnetic fields, so it has everything you need to make interesting projects. When you’re ready, you can easily connect things like motors, sensors, and loudspeakers using alligator clips—there’s no need for soldering. In other words, your micro:bit can be the <em>brain</em> for lots of projects and inventions.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec1"><strong>ABOUT THIS BOOK</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">In these pages, you’ll find a variety of experiments and projects. The experiments show you how things work, and then in the projects, you’ll use that knowledge to make something funky.</p>
<p class="indent">The book is divided into 10 chapters. <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1</a> tells you all you need to know about connecting and using your micro:bit. You’ll use this information in all the experiments and projects in this book. Each of the following chapters deals with a specific topic, such as light, sound, and movement. There are lots of fun and useful things you can do with your micro:bit!</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec4"><strong>CODE AND RESOURCES</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The two most popular computer languages for programming the micro:bit are Makecode Blocks (referred to as just <em>Blocks</em> in this book) and the MicroPython programming language.</p>
<p class="indent">Wherever possible, I’ve provided programs for the projects and experiments in both Blocks and MicroPython. This means you don’t have to type in the code yourself—unless you want to.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxiii"/>You can find all the code for the activities in this book at the companion GitHub page: <em><a href="https://github.com/simonmonk/mbms/">https://github.com/simonmonk/mbms/</a></em>. I provide full instructions for accessing and using the code in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1</a>.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxiv"/></p>

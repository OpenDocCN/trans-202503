    exercise. This chapter puts you in the role of facilitator and covers a number
    of strategies that will help ensure your event is productive. Some of these are
    guidelines you can follow to stay organized and balance your responsibilities
    as facilitator, and others are recommendations for tools and techniques to boost
    participant engagement and create a more interactive exercise.

    worth of logs would be available. If the facilitator hadn’t followed up on the
    network administrator’s initial answer, the exercise would have missed these important
    findings. However, you should avoid challenging every statement even if you are
    highly skilled in certain topics—you don’t want to create an adversarial environment

    eliminate one of your tasks: tracking the issues, deficiencies, and recommendations
    that will eventually find their way into the post-tabletop report. You can assign
    these tasks to what is commonly referred to as a *scribe*. This person doesn’t
    need to be an expert in information security or a related field; they just need
    to be familiar with the scenario so they can understand the exercise’s context,

    a lighter schedule than most employees and could use the experience to learn about
    organizational dynamics and cybersecurity. Alternatively, the scribe could be
    someone in a mid-level function with a vested interest in the tabletop exercise’s
    outcome. For example, a risk management professional would likely benefit from
    viewing the incident response process and understanding the issues that emerge.

    This person can take on tasks like scanning the audience for questions or managing
    the presentation software. By agreeing to divide and conquer tasks in advance,
    you’ll each have fewer responsibilities. Also, one of you can take mental breaks

    lines of questioning, and take a moment to mentally recharge.

    specific facts in an inject. For example, if an inject for a senior-level tabletop
    communicates a new set of facts from the IT security team (such as the confirmed
    loss of sensitive data), the actual IT security manager could enter the room to
    brief the attendees.
  id: totrans-43
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A guest presenter should present facts just as they would in a real incident.
    For example, the IT security manager could use the opportunity to practice announcing
    newly confirmed technical information. In addition to making the tabletop exercise
    more interactive, using a guest presenter has the benefit of acquainting participants
    with someone who would be involved in the response to a real information security
    incident. However, be sure to brief the guest presenter on anything they shouldn’t
    say to keep them from spoiling unknowns or contradicting scenario details.

  id: totrans-45

    ready to ask participants. This is yet another way that you can better manage
    the litany of facilitation tasks during the exercise.
  id: totrans-46
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In some tabletop exercises, attendees participate readily, and you might have
    trouble keeping track of the many valuable points they bring up. Having questions
    readily available for each inject can save you from trying to remember whether
    a fruitful discussion addressed all the important points. Alternatively, the audience
    may give short answers and engage minimally, leaving you struggling to find ways
    to spark the conversation. During such situations, having prewritten questions
    can help you jump-start stalled discussions.
  id: totrans-47
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Prewritten questions could be tied to a particular inject, or they could be
    generic and asked at any time. Make sure, however, that they align with the goals
    of the exercise and are appropriate for the participants. For example, if you
    aim to determine whether the organization has the proper tooling to detect and
    contain a cybersecurity incident, your questions probably shouldn’t focus on how
    to notify and update executive leadership of a breach.
  id: totrans-48
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should understand the correct answers to the questions you ask, ideally
    based on formal documentation. For example, if one of your questions involves
    log retention, you should be aware of a company policy requiring that select logs
    be maintained for 90 days. The point of asking questions you already know the
    answer to isn’t to pounce on a wrong answer; rather, it’s to help you craft pertinent
    follow-up questions and enhance your knowledge of the topic.
  id: totrans-49
  prefs: []

    Exercise Tools and Tactics'

    ranging from a simple whiteboard and easel to live, online polling software. Of
    course, the fact that a new shiny tool exists doesn’t mean that it would be appropriate
    for the audience or enhance the exercise—or that you’ll know how to use it. You
    must be skilled at using any aids you bring along. A live tabletop exercise is
    not the time to troubleshoot a new technology or determine that you haven’t enabled
    the correct setting (and doing so is a surefire way to earn a collective facepalm
    from your audience).

    software or store tabletop data on a company laptop or tablet? Some highly regulated
    environments prohibit the use of tools like remote presentation platforms, so
    it’s essential to understand any constraints in advance.*'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You or your scribe could use a writing board (such as a whiteboard, paper flipchart,
    or chalkboard) to record points as they emerge. This is particularly helpful when
    participants repeat an issue in a discussion; you can politely point to the writing
    board and remind them that it has already been discussed and recorded.
  id: totrans-61
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A writing board can also serve as a “parking lot” for questions or concerns
    that need to be explored. Attendees sometimes fire off a battery of questions,
    and writing those items on the board “parks” them until you’re ready to explore
    them. This keeps you in control of the discussion’s flow while assuring attendees
    that their issue won’t be forgotten.
  id: totrans-62
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If no writing board is available in the conference room, you could purchase
    an easel and flipchart to bring to the event. As previously discussed, make sure
    you’re aware of the features and shortcomings of the room before the time of your
    exercise.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One strategy to increase participation in a tabletop exercise you’re facilitating
    is to add interactive elements. For example, using polling software can be an
    excellent way to elicit audience interaction. Polling software lets you present
    a question to participants, who can answer using a smartphone, tablet, or laptop.
    As the participants answer, the responses might appear in real time, after a predetermined
    period, or when you end the submission period.
  id: totrans-65
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Polling software does require some additional coordination, and most polling
    software platforms have a nominal fee; however, they’re easy to use. Some online
    presentation platforms have built-in polling capabilities, eliminating the need
    for an add-on service.

  id: totrans-67

    process, you could display a poll question asking whether a certain set of conditions
    would require notifying information security personnel. This could demonstrate
    whether attendees are taking the appropriate actions.

    set of facts. For example, [Figure 4-1](#fig4-1) shows a poll question for an
    inject that asks, “Based on the known facts, would the following scenario be considered
    a cybersecurity incident?” The audience can visit the given URL to submit their

    more than a yes or no answer. For example, if you’re exploring who participants
    believe has the authority to take certain containment actions, such as shutting
    down key network segments or disconnecting the internet, forcing them to fill
    in an answer box on a survey may provide interesting results. As you can see in
    [Figure 4-3](#fig4-3), responses to a poll question mostly coalesced around two
    names (Jennifer and Taylor) but included a few others. Such a result may indicate
    that the organization needs to better define who is authorized to take specific,
    potentially drastic actions.

    contact about topics to avoid. Keep in mind that there is a difference between
    asking tough questions and asking questions that betray a lack of awareness or
    sensitivity. When in doubt, however, consider avoiding a certain discussion point.

    exercise. This chapter puts you in the role of facilitator and covers a number
    of strategies that will help ensure your event is productive. Some of these are
    guidelines you can follow to stay organized and balance your responsibilities
    as facilitator, and others are recommendations for tools and techniques to boost
    participant engagement and create a more interactive exercise.

    participants to discuss the scenario and intervene only when necessary.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This means, first, that you must avoid dominating the conversation. As a rule
    of thumb, you should aim to speak no more than 30 percent of the time. Some facilitators
    mistakenly think they must control all aspects of the conversation; unfortunately,
    this discourages collaboration between attendees and fosters an environment where
    issues are less likely to emerge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should also avoid “leading the witness” by overly managing the discussion.
    While attendees might sometimes need to be nudged in a particular direction, it
    is far more effective for you to ask questions that enable attendees to explore
    the topic on their own. This process fosters a more robust dialogue.
  prefs: []

    validity. Consider the following example:'

    the system?'

    issues: (1) there was no documented log retention standard, and (2) with the current
    log retention scheme and a very active server, it’s possible that only a few days’
    worth of logs would be available. If the facilitator hadn’t followed up on the
    network administrator’s initial answer, the exercise would have missed these important
    findings. However, you should avoid challenging every statement even if you are
    highly skilled in certain topics—you don’t want to create an adversarial environment
    or come across as a know-it-all.'

    even when an attendee says something that borders on outright incompetence (and

    process attendee input and questions, scan the group for visual cues, keep the
    focus on the scenario, ensure that key points get addressed, maintain a tactful
    and attentive dialogue, defer to positions of authority in the room, and note
    any process deficiencies to be addressed in a follow-up report.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    The facilitation management tasks discussed in this section can help you reduce
    fatigue and focus on the discussion.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Assigning a Scribe
  prefs:
  - PREF_H4
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'One of the simplest methods of reducing your burden as facilitator is to completely
    eliminate one of your tasks: tracking the issues, deficiencies, and recommendations
    that will eventually find their way into the post-tabletop report. You can assign
    these tasks to what is commonly referred to as a *scribe*. This person doesn’t
    need to be an expert in information security or a related field; they just need
    to be familiar with the scenario so they can understand the exercise’s context,
    goals, objectives, and the role of the participants.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The role of the scribe can easily be filled by a junior employee who might have
    a lighter schedule than most employees and could use the experience to learn about
    organizational dynamics and cybersecurity. Alternatively, the scribe could be
    someone in a mid-level function with a vested interest in the tabletop exercise’s
    outcome. For example, a risk management professional would likely benefit from
    viewing the incident response process and understanding the issues that emerge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The scribe must coordinate with you before the tabletop exercise to understand
    in advance what to track. While you’re facilitating the event, you should also
    have a discreet way of signaling (a glance or other nonverbal gesture, for example)
    when the scribe should record an important point.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to taking notes, the scribe could create an initial draft of the
    report for you to review. We discuss reporting in [Chapter 5](chapter5.xhtml).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '#### Adding a Co-facilitator'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another way to ease the burden of facilitation is to recruit a co-facilitator.
    This person can take on tasks like scanning the audience for questions or managing
    the presentation software. By agreeing to divide and conquer tasks in advance,
    you’ll each have fewer responsibilities. Also, one of you can take mental breaks
    while the other addresses a line of questioning. This gives you both opportunities
    to briefly reflect on the status of the tabletop exercise, contemplate future
    lines of questioning, and take a moment to mentally recharge.
  prefs: []

    comes in many forms, including:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Personality** Co-facilitating a tabletop requires close collaboration during
    all phases of the exercise. Choose someone with whom you can enjoy a cup of coffee
    (and not someone with whom you find yourself constantly checking your phone for
    an excuse to depart). You don’t need to be best friends; however, facilitators
    should have a degree of workplace chemistry.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Facilitation styles** Some facilitators have an aggressive delivery style,
    while others are more passive. Avoid mixing facilitator styles, which could give
    attendees whiplash as they adjust between questions from each facilitator. A tabletop
    exercise shouldn’t make the attendees feel like they’re in a game of good cop/bad
    cop.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_BQ
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition, having a co-facilitator can bring in different viewpoints and subject
    matter expertise. While one of you may be an expert in risk management, the other
    might be skilled in network security. These complementary skill sets could add
    more value to the exercise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Inviting a Guest Presenter
  prefs:
  - PREF_H4
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To break up your facilitator role, you could invite a guest presenter to introduce
    specific facts in an inject. For example, if an inject for a senior-level tabletop
    communicates a new set of facts from the IT security team (such as the confirmed
    loss of sensitive data), the actual IT security manager could enter the room to
    brief the attendees.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A guest presenter should present facts just as they would in a real incident.
    For example, the IT security manager could use the opportunity to practice announcing
    newly confirmed technical information. In addition to making the tabletop exercise
    more interactive, using a guest presenter has the benefit of acquainting participants
    with someone who would be involved in the response to a real information security
    incident. However, be sure to brief the guest presenter on anything they shouldn’t
    say to keep them from spoiling unknowns or contradicting scenario details.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '#### Prewriting Questions'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A common facilitation technique is to enter the event with several questions
    ready to ask participants. This is yet another way that you can better manage
    the litany of facilitation tasks during the exercise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In some tabletop exercises, attendees participate readily, and you might have
    trouble keeping track of the many valuable points they bring up. Having questions
    readily available for each inject can save you from trying to remember whether
    a fruitful discussion addressed all the important points. Alternatively, the audience
    may give short answers and engage minimally, leaving you struggling to find ways
    to spark the conversation. During such situations, having prewritten questions
    can help you jump-start stalled discussions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Prewritten questions could be tied to a particular inject, or they could be
    generic and asked at any time. Make sure, however, that they align with the goals
    of the exercise and are appropriate for the participants. For example, if you
    aim to determine whether the organization has the proper tooling to detect and
    contain a cybersecurity incident, your questions probably shouldn’t focus on how
    to notify and update executive leadership of a breach.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should understand the correct answers to the questions you ask, ideally
    based on formal documentation. For example, if one of your questions involves
    log retention, you should be aware of a company policy requiring that select logs
    be maintained for 90 days. The point of asking questions you already know the
    answer to isn’t to pounce on a wrong answer; rather, it’s to help you craft pertinent
    follow-up questions and enhance your knowledge of the topic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'You might want to work with the trusted agent on this task, as they’ll likely
    understand the questions worth asking as well as their correct answers. Examples
    of prewritten questions include:'

  prefs:

    correct answer (or at least superficial guidance).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Finally, prewritten questions are an effective crutch if you feel nervous at
    the prospect of facilitating a tabletop exercise. While managing the numerous
    other exercise management tasks, you may find yourself stuck during a lull in
    conversation; having a question ready to go can be a godsend in that situation.  ###
    Exercise Tools and Tactics'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a variety of tools at your disposal to assist with the tabletop exercise,
    ranging from a simple whiteboard and easel to live, online polling software. Of
    course, the fact that a new shiny tool exists doesn’t mean that it would be appropriate
    for the audience or enhance the exercise—or that you’ll know how to use it. You
    must be skilled at using any aids you bring along. A live tabletop exercise is
    not the time to troubleshoot a new technology or determine that you haven’t enabled
    the correct setting (and doing so is a surefire way to earn a collective facepalm
    from your audience).
  prefs: []

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    you in facilitating the exercise. Prior to doing so, make sure the technology
    is allowed. For example, does policy or business practice permit you to load certain
    software or store tabletop data on a company laptop or tablet? Some highly regulated
    environments prohibit the use of tools like remote presentation platforms, so
    it’s essential to understand any constraints in advance.*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A Writing Board
  prefs:
  - PREF_H4
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You or your scribe could use a writing board (such as a whiteboard, paper flipchart,
    or chalkboard) to record points as they emerge. This is particularly helpful when
    participants repeat an issue in a discussion; you can politely point to the writing
    board and remind them that it has already been discussed and recorded.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A writing board can also serve as a “parking lot” for questions or concerns
    that need to be explored. Attendees sometimes fire off a battery of questions,
    and writing those items on the board “parks” them until you’re ready to explore
    them. This keeps you in control of the discussion’s flow while assuring attendees
    that their issue won’t be forgotten.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If no writing board is available in the conference room, you could purchase
    an easel and flipchart to bring to the event. As previously discussed, make sure
    you’re aware of the features and shortcomings of the room before the time of your
    exercise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Polling Software
  prefs:
  - PREF_H4
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One strategy to increase participation in a tabletop exercise you’re facilitating
    is to add interactive elements. For example, using polling software can be an
    excellent way to elicit audience interaction. Polling software lets you present
    a question to participants, who can answer using a smartphone, tablet, or laptop.
    As the participants answer, the responses might appear in real time, after a predetermined
    period, or when you end the submission period.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Polling software does require some additional coordination, and most polling
    software platforms have a nominal fee; however, they’re easy to use. Some online
    presentation platforms have built-in polling capabilities, eliminating the need
    for an add-on service.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Consider the following examples where polling software may be helpful:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: During an exercise intended to assess whether attendees are following the correct
    process, you could display a poll question asking whether a certain set of conditions
    would require notifying information security personnel. This could demonstrate
    whether attendees are taking the appropriate actions.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By providing a question with a free-form answer, you could verify whether attendees
    respond with different and conflicting responses. This would demonstrate a lack
    of alignment on processes and the need for education.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Recording poll questions during a tabletop exercise may help satisfy an audit
    requirement and function as evidence of participation.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A simple way to use polling software is to ask a question after presenting a
    set of facts. For example, [Figure 4-1](#fig4-1) shows a poll question for an
    inject that asks, “Based on the known facts, would the following scenario be considered
    a cybersecurity incident?” The audience can visit the given URL to submit their
    answers.

    more than a yes or no answer. For example, if you’re exploring who participants
    believe has the authority to take certain containment actions, such as shutting
    down key network segments or disconnecting the internet, forcing them to fill
    in an answer box on a survey may provide interesting results. As you can see in
    [Figure 4-3](#fig4-3), responses to a poll question mostly coalesced around two
    names (Jennifer and Taylor) but included a few others. Such a result may indicate
    that the organization needs to better define who is authorized to take specific,
    potentially drastic actions.

    capture data points that you can use for reporting. Automatically recording these
    answers saves time and can provide details that support your recommendations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As helpful as they can be, don’t use polls arbitrarily; they should always be
    oriented toward a particular issue.
  prefs: []

    exercise is not the time to discover that you need to adjust a default configuration.

    be split up. In these situations, it’s generally a good idea to stand opposite
    the displayed presentation (option 2 in [Figure 4-4](#fig4-4)) so that attendees
    can split their attention between the front of the room (where the presentation
    is displayed) and the back (where you are), ensuring that there isn’t a single
    focal point. This type of setup also encourages more interaction among attendees.

    key information to each other outside the audience’s watchful eyes.

    where they can consist of a side chat room. During an in-person exercise, a backchannel
    is more difficult to implement but not impossible; the trusted agent can send
    you a short message on a strategically positioned cell phone. However, you must
    be careful not to let that distract you from your other facilitation tasks or
    make it obvious that you are communicating with someone else in the room, which
    could be awkward in some situations.

    failure), the trusted agent can request that the topic be addressed. Alternatively,
    the backchannel could provide an opportunity to connect with an executive sponsor,
    ask them how the exercise is going, and make adjustments as necessary.

    saying, “I just wanted to make sure this is meeting your expectations. Is there
    anything we should explore further or be sure to address?” This gives the senior

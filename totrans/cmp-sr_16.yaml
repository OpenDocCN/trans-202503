- en: Some tasks you do with a computer, such as printing and scanning, require an
    extra device. You’ll need to connect this device to your computer to let them
    communicate and work together. Most modern printers, scanners, webcams, and other
    devices connect via a USB connection. With Windows 10, you can just plug in these
    devices and they’re ready to go. However, you sometimes need to install a device
    so your computer can recognize it and what it does. We’ll cover both scenarios
    here. Fortunately, the processes for installing different devices are very similar
    and fairly simple. However, if you do run into any trouble, make sure you consult
    your device’s quick start guide—usually a pamphlet that comes with your device—for
    more details.

    other end of the power cord should plug into a matching port somewhere on your
    device—most likely the back or bottom. Again, check the instructions for the device
    if you aren’t sure.

    pop up briefly in the bottom-right corner of your screen, such as the one shown

- en: After you’ve connected your device, you need to help your computer recognize
    the device so they can communicate. To do this, you might need to install a *driver*,
    which is a simple type of software that lets the computer and the device speak
    the same language.

- en: 'Fortunately, Windows automatically installs drivers for most devices as soon
    as you connect them to your computer, in which case you don’t have to do anything.
    However, if Windows can’t find the correct driver, you might need to find and
    add the driver yourself using a CD that came with the device. To check whether
    Windows has found the correct driver, try using your new device. If the device
    works, then it means Windows has found and installed the driver and you won’t
    need to! If the device doesn’t work, follow these steps to find and add the driver:'

    very few educational apps provide young children with opportunities to design,

- en: ScratchJr is an introductory programming language that encourages creativity
    and expression, enabling five- to seven-year-old children to create their own
    interactive projects through *coding* , as it is often called these days.

- en: Using ScratchJr, children can snap together programming blocks to make characters
    move, jump, dance, and sing. They can modify how their characters look, design
    their own backgrounds, add their own voices and sounds and even photos of themselves—and
    then use the programming blocks to bring their characters to life.

    millions of young people (ages eight and up) around the world. We redesigned the
    interface and programming language to make it developmentally appropriate, as
    well as fun and engaging, for younger children.

    code. Coding is often seen as difficult or exclusive, but we see it as a new type
    of literacy—a skill that should be accessible for everyone. Coding helps learners
    to organize their thinking and express their ideas, just as writing does.

    themselves with the computer, rather than just interact with software created
    by others. Children learn to think sequentially, explore cause and effect, and
    develop design and problem-solving skills. At the same time, they learn to use
    math and language in a meaningful and motivating context.

    can enjoy it too, and it can also be useful for introducing older children to
    coding before they move on to other programming languages (like Scratch).

    can create with ScratchJr. [Chapter 2](text00008.html#ch02) shows playful animations,

    to think creatively and reason systematically. It was written particularly for
    people without coding experience or technical expertise, but it can also be helpful
    for those who do have expertise but don’t have experience working with young children.

    to other programming languages. With a little additional support, younger children
    can enjoy it too, and it can also be useful for introducing older children to
    coding before they move on to other programming languages (like Scratch).

- en: And, of course, for parents or educators without any coding knowledge, this
    book is a good way to learn the basics of coding. The best way to learn something
    new is to teach it to someone else. So as you help young children learn to code,
    you’ll be learning too.

    some initial activities to familiarize you with the basic features of ScratchJr.
    The rest of the book assumes you can make your way around ScratchJr, so don’t
    skip the first chapter! The remaining chapters describe projects that young children
    can create with ScratchJr. [Chapter 2](text00008.html#ch02) shows playful animations,
    [Chapter 3](text00009.html#ch03) shows how to tell interactive stories, and [Chapter
    4](text00010.html#ch04) shows how to create fun games.

    don’t feel as though you need to follow this book step-by-step. Feel free to mix
    and match and adapt our suggested projects to your own and your child’s interests.
    Follow your child’s lead. Every detour is a child-directed learning experience.
    ScratchJr is a tool for self-expression. Children should feel free to explore
    ScratchJr’s many buttons and features and to use characters and backgrounds that
    are meaningful to them. This is something we hear frequently from parents and

    millions of young people (ages eight and up) around the world. We redesigned the
    interface and programming language to make it developmentally appropriate, as
    well as fun and engaging, for younger children.

    don’t feel as though you need to follow this book step-by-step. Feel free to mix

    Follow your child’s lead. Every detour is a child-directed learning experience.
    ScratchJr is a tool for self-expression. Children should feel free to explore
    ScratchJr’s many buttons and features and to use characters and backgrounds that
    are meaningful to them. This is something we hear frequently from parents and

    to think creatively and reason systematically. It was written particularly for
    people without coding experience or technical expertise, but it can also be helpful
    for those who do have expertise but don’t have experience working with young children.

    to other programming languages. With a little additional support, younger children
    can enjoy it too, and it can also be useful for introducing older children to
    coding before they move on to other programming languages (like Scratch).

    book is a good way to learn the basics of coding. The best way to learn something
    new is to teach it to someone else. So as you help young children learn to code,
    you’ll be learning too.

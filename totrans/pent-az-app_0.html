<div class="image"><img src="../images/00015.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre3"/></div>
<p class="noindent">Planning, kickoff meetings, contracts. A bit mundane, right? I can think of no penetration tester who prefers the paperwork part of the job to the hacking portion. That said, some preparation work is required to pull off a successful test and not end up in a world of trouble. Without proper planning and notifications, your penetration testing could violate laws or legal agreements, potentially ending your infosec career. I promise, a small amount of pre-work can be completed quickly and will result in a better-quality penetration test that will cement your place among the top tier of security professionals—so read on, friend!</p>
<p class="indent">This chapter focuses on the steps needed to properly design and launch a cloud-focused penetration test. We’ll begin by considering what to include in the project scope and why scoping is even more important than usual when a cloud service, such as Azure, is involved. From there, we’ll move on to obtaining permission and some important rules to follow.</p>
<h3 class="h1" id="lev5"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_2" class="calibre1"/><strong class="calibre2">A Hybrid Approach</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">With more and more corporations placing parts of their IT infrastructure in the cloud, it has become hard to differentiate internal applications from public-facing services. As a professional penetration tester working in a cloud-focused company, I’ve seen a number of requests to assess a new cloud deployment. Whenever I see such a request, I always push to increase the scope of the test to cover both the cloud portion and any related on-premises components, including non-cloud-based data stores, user accounts for employees working on the cloud projects, employee workstations, and test environments.</p>
<p class="indent">The number of findings I have at the end of a project seems to grow exponentially when I am permitted to look at a group’s internal, external, and cloud-based assets—for a few reasons.</p>
<h4 class="h2" id="lev6"><strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre10">Teams Don’t Always Have Cloud Experience</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">For many IT professionals and software engineers, the cloud is a whole new world. Sure, a lot of services look and seem similar to what used to run inside of the corporation, but many behave slightly differently from what users have grown accustomed to. When these differences are ignored or misunderstood, it can lead to vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.</p>
<p class="indent">Additionally, the most common security architecture in the 1990s and 2000s was to place everything on a trusted internal network and then put all the security around the perimeter. This layout looked a lot like a castle of old—and just like the castle, changing technology has rendered it obsolete. Perimeter security doesn’t work when half your services are sitting on shared servers connected to the internet.</p>
<p class="indent">Designing security for a cloud environment is possible but requires planning, foresight, and experience that many engineers don’t yet have. Absent this knowledge, it is common to run into all kinds of poorly conceived cloud deployments.</p>
<h4 class="h2" id="lev7"><strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre10">Clouds Are Reasonably Secure by Default</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">This may seem a bit strange to read in a book about pentesting cloud services, but it is true: clouds are reasonably secure by default. When a customer goes to a cloud service provider’s portal and clicks through the steps to create a virtual machine (VM), the resulting system is usually locked down. Providers have base images that have firewalls turned on, antivirus pre-installed, and only one administrator present. As a penetration tester, this means that if you’re told to limit your scope to one cloud-hosted server, and you can’t include anything else in the test, you’re likely to fail. It isn’t until you expand the scope that things get interesting.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, perhaps the administrator of that VM reuses their password all over the place. Maybe they’d click a phishing email. My personal favorite is when an administrator leaves the password they use to connect <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_3"/>to the cloud platform sitting in a text file on a network share. The problem is, if the scope is limited to just that cloud VM, you can’t test any of these things. An assessment with this kind of limited scope will give those requesting the test the wrong impression that their cloud assets are impenetrable. In reality, a black hat (malicious) attacker would use any of these methods to gain the desired access.</p>
<h4 class="h2" id="lev8"><strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre10">It’s All Connected</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">As John Donne reminded us, “No man is an island.” In other words, all of humanity is interconnected. So too are our corporate networks, cloud services, and the internet. Frequently in my testing, I will use a foothold on a corporate workstation to gain access to a cloud service. Once into the cloud service, I’ll find something that gives me access to some other corporate resource I was previously unaware of or unable to crack. Use these links to your advantage; a real attacker wouldn’t hesitate to do so.</p>
<h3 class="h1" id="lev9"><strong class="calibre2">Getting Permission</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Once the scope of the assessment has been established, the next step is to obtain the required permission. After all, without permission, a penetration test could be considered black hat hacking. I don’t want you to be sued or fired or go to jail! Therefore, it is important to follow the steps discussed in this section.</p>
<h4 class="h2" id="lev10"><strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre10">Scope the Assessment</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Establishing a thorough <em class="calibre7">scope</em> that defines exactly which systems will be targeted, which methods will be used, and when the assessment will take place, and having it approved by all parties, is crucial to any penetration test. This is important during a conventional, on-premises assessment because you probably don’t want to waste time targeting a bunch of servers that are being decommissioned at the end of the week, nor do you want to take down that one production server with known issues that are being remediated.</p>
<p class="indent">That said, scoping a penetration test with a cloud component is <em class="calibre7">significantly</em> more important. Whereas when working on a corporate network you are likely to be (directly) impacting only your target organization, in the cloud a poorly planned scope could result in an attack against a different customer of the same cloud service provider or even the provider itself! Imagine finding out that the internet protocol (IP) address you thought belonged to your company’s Azure subscription was actually being used by the state department of a foreign nation—and you just found and exploited a vulnerability in one of their systems. That sounds like the beginning of an international incident I would desperately want to avoid.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_4"/>For that reason, I suggest forgoing <em class="calibre7">black box testing</em> (where the tester has very limited or no knowledge of the targets at the beginning of the test). Instead, insist on a more open approach where you are given at least the following:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="noindent1">Target subscription identifier(s)</li>
<li class="noindent1">Any IPs or hostnames of the services you are to target</li>
<li class="noindent1">A list of service types in the subscription and to which IPs they map</li>
<li class="noindent1">The goals and desired outcome of the engagement</li>
</ul>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="notes">WARNING</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em class="calibre7">Some services will have IP addresses dedicated to just your target, but others may be shared among multiple customers on the same infrastructure. Doing a broad scan against one of these IPs would be a definite rule violation.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Another important consideration when developing your scope is organizational policy. For external testers, this includes the rules of both your firm and the target organization. A number of large companies have internal procedures that dictate what is out of bounds in security testing (and sometimes, what <em class="calibre7">must</em> be included). Violating these mandates can end your employment, or worse. If you identify a method or service that is forbidden but that you feel is crucial to an accurate assessment, be sure to bring up your concerns with management, corporate attorneys, and the policy authors. You may end up with an exemption; at worst, you can document and explain the omission in your final report.</p>
<h4 class="h2" id="lev11"><strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre10">Notify Microsoft</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Once the scope is complete, you may need permission from the cloud provider—in our case, Microsoft. Each provider has its own set of rules that restrict the types of penetration testing permitted and what notification needs to be given, if any. Microsoft is actually pretty permissive in terms of the types of penetration testing it allows customers to perform against their own subscriptions’ resources, but it does appreciate advance notice. This is another reason why black box testing isn’t practical in the cloud: the Azure penetration test notification form asks for details of the assessment that wouldn’t be known ahead of time in a black box test.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="notes">WARNING</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em class="calibre7">The cloud provider’s rules and requirements are subject to change at any time. Always check the provider’s website for the latest policies.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">As of this writing, submitting the notification form and receiving confirmation from Microsoft is suggested, though not required. Scans using a commercial vulnerability scanner such as Qualys’s Vulnerability Management or Tenable’s Nessus don’t need any formal announcement. Additionally, you can forgo the form if you are just scanning for the Open Web Application Security Project’s (OWASP) top-ten web vulnerabilities, doing fuzzing, or port-scanning a few resources. For all other testing, it is best to submit notice.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_5"/>To submit a notification form, visit <em class="calibre7"><a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/engage/pentest" class="calibre6">https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/engage/pentest</a></em> and provide the following information:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="noindent1">Email account used to log in to Azure</li>
<li class="noindent1">Subscription ID</li>
<li class="noindent1">Contact information</li>
<li class="noindent1">Test start and end dates</li>
<li class="noindent1">Test description</li>
<li class="noindent1">An acknowledgment of the terms and conditions</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent"><a href="part0010.html#ch01fig1" class="calibre6">Figure 1-1</a> shows an example of this form. Note that a penetration test period can be at most six months in length. For longer tests, the form will need to be resubmitted.</p>
<div class="image1"><a id="ch01fig1" class="calibre6"/><img src="../images/00016.jpeg" alt="image" class="calibre3"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em class="calibre7">Figure 1-1: The Azure penetration test notification form</em></p>
<p class="indent">The form also requires you to acknowledge and accept the testing terms and conditions. Microsoft publishes a list of Azure penetration testing rules at <em class="calibre7"><a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/engage/pentest#pentestterms" class="calibre6">https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/engage/pentest#pentestterms</a></em>. Here are a few key takeaways from these rules:</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong class="calibre4">Test only subscriptions you have explicit permission to test.</strong></p>
<p class="indenta">Testing will be approved only for subscriptions that you or your company own, or those that you have explicit permission from the owner to test. This rule is easy to follow. Just be sure to have a solid scoping agreement, send the scope of the test to the Azure security team using the form, and then follow it!</p>
<p class="noindentt"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_6"/><strong class="calibre4">Perform only the testing you described in the form.</strong></p>
<p class="indenta">It can often be tempting during an assessment to start pulling new resources into scope as you discover systems or services you didn’t know about previously (this is commonly referred to as <em class="calibre7">scope creep</em>). However, that will get you into trouble if you don’t submit an updated notification form. Similarly, don’t start hammering away with a new tool you just found; provide notification first.</p>
<p class="noindentt"><strong class="calibre4">Do not target Microsoft services or those of other customers.</strong></p>
<p class="indenta">You were very precise when writing the scoping document and only included your target’s assets, right? If so, this shouldn’t be an issue. Just remember that resources are a bit fluid in the cloud: servers may be shared and IPs can change. When in doubt, confirm a target is owned by your employer before proceeding, and double-check that you received acknowledgment from Microsoft.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong class="calibre2"><span class="notes">WARNING</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em class="calibre7">For Platform as a Service (PaaS) resources, such as Azure Web Apps, the underlying server may be hosting websites for multiple customers, and these are therefore off limits for host-based attacks. This is what makes scoping in the cloud so much more complicated than in on-premises environments.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="noindentt"><strong class="calibre4">If you find a flaw in Azure itself, report it to Microsoft.</strong></p>
<p class="indenta">Microsoft is fairly strict with this last point—you are required to report any identified Azure Fabric vulnerabilities within 24 hours and must not disclose them elsewhere for 90 days. There is a bright side, though: you may be able to submit these findings to the Microsoft Online Services Bug Bounty program (as long as they meet that program’s requirements). Finding such a bug means a bit of additional work, but it can also mean a decent payout, plus public recognition from Microsoft. To find out more about the Bug Bounty program, see <em class="calibre7"><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dn800983/" class="calibre6">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dn800983/</a>.</em></p>
<h4 class="h2" id="lev12"><strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre10">Obtain a “Get Out of Jail Free” Card</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Borrowing a term from the board game <em class="calibre7">Monopoly</em>, a <em class="calibre7">Get Out of Jail Free card</em> is a document that proves you have permission to perform the actions involved in a penetration test. The letter should clearly state who the testers are, the scope of the activities you are authorized to perform, and the start and end dates of the test. It should be signed by the penetration test lead, a high-level manager at the company being assessed, and, if the penetration tester is external to that organization, a manager at the firm performing the test. Ideally, the letter should also contain some means to validate that it is legitimate and not forged, such as contact information for the managers. (I’ve heard of some testers actually carrying both forged and legitimate letters, to make sure there are procedures in place to validate what a potential attacker is saying.)</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_7"/>The letter can be used by the penetration tester if approached by corporate security officers or members of a blue team who question the attacker. It could also be shown to law enforcement officers if needed, though don’t be confused by the name—if you are being detained, it is unlikely that the police would release you simply because you have such a form. Although these letters are most useful when an assessment of physical security is being performed, I like to have one even when a physical evaluation is not in scope for a test. It provides proof that the actions I’m taking are authorized, so even if a meteor tragically crushes my management chain while they are at an offsite meeting, I can show that my hacks last week weren’t malicious.</p>
<p class="indent">If you are looking for a letter to use as a template, penetration tester extraordinaire and SANS Faculty Fellow Ed Skoudis has one on his website at <em class="calibre7"><a href="http://www.counterhack.net/permission_memo.html" class="calibre6">http://www.counterhack.net/permission_memo.html</a></em>. Ed also offers this excellent advice to his students: have your lawyer review your letter (as well as any contracts and other agreements related to penetration testing). What works for one organization in one location might not work for you. If you are a corporate penetration tester, your company’s legal team can help. If you are an independent contractor, retain counsel to represent you. Hacking (even with permission) is a risky business.</p>
<h4 class="h2" id="lev13"><strong class="calibre2"><em class="calibre10">Be Aware of and Respect Local Laws</em></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Speaking of consulting with lawyers, work with your counsel to determine if any national, regional, or local laws may restrict the types of activities you can perform in a penetration test or if special care needs to be taken for any particular servers or types of data. For example, some regulations require that customers or patients be notified if their financial or medical records are accessed improperly. Does access by a penetration tester fall under these disclosure requirements? It is far better to ask an attorney than to make an assumption.</p>
<p class="indent">Additionally, be concerned with not only the location of the penetration tester but also that of the target servers, target corporation headquarters and field offices, and, if applicable, the security firm performing the test. Because laws can vary between all of these entities’ locations, it is important to be aware of the rules in every place your assessment will reach. This can be particularly tricky when looking at cloud resources. After all, what if a server is migrated between regions during your testing? It may not be apparent that anything has happened, but suddenly your target is in a new country with vastly different laws. Be sure to discuss this concern with your client when scoping the test to ensure that you are aware of any possible localities its services may reside in during the assessment window. If a customer wants to test a system that resides in a country with unfavorable penetration testing regulations, the customer might even consider migrating the resources to a different region during the test. Just make sure the configuration of the service isn’t changed during the relocation, or it could result in incorrect findings.</p>

<p class="noindent">You made it to the last chapter! How does it feel to be a game designer? A little weird? Don’t worry—that’s normal. Or maybe you don’t <em>feel</em> like a game designer yet. That’s normal too.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_142"/>It’s easy to feel like you’re not qualified to call yourself something. But there are so many different ways to be a game designer. For example, game designers can be people who work at big companies where everyone makes small contributions to a product. Game designers can also be people who sit in their bedrooms making things that they find fun.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Game designers are also people who go to the park to play catch with friends and then wonder, “What if we have to toss the ball under our leg?” or “What if we’re not allowed to touch the ball with our hands?” There are a million-and-a-half different ways to be a game designer.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch7.1">Asking Questions</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You might not have a ton of game design experience yet, but I’ll tell you a cool fact about game design: if you’re doing it right, it should <em>always</em> remain a mystery to you. Even the people who’ve designed games for years are still asking questions about what games could be. “What if you can only move one space every day?” “What kind of game can you play at a protest?” “Why don’t games let you make friends with the monsters instead of fighting them?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Game design is less about finding answers than it is about asking questions. Everyone, regardless of their skill level and experience, can ask questions.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In this chapter, I’ll show you some cool PuzzleScript games other people have made as well as provide you with some exercises to try when you’re making your own games.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch7.2">More PuzzleScript Games to Try</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You learned how to build some PuzzleScript games from scratch. Even if you don’t think your game is perfect, you should be proud that you’ve <em>made something</em>. Many adults who have been making games for way longer than you still have a hard time finishing them.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">But this is only the beginning. What will your next game be like? Keep your mind open so new ideas can get in. Ideas might find you when you’re walking in the park, when you’re staring at the ceiling over your <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_143"/>bed, or even when you’re in the bathroom. Never be too quick to dismiss a daydream; it could be the seed for an amazing game!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the meantime, here are a few more PuzzleScript game examples you can try to see what’s possible with PuzzleScript. Click the <strong>hack</strong> links to see how they work and get ideas to try in your own PuzzleScript games! The games are listed in order from simplest to most complicated.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch7.2.1">Cake Monsters</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><em>Cake Monsters</em> by Matt Rix (<em><a href="http://struct.ca/games/cakemonsters/">http://struct.ca/games/cakemonsters/</a></em>) is about cute monsters who just want to eat a bunch of cake. Each monster can only eat cake that is the same color as they are, but they can combine with other monsters to change color. For example, a red monster and a blue monster can merge to make a purple monster. All the monsters move at the same time, like the cats in <em>Herding Cats</em>!</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="note1"><strong><span class="snote">NOTE:</span></strong> Click <strong>hack</strong> to see the game’s code. In this source code, you can see how to add music to your game: just give PuzzleScript the ID code of a YouTube video.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch7.2.2">Flying Kick</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Created by Aaron Steed, <em>Flying Kick</em> (<em><a href="http://tinyurl.com/puzzlekick/">http://tinyurl.com/puzzlekick/</a></em>) is different from any PuzzleScript game you’ve seen so far. It has a profile perspective similar to that in <em>Super Mario Brothers</em> and is about using mighty jump-kicks to get around. This game’s code uses PuzzleScript’s <code>again</code> command. By putting <code>again</code> at the end of a rule, the game runs another turn immediately. That way, when the player is in a flying kick, they keep flying until they hit something. You can use this command to make some fun and entertaining animations.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch7.2.3">Cute Train</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><em>Cute Train</em> by Mark Wonnacott (<em><a href="http://tinyurl.com/cutetrain/">http://tinyurl.com/cutetrain/</a></em>) is about riding a cute train. Like most trains, the train runs on tracks, but you can change where the tracks go by flipping switches. Hold down the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_144"/>action key when you’re behind the train to ride it along the track, or press the action key when you’re on a switch to flip it. This game uses PuzzleScript’s flickscreen mode. That means that instead of having a series of levels that you play through from start to finish, it has one continuous world to explore.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Sometimes when you look at games other people have made, you can easily get discouraged. You might think to yourself, “Well, that’s way better than anything I could make.” I know because I think that all the time.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">But there’s another way to think about the cool things other people make. You could say, “Wow, I didn’t know you could do that! But now I do! The next thing I make will be <em>so much cooler</em> because of it!”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The more you explore other people’s games, the more likely you’ll be to think of ideas and designs you’ve never thought of before, and the more you’ll learn about what you can make. In fact, every little thing you learn about or play with can make you better at creating your own game because it helps fuel new ideas during the planning stage.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">So don’t let other peoples’ art scare you into thinking you can’t do something similarly cool. Give yourself permission to learn from others’ work. The more PuzzleScript games you play, the more ideas you’ll get! I’ve been making games with PuzzleScript for years, and I’m still coming up with more ideas.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch7.3">Game Challenges</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">When you’re done exploring these games, here are some exercises you can try. Some of them are about challenging yourself to make a game in a new way. Some challenge you to promote your games and work with others.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Don’t worry about completing every game or doing them in order. Do the ones that most excite you and lead you to the most interesting questions.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch7.3.1">Make an Animated GIF of Your Game</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A GIF is a little animated image that you can put on the internet. If you want to show off a cool feature in your game or a neat puzzle, a great <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_145"/>way to capture it is with an animated GIF! PuzzleScript has a built-in feature to record GIF files of your games. Here’s how it works:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Load a level of your game. Remember that you can load any level by holding <small>CTRL</small> and clicking its entry in your game’s <code>LEVELS</code> section.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Do what you want the GIF to capture. Show off the neat rules you came up with, or solve part of your cool level, but not the whole thing! Potential players have to play to see how it ends!</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Hold down <small>CTRL</small> (or <small>CMD</small> on a Mac) and press <strong>K</strong>. This tells Puzzle-Script to make a GIF of everything you did after loading the level.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">In a minute, a window should pop up with your GIF in it! (If you did <em>a lot</em> of stuff before pressing <small>CTRL</small>-K, it might take longer.)</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Right-click the GIF and save it to your computer.</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now you can post your GIF online, email it to friends, and use it to show off your cool game. Maybe it will motivate people to play your game!</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch7.3.2">Post Your Game on itch.io</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The website <em><a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a></em> (<em><a href="https://itch.io/">https://itch.io/</a></em>) is full of hundreds of games (only some of which are made in PuzzleScript). Some people use <em><a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a></em> to sell their games while others give theirs away for free. Posting your game on <em><a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a></em> helps people find it more easily. Now that you know how to make an animated GIF of your game, you can use that GIF as a cover image to show people browsing <em><a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a></em> what your game looks like.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can either <em>embed</em> your game on <em><a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a></em> (you can find instructions on how to do this at <em><a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a></em>) or post a GIF along with a link to your game.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now you’ve designed a game and published it! Good work!</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch7.3.3">Make a Two-Player Game</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Playing a game on your own on your computer can be surprising, exciting, and fun, but playing a game with another person can be even better. When you play a game with someone else, you’re not just playing by the rules of the game; you’re also trying to anticipate, respond to, or make sense of what the other player is doing.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_146"/>How would you go about making a game for two players with PuzzleScript? Here are a few ideas:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li class="noindent">One player controls the arrow keys while the other player presses the action key (X or spacebar) to either help out or cause mischief!</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Make a game with two characters like <em>Robot Heist</em>, but each player controls a different robot. When the second character is activated, the second player takes over the keyboard, and vice versa.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">The players take turns! Imagine a game where one player pushes blocks around to solve a puzzle, and then the second player shows up as a janitor who has to put everything back into the position it was in at the start of the puzzle.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">One player sits at the computer and the other looks at something else. Maybe player 2 has a hand-drawn map and is trying to guide player 1 to a treasure hidden in a PuzzleScript game. Player 1 can’t look at the map, and player 2 can’t look at the screen. They have to communicate information to each other verbally.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="indent">Can you think of any other ways to make a two-player game?</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch7.3.4">Tell a Story with No Words</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">PuzzleScript lets you write messages that appear before and after levels. These messages are perfect for providing instructions, offering clues, and telling parts of the story. Try making a PuzzleScript game that tells a story <em>without</em> using these messages or using very few of them!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">How expressive can you be by just moving objects around a screen without words? How can you communicate your story?</p>&#13;
<p class="indentb">Here are a few items you’ll want to take advantage of to tell your story:</p>&#13;
<p class="bqpara"><strong>What objects look like.</strong> Each object in PuzzleScript is a grid of just 25 dots. But some of the most expressive symbols we see every day are made of just a few dots and lines. How can you use shape and color to create expressive characters?</p>&#13;
<p class="bqpara"><strong>How objects move.</strong> How someone or something moves tells us a lot about it. What does it mean if an object zigzags everywhere instead of moving in straight lines? What if your game has an <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_147"/>object so scary that the rules won’t let the player get close to it, and they can only move if they’re moving away? Watch any cartoon to see how expressive motion can be.</p>&#13;
<p class="bqpara"><strong>Sound.</strong> Different sounds make you feel different ways. Next time you play your favorite game, pay attention to how actions sound. What sound does it make when you collect a coin? How does it make you feel? What about the sound that plays when you fall into a hole? Play with PuzzleScript’s sound buttons to find the sounds that best match what you want each interaction to communicate.</p>&#13;
<p class="bqpara"><strong>Space.</strong> Different kinds of spaces feel different to be in. How does your room feel different than the hallway at your school? You probably spend a lot of time in your room, so you’ve put some effort into making it feel cozy. Hallways, on the other hand, are designed to get people from one place to another: they’re not places you’re meant to linger in. Spaces in video games work the same ways, even though they’re not real.</p>&#13;
<p class="indentt">If you want the player to feel alone, put them in a big open area. If you want them to feel cramped, put them in a tiny hallway. If you want them to feel lost, make everything surrounding them look the same. You’ve probably already instinctively thought about this when you were designing levels without even consciously thinking about it!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Even if you’re not trying to make a word-free game, try to think about these ideas when designing your games! Even small details in your game have an effect on how it feels to play that game.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch7.3.5">Collaborate with Friends</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Try making a game with a friend. It can be very exciting to bounce ideas back and forth with someone else. Each of you can build on what the other has come up with. Some of the most powerful ideas emerge that way, and the energy of collaboration can be really fun.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">There are a lot of different ways to work together on a project. For example, you can write the rules, but you both create a bunch of levels. Maybe you design the levels, and your friend decides how the objects should look. Maybe your friend just plays your game and gives you ideas about how to make it better.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_148"/>Working with other people on creative projects can be tricky, especially when they’re your friends. If you get into an argument about the project, it could affect your friendship. Collaborating feels great when you both have the same level of energy and excitement, but tensions can build when you both have different amounts of energy or availability. At times, you might see one person taking charge of the whole project and making all the decisions.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>Collaboration</em> is all about communication! If someone doesn’t feel like they’re involved enough in decision-making or feels frustrated because they think they’re spending more time on the project than the other person, have a conversation about it! Offer constructive criticism without getting defensive: try to be specific about what the problem is, how it makes you feel, and what could make the situation better.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Collaboration is a lot of work, but it can lead to amazing creations you couldn’t make on your own.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch7.3.6">Make Games with Bitsy</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">If you like drawing objects and writing stories but you’re not as interested in puzzles, you might want to try using Bitsy. Bitsy is a cute little game maker by Adam Le Doux. Like PuzzleScript, it lets you draw characters, write messages, and design little game worlds. It has very little scripting, so if you’re looking for a simpler application than PuzzleScript, Bitsy could be a fun alternative!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can find the Bitsy editor online at <em><a href="http://tinyurl.com/bitsyeditor/">http://tinyurl.com/bitsyeditor/</a>.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To see an example of what you can do with Bitsy, try playing the game <em>You Have to Go to Work</em> by KC at <em><a href="http://tinyurl.com/bitsywork/">http://tinyurl.com/bitsywork/</a></em>.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch7.4">Keep Exploring and Creating!</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The world we live in is not always the best place, and it can be easy to lose hope and joy. Making art—whether that’s games, comics, zines, music, writing, or just a little garden in your window—helps us remember that we’re capable of creating beautiful things. It reminds us to feel wonder for our surroundings and ourselves.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The older you get, the less time you have for play and creating things that don’t make money. Get in the habit of making and doing, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_149"/>and hold onto it as you grow older! It’s never too late to start. Making art will increase your enjoyment for life. <em>For real</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">But this book is just a starting point. Now that you know how to make games using PuzzleScript, it’s up to you to figure out what to do with that knowledge. Follow your ideas wherever they lead you, even if they seem silly, weird, or unoriginal. Keep exploring.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I can’t wait to see what you come up with.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_150"/></p>&#13;

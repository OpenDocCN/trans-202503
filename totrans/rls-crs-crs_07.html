        everyone to see. Rails applications can be deployed in many ways. Rails runs on everything
        from simple shared hosting to dedicated servers to virtual servers in the cloud.</p><p>The cloud application platform known as Heroku is one of the easiest ways to deploy your
        application, and I cover it in this chapter. Heroku uses the Git version control system to
        deploy applications, so we need to talk about version control systems first.</p><div class="sect1" title="Version Control"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="version_control"/>Version Control</h1></div></div></div><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>version control system (VCS)</em></span> records changes to files over time
          so you can easily go back to a specific version later. The <span class="emphasis"><em>repository</em></span>
          is the data structure, usually stored on a server, that holds a copy of the files in the
          VCS and a historical list of changes to those files. With a VCS, you can make changes to
          your source code knowing that you can always go back to the last working version.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1308"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1311"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1353"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1429"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1503"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1653"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1656"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1829"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2014"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2017"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2206"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle2263"/>Originally, version control systems were <span class="emphasis"><em>centralized</em></span>.
          That is, the source code repository was stored on a single server. Developers could
          connect to that server and check out files to make changes to the code. But centralized
          systems also have a single point of failure. Examples of centralized version control
          systems include the Concurrent Version System (CVS) and Subversion.</p><p>The most popular type of version control system today is
            <span class="emphasis"><em>distributed</em></span>. With a distributed version control system, each client
          stores a complete copy of the source code repository. That way, if a single client fails,
          everyone else can continue to work with no loss of data.</p><p>In a distributed system, a central server is still commonly used. Developers
            <span class="emphasis"><em>push</em></span> their changes to this server and <span class="emphasis"><em>pull</em></span>
          changes made by other developers. Popular distributed version control systems include Git
          and Mercurial. Because Heroku uses Git to deploy applications, I’ll focus on
          Git.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Git"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="git"/>Git</h1></div></div></div><p>Git was originally developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for use with the Linux kernel.
          The word <span class="emphasis"><em>git</em></span> is British slang for a despicable person. Torvalds once
          joked that he names all of his projects after himself.</p><p>Git quickly spread beyond the Linux community, and most Ruby projects now use Git,
          including Ruby on Rails. If you don’t already have Git, installation instructions
          can be found in <a class="xref" href="pr03.html#rubycomma_railscomma_and_git" title="Ruby, Rails, and Git">Ruby, Rails, and Git</a>.</p><div class="sect2" title="Setup"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="setup"/>Setup</h2></div></div></div><p>Before you start using Git, set your name and email address. Open a terminal window
            and enter the following command to set your name:</p><a id="pro_id00168"/><pre class="programlisting">$ <span class="strong"><strong>git config --global user.name "</strong></span> <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>Your Name</strong></span></em></span>"</pre><p>The <code class="literal">--global</code> flag tells Git to apply this change to your global
            configuration. Without this flag, the change would only apply to the current repository.
            Also, set your email address:</p><a id="pro_id00169"/><pre class="programlisting">$ <span class="strong"><strong>git config --global user.email "</strong></span> <span class="emphasis"><em><span class="strong"><strong>you@example.com</strong></span></em></span> <span class="strong"><strong>"</strong></span></pre><p>Now every time you commit a change, your name and email address is included, making
            it easy to see who made which changes when working with a team.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Getting Started"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="getting_started"/>Getting Started</h2></div></div></div><p>Now you’re ready to create a repository for the blog.

            application’s files to the repository:</p><a id="pro_id00171"/><pre class="programlisting">$ <span class="strong"><strong>git add .</strong></span></pre><p>The <code class="literal">add</code> command accepts a filename or directory path and adds it
            to Git’s staging area. Files in the staging area are ready to be committed to the
            repository. The dot in the command represents the current directory. So after you run
            this command, all files in the current directory and any subdirectories are ready to be
            committed. When you commit, Git takes a snapshot of the current state of your project
            and stores it in the repository.</p><p>Now commit all staged files to the repository:</p><a id="pro_id00172"/><pre class="programlisting">➊ $ <span class="strong"><strong>git commit -m "Initial commit"</strong></span>

            commit changes related to a single simple feature or bug fix together. That way, all of
            the changes are tied to one commit, making it easier to revert and remove a feature if
            necessary. It’s also a good idea to commit any outstanding changes at the end of a
            working session.</p><div class="sect3" title="Other Useful Commands"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="other_useful_commands"/>Other Useful Commands</h3></div></div></div><p>Git contains many additional commands; enter <code class="literal">git --help</code> to see

Rather than
            install PostgreSQL locally, we used SQLite for development. You’ll need to ensure
            that the PostgreSQL gem, called simply pg, is installed in the production
            environment.</p><p>Heroku also requires the rails_12factor gem, which ensures that your
            application’s assets can be served by Heroku’s servers and that your
            application’s log files are sent to the correct place.</p><p>Open the file <span class="emphasis"><em>Gemfile</em></span> in the root of your Rails application and
            locate the line <code class="literal">gem 'sqlite3'</code>. You’ll use the PostgreSQL gem in
            production, but you still need the SQLite gem for development and testing, so update
            this line by adding <code class="literal">group: [:development, :test]</code> as shown
            here:</p><a id="pro_id00186"/><pre class="programlisting">gem 'sqlite3'<span class="strong"><strong>, group: [:development, :test]</strong></span></pre><p>This instructs the <code class="literal">bundle</code> command to install this gem only in the

            randomly generated name. You could have specified a name after the
              <code class="literal">create</code> command, but the name must be unique. You can always change
            the name later if you want. The <code class="literal">create</code> command also ➋ sets up
            a Git remote named <code class="literal">heroku</code> for you automatically.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Deploying Your Application"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="deploying_your_application"/>Deploying Your Application</h2></div></div></div><p>Everything is ready now, so you can finally deploy your application. Use the

 * [new branch]      master -&gt; master</pre><p>Heroku recognizes this <code class="literal">git push</code> command and automatically detects
            that a Ruby on Rails application is being deployed, installs the production gems
            specified in your <span class="emphasis"><em>Gemfile</em></span>, updates your application’s
            database configuration, precompiles your application’s assets, and launches your
            application.</p><p>When you deploy any application for the first time, you also need to run database
            migrations to create the database tables needed by your application in Heroku’s
            database server. Use the <code class="literal">heroku run</code> command to execute the
              <code class="literal">rake db:migrate</code> command on Heroku’s server:</p><a id="pro_id00192"/><pre class="programlisting">$ <span class="strong"><strong>heroku run rake db:migrate</strong></span>

--<span class="emphasis"><em>snip</em></span>--</pre><p>If you make more database changes to your application, remember to commit the
            changes to the master branch in Git, push the master branch to Heroku, and run this
            command again.</p><p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1636"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1909"/>Now you can open your web browser to the URL Heroku created for you earlier,

          fundamentals of Ruby and Rails. Models represent your application’s data; views are
          the user interface for your application; and controllers are the glue that holds them
          together. You’ll use these concepts to build any application you want.</p><p>Looking at the application you built in <a class="xref" href="pt01.html" title="Part I. Ruby on Rails Fundamentals">Part I</a>,
          you’ll find plenty of areas to improve. For example, anyone can edit or even delete
          posts on your blog. Also, what happens if you write thousands of posts? The index page
          will probably time out before it can display them all! You may not quite have the tools to
          fix those problems right now, but once you dive into <a class="xref" href="pt02.html" title="Part II. Building A Social Net Working App">Part II</a>, that will change.</p><p>In the next part of this book, we’ll build a new social network application and
          cover advanced topics such as more complex data modeling, authentication, testing,
          security, performance optimizations, and debugging.</p><p>After learning these concepts, you’ll be able to solve these problems with the
          blog and build a variety of other applications.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Exercises"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="exercises-id00014"/>Exercises</h1></div></div></div><div class="qandaset" title="Frequently Asked Questions"><a id="ch06qa1"/><table border="0" summary="Q and A Set" width="100%"><col align="left" width="1%"/><col/><tbody><tr class="question" title="Q:"><td align="left" valign="top"><a id="ch06qa1qe1"/><a id="ch06qa1q1"/><p>Q:</p></td><td align="left" valign="top"><p>1. Practice making changes to your application, adding and committing those
                changes to your local Git repository, and then pushing the changes to Heroku. Many

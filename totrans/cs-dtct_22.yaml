    desk sat in the center of the room, its surface clear aside from four baskets
    labeled “In,” “Out,” “To File,” and “To Burn.” A handful of new commendations
    adorned the wall, in addition to the large number Frank already recognized. Only
    the family pictures—charcoal sketches of the captain’s two kids and a family portrait—gave
    any indication of the passage of time.

    the last time he’d sat in this office—his last day as a cop. He’d finally assembled
    enough evidence to go after Rebecca Vinettee yet again, even if some of his methods
    *had* bordered on dangerously randomized. The captain hadn’t seen it the same
    way, though. His focus has been on Frank’s blatant disregard for protocol rather
    than the new evidence. Pushing back the memory, Frank slumped into the right-hand
    chair and waited.

    everything I knew when I came to see you.” Frank started to object, but the captain
    held up his hand. “However, there have been additional developments since we spoke,”
    he continued. “The most recent news reached me this morning.”

    the fact that Socks had let this information slip only by accident. It never paid
    to let your clients know how much of your success was due to other people’s stupidity.

    the anonymous tip we received about a possible attack on the castle, and the whole
    force is on alert. We’ve had to pull people off other posts to step up security.”

    the documents once more. “No leads on the attackers?”

    have come to him if he didn’t suspect an inside job. But there was a substantial
    gap between a general flicker of suspicion and a short list of names.

    running through the thefts. Different stations. Different officers on duty. Even
    different departments.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Frank nodded silently while he turned the thefts over in his mind. He had hit
    the same dead end with the internal transfers. There had been at least one new
    transfer on duty for each incident, but never the same officer twice. Frank had
    briefly considered the possibility of a broad conspiracy throughout the entire
    rookie class, but discarded it immediately. Anyone capable of coordinating such
    a massive betrayal would likely have been able to orchestrate more subtle thefts,
    at least something that didn’t involve alerting every station within a hundred
    miles.

    anything strange.”

    followed a tip to Crannock’s farm and picked up a trail of clues that led him
    to Usb, the Vinettees ship, and Rebecca Vinettee.

    to a wizard named Gretchen. Apparently the king brought in a few senior wizards
    to help with the case.”

    the king brought the wizards in,” said the captain. “After the attack on the convoy,
    the king has mobilized everyone he can. Even Princess Ann is returning from her
    latest quest. She arrives back at the castle tomorrow.”
  prefs: []

    Ann was almost constantly away leading missions, quests, or critical negotiations.
    For her to return, the situation must be bad.

    “You know, the one who tried to destroy the kingdom.”
  prefs: []

    when Exponentious attacked. These days, the tale of his campaign was told in hushed
    voices around the campfire to scare junior wizards and knights.
  prefs: []

    then, but Princess Ann is worried that he wasn’t acting alone. That maybe he had
    followers, accomplices, admirers, something like that. She’s been tracking clues
    about this mysterious new league of wizards apparently bent on destroying the
    kingdom. So far they’ve been staying in the shadows, conducting only small attacks.
    But the royal family is worried.”

    by the Vinettee thug on the *Retry Loop*? If so, what had he gotten himself into?
    Then another thought struck him.
  prefs: []

    return?” Frank asked. “If she’s been out hunting this League of Unnecessary Complexity,
    they could be looking to strike back.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    officers into guard duty when she returns. It’ll leave the armory, prison, and
    police stations low. But we can’t take a chance.”
  prefs: []

  prefs: []

    “Even without the mask, adding a hundred new guards makes it almost impossible
    to recognize everyone. But we’re taking precautions. The royal wizard Marcus created
    magic identification badges for the castle guards. They are almost impossible
    to fake, and they flash bright red if the wearer doesn’t match the name or the
    picture.”

    of Mudwall and Frayed Cable Island. He described the attack in the prison and
    the loss of the documents. Finally, he detailed the recent leads from the threads
    and transfer logs.

    the type. My gut says she’s a good officer. But I’m not sure who to trust right
    now. She shouldn’t be working the case anyway. It’s not her assignment.”

    theft. So unless you have a whole class of traitors, I think it’s a dead end.”

    best-first search I’ve seen in years.”
  prefs: []

    type of investigation as best-first search. More often, a person would say “I’m
    looking into things” or “I’m following up on some leads.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Despite this lack of recognition, best-first search was a staple for every police
    officer, ranking up there with other vital tools like a notebook and a pair of
    comfortable shoes. In best-first search, you kept a list of current leads, picked
    the most promising one to follow, and followed it. Once you had followed that
    lead, you simply picked the next best one to follow. Any new clues found along
    the way were added to the list. It was the single best tool to solve many cases.

    I thought. You better watch your back, Frank.”

    Do you know how Notation knew about the ArrayCart?”

- en: If you remember only one algorithm from this course, it should be best-first
    search. This algorithm will be your best tool on the force. You will need it on
    every case. And, of course, it will be on the final.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Best-first search is an algorithm that chooses the next state to explore based
    on a score or score function. Each newly discovered search state is given a score
    that corresponds to how good the algorithm believes it to be. For example, you
    might label states by their probability of containing the target value (if you
    can estimate it) or the quality of a lead in an investigation. At each step, the
    algorithm chooses to explore the state with the highest score. You can visualize
    the operation of best-first search as keeping a *sorted* list of states to try
    next.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Best-first search can also be used to minimize the costs associated with each
    state, such as the estimated distance of the state to the goal. In this case,
    the algorithm chooses the next state by which one most minimizes the cost.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consider a very simple maze where you know the coordinates of the start and
    the goal locations. You can label each state in the search space with a cost equal
    to the distance from that state to the goal. For example, you could use the *Manhattan
    distance*—the total vertical distance to the goal plus the total horizontal distance
    to the goal. This label doesn’t necessarily mean that this state will get you
    there, but it does provide a signal for the search algorithm.

    circles), find new unexplored states, and add the unexplored states to the list
    of states to try (enclosed in dashed circles). In each iteration, the search selects
    the best unexplored state according to the score or cost. In this example, this
    means selecting the state with the smallest cost.

    to try first.

    be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it

- en: Initially, these and other obstacles were tackled by people like David Chaum,
    one of the early pioneers of digital money. Chaum studied problems in cryptography
    while completing his PhD at the University of California, Berkeley, and was particularly
    interested in ways people could transfer money digitally and anonymously. He went
    on to create DigiCash in 1992, a company whose mission was to establish a digital,
    anonymous cash system (called *e-cash*). The system used a concept called blind
    signatures to guarantee the anonymity of its users, but a central company or bank
    was needed to ensure that each unit of ecash wasn’t spent twice. Chaum’s was not
    the only digital money company. By the mid-1990s, several private companies were
    developing electronic cash systems, mainly hoping to facilitate online purchases
    in the then nascent Internet. In addition to DigiCash, others—including First
    Virtual Holdings, Cybercash, and even a division of Microsoft—were significantly
    invested in developing digital money solutions. At the time, the use of credit
    cards to make payments via the Internet was rare, and these efforts were seen
    as critical to enabling e-commerce.

    Virtual Holdings、Cybercash，甚至微软的一个部门在内的其他公司也在大力投资开发数字货币解决方案。当时，通过互联网使用信用卡进行支付仍然很少见，这些努力被视为推动电子商务发展的关键。

    A trusted middleman was needed to keep track of everyone’s transactions. Unfortunately,
    many companies like DigiCash had much difficulty garnering that kind of trust
    from consumers and banks (whose cooperation they also needed). The reluctance
    was understandable: If a company operating a digital money system collapsed due
    to a catastrophic event, the value of the currency units could vanish overnight.'

    companies was that a government agency might force them to close. Digital currencies
    were such recent inventions that the regulations to manage them were absent or
    ambiguous. Consequently, digital currency companies did not have a good idea of

    of the primary advantages of e-cash. These impediments, combined with slow adoption,
    forced DigiCash to declare bankruptcy in 1998\. Other companies faced even worse
    fates. Gold & Silver Reserve Inc., which maintained a gold-backed digital currency

- en: '• **Portability:** In a perfect world, money should be light, compact, and
    easily transported. By this measure, bitcoins easily trounce paper currency: Bitcoins
    weigh nothing, are stored effortlessly even in large quantities, and can be moved
    across the world within minutes. Of course, as part of a world financial system,
    electronic mechanisms are available for storing and transporting traditional currencies
    in digital form, improving the portability of those currencies as well. However,
    in terms of simplicity, cost, and speed of portability, Bitcoin has clear advantages
    at this time.'

  zh: • **便携性：** 在一个理想的世界里，货币应该是轻便的、紧凑的，并且容易运输。从这个角度来看，比特币轻松超越了纸币：比特币没有重量，可以轻松存储，即使是大量的比特币也不成问题，并且可以在几分钟内跨越全球。当然，作为全球金融体系的一部分，也有电子机制可以用来以数字形式存储和运输传统货币，从而提高这些货币的便携性。然而，就便捷性、成本和便携速度而言，目前比特币显然具有优势。
- en: • **Divisibility:** Everyone knows the frustration of needing to pay someone
    a small dollar amount but only having a large bill and no change. This problem
    cannot exist with bitcoins since bitcoins are completely divisible to fractions
    of a penny. Because computers are efficient at crunching numbers, it’s no surprise
    that they can handle the task of dividing Bitcoin amounts in any way necessary
    to make change.

  zh: • **可分性：** 每个人都知道，想付给别人少量的钱却只有大钞而没有零钱的沮丧感。比特币不存在这个问题，因为比特币可以完全分割成分的零头。由于计算机在处理数字方面非常高效，能够根据需要将比特币的金额划分成任何必要的部分以找零，毫不意外。
- en: • **Durability:** By design, every bitcoin is stored within the Bitcoin block-chain,
    a computer file that is stored on many thousands of computers across the world.
    As long as a person doesn’t lose the private key that protects their money, that
    person’s bitcoins are indestructible. On the other hand, the US Federal Reserve
    estimates the life span of a dollar bill at 5.9 years.^([12](../Text/footnote.html#footnote30))
  id: totrans-60

    be maintained into the future. Although the value of a bitcoin in the future is
    unpredictable and volatile day to day, it has generally increased from year to
    year. One can certainly argue, however, that durability of Bitcoin in terms of
    maintaining its value is not a certainty until the network of users grows much
    larger.
  id: totrans-61

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: • **Scarcity:** The primary innovation of Bitcoin is the decentralized creation
    of scarcity for a digital asset, which is necessary for bitcoins to retain any
    monetary value. Therefore, like paper money, bitcoins can maintain a limited supply.
    However, with paper money you need to trust the government (i.e., the owner of
    the printing presses) to maintain this scarcity over time and hence prevent inflation.
  id: totrans-62
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: • **Fungibility:** It’s important for any dollar bill—or any bitcoin—to be equally
    valid for payment. If a recipient of money constantly needs to worry about whether
    they have received “good money” or “bad money,” the utility of the currency is
    damaged. As you know, paper money can be traced physically by tracking the serial
    numbers on bills or electronically through tracing mechanisms built into our modern
    electronic payment system. Similarly, bitcoins are traceable by following coins
    through the public blockchain. Hence, neither traditional currency nor Bitcoin
    has a clear advantage in terms of fungibility.

    a web client in order to browse online. This model for using the Internet is commonly
    called a *client-server architecture*. However, since those days, many new Internet-based
    applications have started using a *peer-to-peer architecture*. In this decentralized
    model, a software application finds other “like-minded” peer applications on the
    Internet and connects with these peers to operate the application. Early applications

    terms, have become less violent). If Bitcoin volatility continues to decrease,
    this trend may give Bitcoin a significant advantage over future cryptocurrencies:

    it may make sense for new cryptocurrencies to use *pegging* to link themselves
    to the Bitcoin network instead of trying to replace the Bitcoin network entirely.
    Recently, two well-known cryptocurrency developers and entrepreneurs, Adam Back
    and Austin Hill, have suggested that the value of new cryptocurrencies could be
    directly linked one-to-one with the value of a bitcoin by using cryptography to
    allow coins to “ jump” between block-chains using clever algorithms. If this idea
    succeeds, it may be possible to create cryptocurrencies with new technological
    advancements into *side chains* of Bitcoin. Side chains are separate blockchains
    with different rules that share the same pool of coins as Bitcoin, allowing the
    new currency to share the same volatility (or lack thereof, potentially) and network
    benefits as Bitcoin proper.

    1 percent of the world’s transactions, then each bitcoin would need to be worth
    tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars.

    these staggering numbers (if it ever does). We will always use many different
    assets as a form of savings (stocks will never go away, for example, no matter
    how popular Bitcoin gets), and we will use many different payment mechanisms.
    That being said, nothing stops Bitcoin from being used to some degree as *both*
    a medium of exchange and a form of savings, and the more widely it is used, the
    more useful and convenient it will be to its users.

    adoption scenarios, but we have little basis for predicting just how much it will
    be adopted. Depending on the adoption level we assume, we could forecast virtually
    any value of a future bitcoin, from hundreds of dollars to millions. Somewhat
    ridiculously, if we assume almost all of the world’s savings are stored in Bitcoin,
    we can even imagine a billion-dollar bitcoin, because the amount of savings and
    assets in the world is so incredibly immense!

    the value of bitcoins in the future. The best we can do is suggest that Bitcoin
    has potential as a technology, and in the future it could be a big deal—that is,
    if it doesn’t first fail in the many possible ways we’ve considered.

    could be used to denominate the prices of goods as an international standard.
    Using Bitcoin as a *unit of account* is certainly an intriguing idea, and this
    purpose is commonly mentioned in economic texts as an important role of money,
    but it would have negligible economic impact on the future world economy. The
    reason is that using Bitcoin as a pricing standard, in itself, doesn’t directly
    affect how many bitcoins or other goods are bought or sold, simply because you
    can “measure” items in Bitcoin without needing to own them.

    the Bitcoin network is anything but a waste. However, in this book we’ve described
    many benefits of Bitcoin that provide some justification for its use of energy.

- en: Bitcoin mining uses a concept called *proof-of-work* to secure the system. In
    this system, new blocks (and bitcoins) are awarded randomly to miners based proportionally
    to the number of hashing calculations they perform. However, some developers have
    attempted to build cryptocurrencies that adopt a different concept called *proof-of-stake*,
    which awards blocks in a manner proportional to the amount of currency a miner
    holds (or proportional to a similar metric, such as the number of coins owned
    multiplied by the days the coins have remained unspent). Two currencies that use
    this approach are Peercoin^* and NXT.^(**)

    expenditure required by a proof-of-work currency, like Bitcoin. However, it isn’t
    clear whether proof-of-stake-based currencies are as secure as proof-of-work-based
    ones. Just as proof-of-work-based systems are “vulnerable” to a 51 percent attack,
    proof-of-stake-based systems have their own vulnerabilities (51 percent attacks
    are described in detail in [Chapter 8](../Text/ch08.html#ch08)). Although we know
    that a 51 percent attack in a proof-of-work-based system requires extraordinary
    resources and is economically irrational for the attacker, attacks on proof-of-stake-based
    systems may be easier than on proof-of-work-based system. Peercoin mitigates this
    issue by combining proof-of-stake with some additional proof-of-work to maintain
    stronger security. NXT addresses this issue by adding nuances to the consensus
    mechanism to decide which blocks are valid, potentially sacrificing some decentralization
    in the process.

    that the inability of governments to print more currency units would seriously
    damage economic growth.^([14](../Text/footnote.html#footnote34)) They contend
    that the scarcity enforced by Bitcoin’s cap would drive *nominal deflation*, which
    is when the price of everyday goods denominated in bitcoins would drop over time,
    causing the circulation of the currency to freeze up and forcing the economy into
    a depression. The rationale is that individuals would postpone their purchases

    destabilize governments. It has been debated that Bitcoin is part of a larger
    movement, recently termed *radical decentralization*, which maintains that all
    decentralization (including the functions of the government) is desirable and
    possible. This idea is a direct extension of the philosophies of Friedrich Hayek,
    who reasoned that local control is usually preferable to central control, because
    local people have more knowledge about local conditions and can therefore behave
    more efficiently in most situations. However, it is true that governments benefit
    from having control over their currency supply. Governments encounter challenges
    when they attempt to raise funds via direct taxation, and printing money to fund
    government projects is known as “taxing by inflation,” which is both easier for
    governments to do and harder for citizens to stop. The loss of this means of raising
    money for government projects (including military defense) could reduce the financial
    viability of some governments.

    while completing his PhD at the University of California, Berkeley, and was particularly
    interested in ways people could transfer money digitally and anonymously. He went
    on to create DigiCash in 1992, a company whose mission was to establish a digital,
    anonymous cash system (called *e-cash*). The system used a concept called blind
    signatures to guarantee the anonymity of its users, but a central company or bank
    was needed to ensure that each unit of ecash wasn’t spent twice. Chaum’s was not
    the only digital money company. By the mid-1990s, several private companies were
    developing electronic cash systems, mainly hoping to facilitate online purchases
    in the then nascent Internet. In addition to DigiCash, others—including First
    Virtual Holdings, Cybercash, and even a division of Microsoft—were significantly
    invested in developing digital money solutions. At the time, the use of credit
    cards to make payments via the Internet was rare, and these efforts were seen

    companies was that a government agency might force them to close. Digital currencies

    of the primary advantages of e-cash. These impediments, combined with slow adoption,
    forced DigiCash to declare bankruptcy in 1998\. Other companies faced even worse
    fates. Gold & Silver Reserve Inc., which maintained a gold-backed digital currency
    called e-gold, was shut down. Its proprietors were indicted by the US Department

    maintaining its value is not a certainty until the network of users grows much
    larger.

    of scarcity for a digital asset, which is necessary for bitcoins to retain any
    monetary value. Therefore, like paper money, bitcoins can maintain a limited supply.
    However, with paper money you need to trust the government (i.e., the owner of
    the printing presses) to maintain this scarcity over time and hence prevent inflation.
  prefs: []

    valid for payment. If a recipient of money constantly needs to worry about whether
    they have received “good money” or “bad money,” the utility of the currency is
    damaged. As you know, paper money can be traced physically by tracking the serial
    numbers on bills or electronically through tracing mechanisms built into our modern

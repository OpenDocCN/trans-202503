 <strong>AN INTRODUCTION TO SCRATCHJR</strong>
</h2>
<p class="noindent">In recent years there has been a proliferation of educational apps and games, full of flashy graphics and engaging music, for young children. But many of these educational apps have been frustrating for parents and teachers. The <a id="page_2"></a>
 problem: very few educational apps provide young children with opportunities to design, create, and express themselves. That’s what motivated us to create ScratchJr.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec04">
<strong>WHAT IS SCRATCHJR?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">ScratchJr is an introductory programming language that encourages creativity and expression, enabling five- to seven-year-old children to create their own interactive projects through <em>coding</em>
 , as it is often called these days.</p>
<p class="indent">Using ScratchJr, children can snap together programming blocks to make characters move, jump, dance, and sing. They can modify how their characters look, design their own backgrounds, add their own voices and sounds and even photos of themselves—and then use the programming blocks to bring their characters to life.</p>
<p class="indent">ScratchJr was inspired by the popular Scratch programming language, used by millions of young people (ages eight and up) around the world. We redesigned the interface and programming language to make it developmentally appropriate, as well as fun and engaging, for younger children.</p>
<p class="indent">Based on feedback from children, parents, and teachers, we went through dozens of prototypes for ScratchJr to make it as effective as possible for its purpose. We hope that you find it a useful tool for engaging children.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec05">
<strong>WHY DID WE CREATE SCRATCHJR?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">We believe that every child should be given the opportunity to learn how to code. Coding is often seen as difficult or exclusive, but we see it as a new type of literacy—a skill that should be <a id="page_3"></a>
 accessible for everyone. Coding helps learners to organize their thinking and express their ideas, just as writing does.</p>
<p class="indent">As young children code with ScratchJr, they learn how to create and express themselves with the computer, rather than just interact with software created by others. Children learn to think sequentially, explore cause and effect, and develop design and problem-solving skills. At the same time, they learn to use math and language in a meaningful and motivating context.</p>
<p class="indent">As children use ScratchJr, they aren’t just learning to code, they are coding to learn.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec06">
<strong>WHO IS THIS BOOK FOR?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">This book is for anyone who wants to help children learn to code and, more broadly, to think creatively and reason systematically. It was written particularly for people without coding experience or technical expertise, but it can also be helpful for those who do have expertise but don’t have experience working with young children.</p>
<p class="indent">ScratchJr was designed especially for five- to seven-year-olds as a precursor to other programming languages. With a little additional support, younger children can enjoy it too, and it can also be useful for introducing older children to coding before they move on to other programming languages (like Scratch).</p>
<p class="indent">And, of course, for parents or educators without any coding knowledge, this book is a good way to learn the basics of coding. The best way to learn something new is to teach it to someone else. So as you help young children learn to code, you’ll be learning too.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec07"><a id="page_4"></a>
 <strong>WHAT DO YOU NEED?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You need to have ScratchJr downloaded on a tablet. ScratchJr is available free of charge and runs on iOS and Android devices. There are links to download ScratchJr at <em>
<a href="http://www.scratchjr.org/">http://www.scratchjr.org/</a>
</em>
 . You can download it from the App Store for an iPad, and it runs on second-generation or newer iPads. Download it from the Google Play Store if you have a 7-inch Android tablet or larger that runs Android 4.2 (Kit Kat) or later.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec08">
<strong>WHAT’S IN THIS BOOK?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">This book consists of four chapters. <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 introduces some initial activities to familiarize you with the basic features of ScratchJr. The rest of the book assumes you can make your way around ScratchJr, so don’t skip the first chapter! The remaining chapters describe projects that young children can create with ScratchJr. <a href="text00008.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 shows playful animations, <a href="text00009.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 shows how to tell interactive stories, and <a href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 shows how to create fun games.</p>
<p class="indent">Each chapter is made up of a set of short activities that introduce new programming blocks and features and a final project to integrate all of this knowledge. Each activity reinforces ageappropriate math and literacy skills, and includes tips and challenges for children who want to explore more.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the appendices have resources and references to help you make the best use of ScratchJr.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec09"><a id="page_5"></a>
 <strong>HOW SHOULD YOU USE THIS BOOK?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">We developed the projects as a sequence of activities that will incrementally teach different aspects of ScratchJr in a developmentally appropriate way. But don’t feel as though you need to follow this book step-by-step. Feel free to mix and match and adapt our suggested projects to your own and your child’s interests. Follow your child’s lead. Every detour is a child-directed learning experience. ScratchJr is a tool for self-expression. Children should feel free to explore ScratchJr’s many buttons and features and to use characters and backgrounds that are meaningful to them. This is something we hear frequently from parents and teachers.</p>
<p class="indent">And please, do let us know how it’s going! Hearing about all the different ways you’ve used this book will help us to improve ScratchJr further. Send your comments to <em>

<p class="indent">As young children code with ScratchJr, they learn how to create and express themselves with the computer, rather than just interact with software created by others. Children learn to think sequentially, explore cause and effect, and develop design and problem-solving skills.

<strong>WHO IS THIS BOOK FOR?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">This book is for anyone who wants to help children learn to code and, more broadly, to think creatively and reason systematically. It was written particularly for people without coding experience or technical expertise, but it can also be helpful for those who do have expertise but don’t have experience working with young children.</p>
<p class="indent">ScratchJr was designed especially for five- to seven-year-olds as a precursor to other programming languages. With a little additional support, younger children can enjoy it too, and it can also be useful for introducing older children to coding before they move on to other programming languages (like Scratch).</p>
<p class="indent">And, of course, for parents or educators without any coding knowledge, this book is a good way to learn the basics of coding. The best way to learn something new is to teach it to someone else. So as you help young children learn to code, you’ll be learning too.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec07"><a id="page_4"></a>
 <strong>WHAT DO YOU NEED?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">You need to have ScratchJr downloaded on a tablet. ScratchJr is available free of charge and runs on iOS and Android devices. There are links to download ScratchJr at <em>
<a href="http://www.scratchjr.org/">http://www.scratchjr.org/</a>
</em>
 . You can download it from the App Store for an iPad, and it runs on second-generation or newer iPads. Download it from the Google Play Store if you have a 7-inch Android tablet or larger that runs Android 4.2 (Kit Kat) or later.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec08">
<strong>WHAT’S IN THIS BOOK?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">This book consists of four chapters. <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 introduces some initial activities to familiarize you with the basic features of ScratchJr. The rest of the book assumes you can make your way around ScratchJr, so don’t skip the first chapter! The remaining chapters describe projects that young children can create with ScratchJr. <a href="text00008.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 shows playful animations, <a href="text00009.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 shows how to tell interactive stories, and <a href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 shows how to create fun games.</p>
<p class="indent">Each chapter is made up of a set of short activities that introduce new programming blocks and features and a final project to integrate all of this knowledge. Each activity reinforces ageappropriate math and literacy skills, and includes tips and challenges for children who want to explore more.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the appendices have resources and references to help you make the best use of ScratchJr.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec09"><a id="page_5"></a>
 <strong>HOW SHOULD YOU USE THIS BOOK?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">We developed the projects as a sequence of activities that will incrementally teach different aspects of ScratchJr in a developmentally appropriate way. But don’t feel as though you need to follow this book step-by-step. Feel free to mix and match and adapt our suggested projects to your own and your child’s interests. Follow your child’s lead. Every detour is a child-directed learning experience. ScratchJr is a tool for self-expression. Children should feel free to explore ScratchJr’s many buttons and features and to use characters and backgrounds that are meaningful to them. This is something we hear frequently from parents and teachers.</p>
<p class="indent">And please, do let us know how it’s going! Hearing about all the different ways you’ve used this book will help us to improve ScratchJr further. Send your comments to <em>

<p class="indent">Based on feedback from children, parents, and teachers, we went through dozens of prototypes for ScratchJr to make it as effective as possible for its purpose. We hope that you find it a useful tool for engaging children.</p>

<p class="noindent">We developed the projects as a sequence of activities that will incrementally teach different aspects of ScratchJr in a developmentally appropriate way. But don’t feel as though you need to follow this book step-by-step. Feel free to mix and match and adapt our suggested projects to your own and your child’s interests. Follow your child’s lead. Every detour is a child-directed learning experience. ScratchJr is a tool for self-expression. Children should feel free to explore ScratchJr’s many buttons and features and to use characters and backgrounds that are meaningful to them. This is something we hear frequently from parents and teachers.</p>

<p class="noindent">This book is for anyone who wants to help children learn to code and, more broadly, to think creatively and reason systematically. It was written particularly for people without coding experience or technical expertise, but it can also be helpful for those who do have expertise but don’t have experience working with young children.</p>
<p class="indent">ScratchJr was designed especially for five- to seven-year-olds as a precursor to other programming languages. With a little additional support, younger children can enjoy it too, and it can also be useful for introducing older children to coding before they move on to other programming languages (like Scratch).</p>
<p class="indent">And, of course, for parents or educators without any coding knowledge, this book is a good way to learn the basics of coding. The best way to learn something new is to teach it to someone else. So as you help young children learn to code, you’ll be learning too.</p>

<strong>WHAT’S IN THIS BOOK?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">This book consists of four chapters. <a href="text00007.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 introduces some initial activities to familiarize you with the basic features of ScratchJr. The rest of the book assumes you can make your way around ScratchJr, so don’t skip the first chapter! The remaining chapters describe projects that young children can create with ScratchJr. <a href="text00008.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a>
 shows playful animations, <a href="text00009.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 shows how to tell interactive stories, and <a href="text00010.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>
 shows how to create fun games.</p>
<p class="indent">Each chapter is made up of a set of short activities that introduce new programming blocks and features and a final project to integrate all of this knowledge. Each activity reinforces ageappropriate math and literacy skills, and includes tips and challenges for children who want to explore more.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the appendices have resources and references to help you make the best use of ScratchJr.</p>

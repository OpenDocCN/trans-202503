<span class="ChapterTitle">Managing All the Things</span></h1>
</header>
<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">M</span>ost of the other chapters of this book are meant to tell the story of how Android was built, piece by piece, and of the people who put together those pieces. But some of the people helping to pull things together weren’t responsible for individual pieces; they were responsible for the overall effort. Welcome to the “business” side of Android.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c27-0001">Andy Rubin and Managing Android</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Andy Rubin’s interest in robots was there from the start of his career when he worked at Carl Zeiss AG on robotics. He later took a job with Apple, where he acquired the nickname “Android.” Later, he was at WebTV with other future Android people, where Mike Cleron remembered him as “the crazy guy down the hall who played with robots.”</p>
<p>After WebTV, Andy founded Danger and then, eventually, a startup that he named “Android.” </p>
<p>Although Andy was running Android, both before and after the acquisition by Google, he generally let others manage the people. Chris White led engineering for the first six months, in addition to working on system architecture and design, but eventually Steve Horowitz was brought in to manage the growing team. After Steve left, around 1.0, Hiroshi Lockheimer took over. Andy depended on this management layer to deal with the people on the team while he focused on the business aspects of the project, like partner meetings.</p>
<p>Andy left the team while he was at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in early 2013. Hiroshi told how he and Tracey were with Andy in a series of partner meetings: “That’s when he decided to tell us he was leaving. It was after the LG meeting and before the Samsung meeting. We had a 15-minute <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_256" title="256"/>break. He had told [Tracey] already, at some break or something. I was blissfully unaware. Kicked everyone out. It was just Andy and me. He was like, ‘I’ve been doing this for 10 years. I’m tired. I’m going to leave.’”</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c27-0002">Tracey Cole and Administrating Android</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">One of the people responsible for a smooth transition after Andy Rubin left was Tracey Cole. Tracey had been Andy’s administrative assistant for 14 years and was the lead admin for Android when he left. She knew how to get things done in Android, and at Google, and she wasn’t going anywhere. </p>
<p>In August of 2000, Tracey Cole was working as an admin at a biotech firm and wanted out. A friend suggested she talk to his friend Andy at Danger. She interviewed with Andy and Danger’s other founders (Joe Britt and Matt Hershenson, both of whom joined the Android team years later) and became the admin for that team. When Andy left Danger in 2003 Tracey stayed behind but continued helping him on the side. Then, in the Fall of 2004, she joined Andy’s startup, Android, starting work on the same day as Brian Swetland.</p>
<p>When Google acquired Android, Tracey moved over with the rest of the team. She was aware they were talking to Google, but not how far things had gotten, “I remember him meeting Larry and they hit it off. I went on vacation and came back and all of a sudden we were going to be working at Google.” </p>
<p>Tracey continued to be Andy’s assistant at Google, as well as leading the admin group in Android, until he left Android in 2013. At that point, she continued in her role administering the overall Android team and leading the other admins on the project, and also became Hiroshi’s assistant. </p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c27-0003">Hiroshi Lockheimer and Partners</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">When Hiroshi Lockheimer first got to Google, he managed partner companies, working with OEMs and carriers to get Android working on their devices and networks.</p>
<p>Hiroshi always wanted to be an architect: “Of buildings. Not a software architect. Actual building architecture.” He wasn’t interested in computers and didn’t encounter programming until his first (and only) term at college. School didn’t agree with him, and he went back home to Japan. But he’d caught the software bug. Back at home, he taught himself programming and started picking up consulting jobs. He also worked on hobby projects, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_257" title="257"/>including a text engine<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c27-footnote-1" id="c27-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup> for the Be operating system, which he open sourced. This work got noticed by people at Be, and Hiroshi landed a job there, moving to California in December of 1996.</p>
<p>Hiroshi joined Be right after an episode where Apple nearly acquired Be to provide the next MacOS. But Apple acquired NeXT Computer instead. Hiroshi recalled, “We were the company that wasn’t bought.”</p>
<p>Three years later, Hiroshi was ready for something new. Hiroshi’s colleague at Be, Steve Horowitz, introduced Hiroshi to Andy Rubin, and Hiroshi joined Danger. “I ended up being the first employee at Danger Research. There were three founders, and I was the first lackey they hired.”</p>
<p>Hiroshi brought other Be (and future Android) engineers into Danger: Brian Swetland and Ficus Kirkpatrick. But Hiroshi himself didn’t last long there, leaving after just eight months.</p>
<p>After Danger, Hiroshi worked briefly at Palm, the same company that many Be engineers joined when Palm acquired Be a year later. After leaving Palm, he managed an engineering team at Good Technology (which was working on mobile communications software), and then joined Steve Horowitz again in early 2005. Steve was then leading the IPTV team at Microsoft. </p>
<p>By the end of 2005, Hiroshi was again ready for a change. “I was on vacation in Japan and Andy emailed me out of the blue. Hadn’t talked to the guy since whenever I left him back in whenever it was [at Danger]. He’s like, ‘Hey I’m at Google now doing some stuff that I think you’ll like.’ He knew that I liked wireless devices. ‘I think you should come talk to us.’</p>
<p>“I was at Microsoft, working on set top boxes at the time. It just wasn’t for me; I really missed working on mobile devices. So I called him back in January.”</p>
<p>The interview and hiring process at Google has never been known for its swiftness or simplicity, but Hiroshi’s case is especially unique.</p>
<p>Despite Hiroshi’s relevant experience and long track record in related tech companies, Hiroshi wasn’t a shoo-in for Google interviews, especially since he didn’t have a college degree. Steve Horowitz said, “Google at the time was very focused on pedigree. Google was like, ‘He has no degree, I’m not sure we can hire him.’ They were putting up a big fight.”</p>
<p>Hiroshi said, “Twenty-some interviews, because they couldn’t figure out how to hire me. They made me write an essay. Literally. I don’t know if they <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_258" title="258"/>fully grokked<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c27-footnote-2" id="c27-footnoteref-2">2</a></sup> the irony. They gave me homework to write an essay on why I didn’t finish college.</p>
<p>“I was this close to saying ‘Screw it.’”</p>
<p>Finally, the team was able to convince the Google hiring committee to hire Hiroshi. But even with that agreement, plus the results of 20+ interviews, and what must have been a stellar “Why I Dropped Out” essay, the hiring committee still refused to hire Hiroshi as an engineer. Hiroshi said, “They hired me under sort-of ‘Misc,’ and decided I should have the title of ‘Technical Program Manager.’”</p>
<p>Through 1.0, Hiroshi was involved in the initial meetings with partner companies and worked with them to make sure that things happened. “It was the technology side of business, or the business side of technology, depending on how you look at it. We build software. But without partnerships, without hardware from someone else, especially back then when we didn’t have Nexus or Pixel. . . . It was all reliant on OEM partners and operators who were going to ship these things. It was my job to program-manage that.”</p>
<p>Brian Swetland commented on Hiroshi’s role in managing partners: “No one wrangled partners the way he did, partially because a) he’s really focused, but b) he’s really technical. So he always understood the underlying technical issues, which was really helpful when we were trying to extract information we needed from partners, or to get them to do something that needed to be explained.”</p>
<p>Hiroshi worked closely with the systems team because that was where Android software interfaced with partner hardware. “Swetland and I would go to Taipei. He would stay there for three weeks. I would go for a week, and then he’d be solo for the remainder of the trip. Making sure bring-up was happening. Bringing up the kernel, bringing up peripherals—he would be working with their engineers to do that, hardware and software. And then the prototypes would arrive here, and then the higher-level folks would run their stuff on it.”</p>
<p>Around the time that 1.0 shipped, Steve Horowitz left Google. Andy was still in charge of Android but having someone else as engineering director had worked well with Steve, so Hiroshi took on that role. Tracey Cole said, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_259" title="259"/>“Andy leaned on Hiroshi very much, let him manage the team. He didn’t like to manage people. He let Hiroshi take the reins on that.”</p>
<p>Wei Huang credits Hiroshi with the engineering culture of Android: “Hiroshi was willing to dive into the details with me, to understand how things were working. Even when he became a VP, still running Android, he still reached out to us, to figure out ‘Hey, SMS is not working, Hangouts is not working.’ I think he was able to connect with the rest of the team, not just people who reported to him. Also, he cared about the product and that showed. And I think the way he communicated was down to earth. I really liked having Hiroshi in between us and Andy.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how he could do it. How do you do it in a way that was genuine, and also having enough technical knowledge to ask the right questions? That’s why he’s where he is.”</p>
<p>Hiroshi continued managing the engineering team through the Droid release and after, instituting traditions like Bacon Sundays<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c27-footnote-3" id="c27-footnoteref-3">3</a></sup> to pull everything together at the end to ship each release.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c27-footnote-4" id="c27-footnoteref-4">4</a></sup></p>

<blockquote class="Epigraph" epub:type="epigraph">
<p class="Epigraph">If you look at the history of where we are and who “got” mobile and who didn’t, it all goes back to the leaders and whether they had faith or vision at the time.</p>
<p class="EpigraphSource">—Steve Horowitz</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="BodyFirst">Steve Horowitz was the engineering director for the Android team up to 1.0. He started on Android in February of 2006, after the team had started growing. There were around 20 engineers on the team when he began and almost 100 by the time they hit 1.0 nearly three years later.</p>
<p>Steve Horowitz learned BASIC and assembly on an Apple II in elementary school. In high school, he split his time between tech journalism and programming. He ended up getting an internship at Apple<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c27-footnote-5" id="c27-footnoteref-5">5</a></sup> straight out of high school and worked there every summer after that through college. After graduating, he joined Apple full time to work on Pink, a project to develop the next MacOS, and then Jaguar, which was developing next-generation hardware.</p>
<p>After two years at Apple, Steve went to Be, Inc., where he worked on UI toolkit functionality for BeOS, like the Tracker (the equivalent of Finder on the Mac). After several years at Be, Steve moved to Microsoft, joining the WebTV division just after it was acquired by Microsoft. There, he worked with future Android people like Mike Cleron, Andy Rubin, and Wei Huang. He also eventually hired Hiroshi to run the system software group for the Microsoft IPTV platform. Steve transitioned into management while he was at Microsoft, which led to his future role on Android.</p>
<p>While at Microsoft, Steve got an interesting offer from Tony Fadell<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c27-footnote-6" id="c27-footnoteref-6">6</a></sup> at Apple to run a systems software group for the iPod, at the time when that team was starting to think about the iPhone. “It was a good offer. But I had a lot of Microsoft stock, and they gave me an offer with a little bit of Apple stock. At the time, I liked what I was doing at Microsoft. The Apple offer looked interesting, but Apple [stock] would have had to go up a hundred <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_261" title="261"/>times for it to be even close. Of course, sure enough, they did—more than a hundred times.</p>
<p>“Some parts of Tony’s team, and this other guy Scott Forstall, were competing for what the architecture of the iPhone OS was going to be. In the end, I think Forstall’s version won, but people from Tony’s team moved over and became part of that effort. So in some weird alternate universe, I could have been working on iOS instead of Android.”</p>
<p>Over the years that Steve was at Microsoft, Andy Rubin tried to get him to join Danger, but Steve wasn’t convinced that they had what it would take, so he stayed where he was.</p>
<p>Then in the Fall of 2005, a couple of months after Android was acquired by Google, Andy tried again. “He said, ‘I’d like you to come over and run engineering for Android—we just got acquired by Google.’ When I talked to him and realized it was Google that was going to try this thing, I thought all the ingredients are now in place to actually disrupt mobile. I told Andy I’d do it.”</p>
<p>Steve started on Android in February of 2006, as the Director of Engineering for Android.</p>
<p>Part of Steve’s job on Android was to recruit talent. One of the people he brought in almost immediately was Mike Cleron, from his team at Microsoft.</p>
<p>Engineers on the team remember Steve’s strong management skills, bringing calm to the team, and a discipline about cutting features so that they could hit their aggressive 1.0 schedule. Steve’s priority was always getting the product to ship. </p>
<p>Michael Morrissey also remembered Steve’s effectiveness in dealing with Google: “Steve was really, really good at managing the bureaucracy of Google. He knew how to navigate and work around process and procedure that didn’t benefit Android.”</p>
<p>One of the responsibilities of managers is helping the careers of the people on the team. But career wasn’t the burning issue at that time; there would be plenty of time to talk about that after 1.0. There was work to do. Romain remembered hearing from Steve on weekends during that crunch-time period, where he’d get a single IM: “yt?,”<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c27-footnote-7" id="c27-footnoteref-7">7</a></sup> which would start a conversation, usually about a bug that needed fixing.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c27-0005"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_262" title="262"/>Mobile World Congress</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Steve was part of the leadership team on Android, so he was both managing engineering and assisting on the business side. “Right after I joined, Andy, Rich Miner, and I went to MWC<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c27-footnote-8" id="c27-footnoteref-8">8</a></sup> with this idea of Android. It was basically a Flash demo; there really wasn’t much there.</p>
<p>“We were meeting with and pitching as many people as we could on this idea of Android. We had this little room off to the side we’d bring people in. For the most part, they scoffed at us: ‘Come back when you’ve grown up.’ But we had a meeting with Paul Jacobs and Sanjay Jha [Qualcomm executives] and they got excited. They were enthusiastic and wanted to explore more. The other guys were dismissive.</p>
<p>“If you look at the history of where we are and who ‘got’ mobile, who won mobile and who didn’t, it all goes back to the leaders and whether they had faith or vision at the time.</p>
<p>“The funny thing about MWC: contrast. If you look back at what it was back then, it was nothing other than this idea we were pitching, to where it is today, and it’s just like . . . it is <em>all</em> Android.” That is, Android went from having a hard time getting anyone’s attention at MWC back then to today’s reality, with Android having such a large presence at the show.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c27-0006">Managing Conflict</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">One of Steve’s big jobs was navigating the differences between the various sub-teams. There were very strong divisions between the engineers that came from Danger and those that came from Be/PalmSource and WebTV/Microsoft. </p>
<p>“That’s the thing about Android—like any team, it’s stitching together personalities. It’s certainly a lesson to anybody that small teams of incredibly talented people will win the day over big teams. There’s no question. And that’s obviously what we had in Android. But with that talent and that energy comes opportunity for conflict, interpersonally, architecturally. That’s what I helped steer.”</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c27-0007">Leaving Android</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Shortly after 1.0, Steve left Android (and Google). He was interested in a larger role, where he’d get to do more than engineering management. After he left, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_263" title="263"/>Hiroshi took over the team. There’s always that wonder, when we choose a certain path in our careers, or our lives: What if we’d taken the other road? Steve reflected, “The interesting question, which nobody could really answer including myself: If I knew then that Android would be what it is today, would I have made the same decision or not? Honestly, I don’t know.”<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c27-footnote-9" id="c27-footnoteref-9">9</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c27-0008">Ryan PC Gibson Gets His Just Desserts</h2>
<blockquote class="Epigraph" epub:type="epigraph">
<p class="Epigraph">Android was “under the radar” at the time, but I heard whispers. Cool whispers.</p>
<p class="EpigraphSource">—Ryan PC Gibson</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="BodyFirst">The larger a project is, and the larger the team is, the harder it is for things to stay on track or to hit a particular schedule. It’s everyone’s job to make sure that it does, but it is the particular skill set of what Google calls Technical Program Managers (TPMs) to see to the details. Hiroshi was doing this (as part of his job) on the partner side. Ryan PC Gibson was doing it for the platform.</p>
<p>Ryan’s introduction to programming came from watching his mother meticulously copy BASIC programs from magazines into their Atari 800XL. “I learned that programming was mostly typing. To this day, I don’t understand why software development takes so long.”</p>
<p>Ryan joined Google in July of 2005. He arrived the same month that Android was acquired, but worked elsewhere in Google, on a software project for an internal sales tool. He was always interested in mobile technology, so he started looking around to see if there was anything closer to his interests. “Android was ‘under the radar’ at the time, but I heard whispers. Cool whispers.”</p>
<p>He got an introduction to Andy and Hiroshi, and he interviewed with Mike Cleron. “He showed me Sooner, which had a keyboard and small D-pad. Compared to those old Nokias it was awesome, although navigating a 2D matrix of apps seemed clunky. Touch was right around the corner and changed <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_264" title="264"/>everything. I joined [the Android team] in January of 2007 and it felt like being back at one of my previous startups (with better food and solid financials).”</p>
<p>Being a TPM at that time was tricky, because many teams were unfamiliar with that role. As was Ryan himself. “I was a software developer for most of my career but had started to gravitate towards management. I never officially did the program or project managing thing before, so really had to figure it out as we went along. What added to the challenge was there were very few TPMs at Google at the time and most Googlers had never had a TPM on their team.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, Android provided ample opportunity for good program management, and the early team recognized the benefits. “Hiroshi, Mike Cleron, Dianne, and Brian Swetland had all had good experiences with program managers in past companies. They understood the value they could add in successfully shipping products. We were still pains-in-the-ass, but in a helpful way. Secondly, the nature of the Android project lent itself to dedicated program management by meeting three important criteria: 1) lots of diverse contributors—Android devs, Google app devs, open source devs, 2) lots of diverse stakeholders—OEMs, carriers, SOC providers, and 3) hard timelines of the annual sales cycles for electronics. So Android was a good place to be a program manager.”</p>
<p>The problem was huge: how to create, solidify, and ship an entire operating system, applications, and a device as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the team was still coming together and many of the fundamental pieces of the platform hadn’t even been figured out, much less written. But they still needed to come up with a realistic schedule and start executing to it. And they needed the product to come out soon enough that it would actually be relevant. “Program management definitely played an important part. We were a year behind, and had we slipped into the next year might have been a historic footnote rather than a viable alternative. But we couldn’t just ship anything—it had to be solid.”</p>
<p>“Day one, Hiroshi handed me an electronic Gantt chart of hundreds of tasks, stretching out way past our delivery date. He accompanied it with an ‘Aagh, help!’ I think. In retrospect, it was a classic project management challenge, but it was all new to me. I talked with all the developers, about 30 at the time. It helped to come from being a developer with a startup background.</p>
<p>“I started off helping the software engineers organize their work into a series of milestones that led up to the 1.0 launch. That was a wild time, since <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_265" title="265"/>we had to figure out how to stabilize the code base while the business and product plans were still up in the air. In those early days, I was pretty excited about Agile development,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c27-footnote-10" id="c27-footnoteref-10">10</a></sup> but there was deep-seated skepticism within Android. Bad experiences of poorly run Agile groups at other companies had soured a lot of the leadership. But with an evolving product definition, the project actually lent itself to time-boxed development. No one knew when we’d be done since it wasn’t clear yet what ‘done’ meant.</p>
<p>“I created a few initial milestones, ‘m1,’ ‘m2,’ etc., and flipped the question around: ‘What could we get done by each milestone?’ I cautiously asked the developers for rough estimates in ‘Ideal Engineering Days’ (IEDs) but avoided traditional Agile terminology as much as possible. IEDs largely worked for those first few milestones, and we figured out how to burn down feature work and see progress towards some goals. The biggest win was moving feature work tracking over from that Gantt chart into where bug work was already being tracked. Over the years, we migrated away from estimating in IEDs but a lot of the rhythm of the release—things like Zero Bug Bounce,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c27-footnote-11" id="c27-footnoteref-11">11</a></sup> Feature Complete, etc.—stuck around. It’s been improved immensely as we learned from our mistakes, and progressively got larger and more sophisticated.”</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c27-0009">Dessert Time</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Android’s tradition of using desserts for release names found its roots in Ryan’s project management techniques. “I recall a lot of early debates about what ‘1.0’ meant. Dianne, Swetland, and others felt really passionate about that definition. To move the conversation on, I suggested we use code names and figure out which one would be 1.0 later on. Dianne agreed on the condition they were alphabetical, so Astro Boy<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c27-footnote-12" id="c27-footnoteref-12">12</a></sup> and Bender<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c27-footnote-13" id="c27-footnoteref-13">13</a></sup> were obviously going <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_266" title="266"/>to be our first Android code names! We were set for C3PO to be the third, and that looked like it would end up being 1.0 . . . which turned out to be problematic.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c27-footnote-14" id="c27-footnoteref-14">14</a></sup> Dealing with licensing issues would just slow us down, and we realized that could happen for a lot of future releases also. We needed something else, and I was (still am) pretty obsessed with cupcakes. I loved the idea too that we could celebrate our release with Sprinkles,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c27-footnote-15" id="c27-footnoteref-15">15</a></sup> so the dessert thing kicked off for realz!”</p>
<p>Michael Morrissey remembered Ryan’s contributions to getting the releases out there “by just being a constant velvet hammer, who understood enough of the technology side, but was focused on keeping the schedule moving ahead.”</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c27-0010">Peisun Wu and Project Management</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">A peer of Ryan’s on Hiroshi’s TPM team was Peisun Wu, who joined in September of 2007. Although she had been working at Google as an engineering manager, she joined Android as a TPM because she had done that job before and that’s what they needed at the time as they moved toward shipping 1.0.</p>
<p>Peisun’s introduction to computer programming matched that of many engineers’: video games. When she was in third grade, her parents decided that she played enough games and that they wouldn’t buy any more for her. “Heck,” she thought. “If I can’t buy a game, maybe I could try to figure out how to make my own.” She spent much of the next year at the library, reading programming books and playing around with the computer at the library, until she’d saved enough money from household chores to get her own computer at home.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_267" title="267"/>Years later, with a degree in cognitive science, she worked at a couple of startups, dealing with ways to manage unstructured data. The second of these companies, Applied Semantics, was acquired by Google in 2003 for their advertising technology, which eventually became Google’s AdSense product.</p>
<p>At Google, Peisun worked on the search appliance,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c27-footnote-16" id="c27-footnoteref-16">16</a></sup> then Google Checkout, and finally joined the Android team in 2007, around the time that the public SDK was first released.</p>
<p>Peisun worked with several different groups on Android in her time there, starting with the media team. She managed relationships with external companies and their technologies, including PacketVideo (which provided the software that powered Android’s video capabilities) and Esmertec. </p>
<p>Esmertec provided media applications that Android would ship with the device, including a music app as well as an Instant Messaging (IM) client. There were a lot of details to getting that app to work correctly with the underlying messaging platform on Android, as well as with the late changes in UI design, and Peisun joined the team for trips to Beijing and Zurich to work with the Chengdu, China–based engineering team of Esmertec to get those details right.</p>
<p>On one of her trips to Zurich, she noticed that one of the Esmertec engineers had brought a suitcase entirely filled with hot sauce. Chengdu, in the Sichuan province, is known for its spicy food, and Zurich is . . . not. The suitcase full of spice was seen as an important workaround for the current situation of living in Zurich for those two weeks.</p>
<p>Besides her work on media and messaging, Peisun also helped Dan Borstein with Dalvik launch schedules, helped get some of the early fonts for the device, and helped out with the hardware team in testing devices for FCC approval. This kind of multi-project work wasn’t unusual on the team at the time: “Back then it wasn’t like, ‘This person’s on this team—it was just like whatever help needed was required. Whoever was available just jumped in.”</p>

I had deep admiration for, and faith in, the core Android team and wanted to use as much of their code as possible that would facilitate much faster upgrades and a better user experience.” The strategy worked: the Moto X was upgraded to the KitKat release faster than any other OEM’s devices, including Google’s Nexus phones.</p></aside>

In all of my years on Android, I have yet to see the team get anywhere near zero. I redefined the acronym to Ze Bug Bounce. We definitely bounced . . . just not off of zero bugs.</p></aside>

<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c27-footnoteref-14" id="c27-footnote-14">14.</a></sup>  The reason we use dessert names is that desserts can’t be trademarked. Of course, we have used trademarked names for a couple of the releases (K and O), but those involved agreements between companies. I don’t think that anyone wanted to get into negotiating trademark agreements for every Android release back in the early days. Besides, there are a lot more dessert names to choose from than robots. Wouldn’t it have been unfortunate to have stopped developing more Android releases just because we ran out of names we could use?</p></aside>

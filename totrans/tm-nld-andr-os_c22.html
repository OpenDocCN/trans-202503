<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">T</span>oday, we take it for granted that there’s a place we go to buy our apps. You have a phone, you want an app—you go to the application store to get it. Obviously.</p>
<p>But back before Android and the iPhone, that simple ecosystem didn’t exist. </p>
<p>It’s not that companies didn’t want it to exist; they kept trying to create something like it. You could buy services from carriers (mostly ringtones and simple utilities), and there were various repositories for games. But the market for apps wasn’t there (since there wasn’t a lot that apps could do on those limited devices, at that time), so users weren’t missing much. But once there were devices powerful enough to run real applications, users needed an easy way to get them.</p>
<p>But carriers had created <em>walled gardens</em><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c22-footnote-1" id="c22-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup> where they controlled access to the earlier app stores. They wanted to ensure that malicious or bad apps couldn’t take down their network, so they didn’t want random applications running on their network that they could not control. They created curated places, like the app store on the Danger phones. But that extra layer of process and hassle dissuaded many developers from uploading apps, and prevented larger app store ecosystems from coming into being.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_222" title="222"/>Android wanted to fix this problem with Android Market. They wanted a store that anyone could upload apps to. Michael Morrissey, who was leading the services team on Android, told Nick Sears his goal: “I want a fourteen-year-old kid sitting in Kansas to be able to write an app in the morning and upload it in the afternoon to Android Market and have it go out to sell to all the customers.” </p>
<p>This concept concerned T-Mobile (Android’s launch partner for the 1.0 device, the G1). How could they verify that that kid in Kansas couldn’t upload something that would take down their network?</p>
<p>And so began a long discussion between Android and T-Mobile to iron out the details that would make this work. There were two things that the Android team had to do to get T-Mobile to agree. First was assuring T-Mobile that their network would be safe. Second was allowing them to have their own curated app store, alongside Android’s.</p>
<p>The first item, safety, began with having a secure platform. Given the kernel-level sandboxing of apps, the team was able to convince the carrier that Linux security standards would be sufficient. Next, the team required that developers actually sign in, and used existing infrastructure and policies vetted on YouTube to validate that the individual did not present an unreasonable risk for the company. Also, they used the power of crowd-sourcing, putting in place a system whereby users could report bad apps and the team would take them down. Finally, they convinced the carrier that, as much as T-Mobile would suffer if they had network problems, so would Google. Android’s, and Google’s, reputation was on the line. So Android had all the right incentives to make this system work and for the apps and network to be secure and safe.</p>
<p>For the second item, a custom store for T-Mobile, Google created what Nick called, “a store within a store.” The actual application store was on Google’s infrastructure, but T-Mobile was offered primary placement within the store for a limited set of apps that they curated. This placated T-Mobile enough to get them to that first release. But eventually this just went away; other carriers didn’t demand this as part of their deals, and everyone realized that there was no particular reason for this requirement. All of the work was on Google to manage that infrastructure, and the open application store system seemed to be working.</p>
<p>The garden walls came down, and Android got T-Mobile to agree to let them have an application store on the platform. Now they just had to build it.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_223" title="223"/>The application store for Android was developed in the services team, which was responsible for Google services and device management. But the team hired other people to figure out how to host and sell applications. The project was called <em>vending machine</em> internally. When it launched, it was called Android Market.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c22-footnote-2" id="c22-footnoteref-2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Having an application store was always part of the plan. But the project started late, since the top priority was shipping the 1.0 release and the G1. When the G1 launched, Market was there, but it was clearly not a finished product. For one thing, it was called Market Beta.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c22-footnote-3" id="c22-footnoteref-3">3</a></sup> More significant, users couldn’t actually purchase applications. Instead, all apps could be downloaded for a cost of . . . $0. While the mechanisms of developers uploading their apps to Market and users downloading apps to their phones worked, the additional step of charging users (and paying developers) took more time and effort. The initial version of Market was great for users who want free stuff, but it wasn’t as good for developers, who usually want to be paid for their efforts.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c22-footnote-4" id="c22-footnoteref-4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>The team brought in some much-needed expertise from the Google payments team. Arturo Crespo helped pull together the necessary infrastructure that allowed Market to process payments for applications. By the time Android 1.1 launched, in February of 2009, Market had the ability to sell applications (and developers had the ability to make money from their Android apps).</p>
<p>Market was one of the attractions of Android in the early days. It was easy to upload an application to the store and make it available to the growing set of Android users. Dan Lew, an external Android developer working on travel apps at the time, said, “I worked on a bunch of silly side project apps. Android was a good place for that because putting up a nearly pointless app on the Play Store is relatively painless.”</p>
<p>But Market was more than a convenience for developers and for users; it helped create a world of apps that made Android a powerful ecosystem that went way beyond the phones people bought and the operating system <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_224" title="224"/>running on those phones. Users were able to benefit from not just the basic phone and built-in capabilities, but also from the almost limitless potential of apps that they could install. It was Android Market that helped create this powerful dynamic for the Android platform overall.</p>

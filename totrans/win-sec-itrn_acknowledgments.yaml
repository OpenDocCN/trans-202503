- en: Few books are written in complete isolation, and this one certainly doesn’t
    break that mold. I’d like to take the opportunity to thank some of the many people
    who have contributed to making this tome a reality. I apologize to anyone I’ve
    forgotten.

- en: I must start by acknowledging the contribution of my wife, Huayi, who cheers
    me up when I’m down and kicks me (metaphorically) when I’m being lazy. Without
    her by my side, the past few years would have been much less agreeable. The rest
    of my family are just as important; without them, my life would be so very different.

    review a valuable experience, teaching me many PowerShell tricks I didn’t know
    existed and providing important feedback on the structure and content.

- en: I’m not the only person doing significant research on Windows. While there are
    far too many to list here, I’d like to acknowledge the following people who have
    made important contributions to my work. First is Alex Ionescu, well-known Windows
    internals guru and my sometimes collaborator (or competitor), who always seems
    to know some weird bit of operating system esoterica. Then there are the many
    practitioners of Windows enterprise security research and testing, such as Lee
    Christensen, Will Schroeder, and Nick Landers. They’ve been important sounding
    boards for my understanding of software like Active Directory and Kerberos and
    have actively tested and contributed to my tooling projects.

- en: I’d be remiss not to mention the amazing researchers from my more formative
    years, especially Pete and Rich; you know who you are. Also, I’d like to thank
    Rob and his team for looking at early drafts of my book’s chapters and providing
    valuable feedback.

- en: My relationship with Microsoft has had its ups and downs. That said, I’d like
    to thank many of its current and former employees who have helped me along the
    way. This includes Katie Moussouris, who was instrumental in convincing me that
    it pays to find bugs in Microsoft products. Without her friendship and contributions,
    I doubt I’d be as successful as I am today. Then there’s Nate Warfield, who for
    many years was my point of contact at the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC),
    where he shielded me from much of the company’s party politics and ensured the
    bugs I reported got fixed in a timely manner. Finally, I’d like to thank current
    MSRC representatives, including Nic Fillingham and Stephanie Calabrese, for helping
    me when I need to contact someone deep inside the beast, and for providing me
    with swag.

- en: 'Special thanks to my Google colleagues, who support me in making and breaking
    things on Windows. This includes the entirety of the current Google Project Zero
    team and its alumni: the best set of security researchers you’ll likely ever find
    in a single room, or even two. Then there’s Will Harris, my friend and colleague
    on the Chromium Windows sandbox team, who asked me many of the questions about
    Windows security on which this book is based. Finally, thanks to Heather Adkins,
    who was instrumental in my being allowed to write a book of this nature while
    keeping a job at Google.'

    and been patient with me: especially Alex Freed, my longtime editor, who unfortunately
    left before this book was published, and Frances Saux, who became my new editor
    after Alex’s departure and pulled this book, kicking and screaming, to completion.
    Finally, I must thank Bill Pollock, who is a good friend and always has amazing
    advice on the book writing process, as well as the latest recommendations for
    incredible restaurants.'

    my gratitude to all the friends and colleagues who contribute massively every
    day to my life and success. Thanks also to you, for picking up my book. I hope
    you find the information about Windows security contained herein to be useful.

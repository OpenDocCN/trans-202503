<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">A</span>ndroid, like basically every other piece of technology, is not so much the product and releases that ship as it is the people who built it and the collective experience that they brought to bear in shaping it. So the story of how Android (the phone OS) came to be starts much earlier than the startup, in the collective histories of the people on the team.</p>
<p>Android happened because so many other efforts happened first. Or, more precisely, Android exists because the people who built it worked together previously at various other companies, in an ever-shifting Venn diagram of mobile and desktop platform companies. It was at these other companies that the early Android pioneers built up their knowledge, skills, and collaboration with their peers. When they arrived on the Android team, they were able to hit the ground running and build a new operating system from scratch in a relatively short amount of time.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_8" title="8"/>The companies that had the biggest impact on the early Android team were Be/PalmSource,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnote-1" id="c02-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup> WebTV/Microsoft, and Danger. None of them fed directly into Android, and most of them failed to make a large dent in the marketplace. But all of them provided a fertile proving ground where engineers learned critical skills that they would capitalize on when they later built the Android OS.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c02-0001">Be, Inc.</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The Be Operating System (BeOS) is now just a footnote<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnote-2" id="c02-footnoteref-2">2</a></sup> in computer history. In fact, you may not have even heard of Be or BeOS before, much less used the company’s software or hardware. But Be’s impact on computing platforms is huge, if for no other reason than that it collected, either as employees or as avid users and developers, so many of the people who later went on to form Android.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnote-3" id="c02-footnoteref-3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Be was a late entrant to the desktop computing wars, coming along in the early 1990s with a new OS that attempted to compete with the entrenched Microsoft and Apple desktop systems. It didn’t fare well.</p>
<p>Be tried various things along the way. They sold their own computer hardware (the BeBox). They ported BeOS to PC and Mac hardware and attempted selling the OS. They were almost acquired by Apple (in fact, they got an offer, but while Be’s CEO was stalling as a negotiating ploy, Steve Jobs swooped in and convinced Apple to buy his company, NeXT Computer, instead). In 1999, they went through an underwhelming initial public offering (IPO).<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnote-4" id="c02-footnoteref-4">4</a></sup> Then in 2000, when nobody was buying Be’s hardware or OS, the company tried what the team called a “Focus Shift,” building an OS for an internet appliance device, which people also didn’t buy. </p>

</figure>
<p>Finally, in 2001, Be was acquired by Palm (which then spun out that division into a new company called PalmSource), to build the operating system for future Palm devices. To be specific, Palm acquired the intellectual property (IP) of Be and hired many of Be’s employees; Palm didn’t acquire the company, the debts, or the assets (like the office furniture).<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnote-5" id="c02-footnoteref-5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Be is significant in Android history for a couple reasons. First, Be attracted engineers who were interested in all aspects of operating system development, from user interfaces to graphics to device drivers (getting the system to talk to hardware, like printers and displays) to the kernel (low-level system software that handles the heavy-lifting for the basics that the platform needs). Working on these kinds of projects creates exactly the kinds of skills needed to build an OS like Android.</p>
<p>Also, BeOS became a cult classic in operating systems. Engineers all over the world stumbled upon Be during college or in hobby projects and tinkered around with it. Be’s advanced capabilities in multimedia,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnote-6" id="c02-footnoteref-6">6</a></sup> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_10" title="10"/>multiprocessing,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnote-7" id="c02-footnoteref-7">7</a></sup> and multithreading<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnote-8" id="c02-footnoteref-8">8</a></sup> made it an interesting playground for engineers interested in OS development. Many of the engineers on Android who didn’t actually work at Be had played around with BeOS on their own and developed a passion for operating system development, which they later used on the Android team.</p>
<p>When Be was acquired, half of the engineers went to work for Palm (soon PalmSource).<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnote-9" id="c02-footnoteref-9">9</a></sup> There, they continued working on operating systems, building Palm OS Cobalt, which didn’t end up shipping with any devices. Along the way, the engineering team continued honing their skills in OS development, while also gaining experience in mobile devices, which were the target of their Palm OS efforts. </p>

</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_11" title="11"/>PalmSource was itself acquired by ACCESS in late 2005. Uninspired by the direction of the new company, many of the former Be engineers found their way to the Android project at Google. By mid-2006, ex-Be employees made up a third of the Android team.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c02-0002">WebTV/Microsoft</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">WebTV was founded in mid-1995 and was acquired by Microsoft less than two years later, in April of 1997.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnote-10" id="c02-footnoteref-10">10</a></sup> The people who came to Android from Microsoft in those early years came specifically from the team that started out as WebTV, as well as other TV/internet groups like IPTV that were part of the same division.</p>
<p>WebTV provided one of the first systems to bring the internet to televisions. This seems silly today, when many of us consume most or all of our television content through internet services on our TVs. But back then, these were very different worlds, and most people’s access to the internet was through PCs.</p>
<p>The team at WebTV was creating a platform for users to consume content that wasn’t just television, so they needed to create the software platform that ran on the hardware, the user interface layer to build apps, and applications for that platform. The team built an operating system, a UI toolkit (the system responsible for user interaction in applications), a programming layer for writing applications, and applications for an internet-enabled device. All of these efforts resulted in practical experience that would come in handy for the people who later found themselves on Android building very similar things.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c02-0003">Danger, Inc.</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Danger, Inc. was founded in December of 1999 by Andy Rubin, Matt Hershenson, and Joe Britt. Initially, the company was building a portable data <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_12" title="12"/>exchange device, nicknamed “Nutter Butter”<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnote-11" id="c02-footnoteref-11">11</a></sup> because it was shaped like the cookie of that name.</p>

<figcaption><p>Danger’s Nutter Butter device. It was made for exchanging data, not for snacking. (Picture courtesy Nick Sears.)</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>During the dot-com implosion in 2000–2001, the company pivoted to a device that would automatically sync data wirelessly. But it wasn’t a phone. Yet. Then, in January of 2001, Andy met with T-Mobile’s Nick Sears at CES.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnote-12" id="c02-footnoteref-12">12</a></sup> </p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c02-0004">Nick Sears and Mobile Data</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">In 1984, Nick was a private in the US Army working an administrative job to earn college benefits. Then he watched Apple’s legendary 1984 ad during the Super Bowl. “I knew we were at the beginning of a technology revolution. I walked into ComputerLand, dropped $3,200, and walked out with an IBM PC (one floppy disk drive), DOS, turbo pascal, Lotus Notes, WordStar, and a dot-matrix printer. During the day, I was a 40-words-per-minute machine. At night, I became a mild-mannered computer nerd.”</p>
<p>Nick coupled his computer skills with a business degree and joined  McCaw Communications in the late 80s. From his vantage point inside McCaw, he watched the growth of both the mobile industry and the internet for the next decade. By the year 2000, he had moved to T-Mobile,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnote-13" id="c02-footnoteref-13">13</a></sup> where he was a vice president in charge of the company’s wireless data strategy.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_13" title="13"/>T-Mobile had recently dedicated a team to the wireless internet, which they wanted to grow. They were the only carrier in the US with GPRS<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnote-14" id="c02-footnoteref-14">14</a></sup> technology, and their data network was ready about a year before those of other carriers. Nick was tasked with making it happen. This meant going out and finding, or creating if necessary, devices that would need and use this new data network.</p>
<p>Nick and his team realized a richer internet experience wasn’t going to happen without a better keyboard experience. Doing anything interesting on the web just wasn’t feasible, or pleasant, with the traditional 12-key dial pads on phones at that time.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnote-15" id="c02-footnoteref-15">15</a></sup> So the team was looking specifically for potential devices with QWERTY keyboards.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnote-16" id="c02-footnoteref-16">16</a></sup></p>
<p>T-Mobile was already working with RIM,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnote-17" id="c02-footnoteref-17">17</a></sup> and had convinced them to add phone capabilities to their previously data-only BlackBerry device. But the form factor of those devices (especially with the belt clip popular with users) wasn’t going to appeal to consumers, who were looking for something less business-centric.</p>
<p>Nick went to CES in 2001, hunting for consumer device possibilities. He met with Danger’s CEO, Andy Rubin, who showed him a mockup of the latest version of Danger’s device. Like BlackBerry, it also was data-only. And like BlackBerry, Nick told Andy that T-Mobile needed it to be a phone, so Danger pivoted to add phone capabilities and partnered with T-Mobile for that first device.</p>
<p>Nick reflected on T-Mobile’s push for these new data-enabled phones, “We’re the ones that put the phones in smartphones.”</p>
<p>In October of 2002, Danger released their resulting <em>Hiptop</em><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnote-18" id="c02-footnoteref-18">18</a></sup> phone . . . but T-Mobile insisted on renaming it. As Nick explained: “Business executives <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_14" title="14"/>and engineers were wearing BlackBerry devices on their hips like HP calculators, and we didn’t think consumers would do that with a phone.” The device was released as the T-Mobile Sidekick.</p>
<p>This device occupied a middle ground between the feature phones of that time and the smartphones of the future. For example, the Hiptop offered a real web browser (compared to the very limited mobile browsers prevalent on phones in those days). Also, Danger phones had an app store, which was one of the first of its kind. But that store was curated by T-Mobile; carriers at that time held control over the applications that could run on their network, which was called the <em>walled garden.</em><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnote-19" id="c02-footnoteref-19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>These features, along with cloud/network capabilities, including the Hiptop’s persistent connection for immediate email and chat updates, plus over-the-air updates, would be seen later on Android, as would some of the developers that made it all work on the Danger phones.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Danger phones never broke through from cult status to mass-market success. The combination of internet email, messaging, and browsing, along with T-Mobile’s aggressive unlimited data pricing, created a phone with powerful capabilities for the time. Danger devices garnered a lot of attention, especially in tech<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnote-20" id="c02-footnoteref-20">20</a></sup> and pop culture circles (including the second Hiptop device being featured in the 2006 film <em>The Devil Wears Prada</em>). But the phones failed to capture the minds and wallets of consumers. Nevertheless, these devices were important in moving the mobile field forward, from the technology that was created, to the new experiences these devices enabled, to the team of engineers that Danger educated along the way.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c02-0005">All Together Now</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Most of the early Android team worked at one or more of these companies: Be/PalmSource, WebTV/Microsoft, and Danger. Through mid-2006, those people represented at least 70 percent of the team, and continued to be a majority of the team until 2007. </p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_15" title="15"/><figure>
<img alt="" class="" src="image_fi/502680c02/f02004.png"/>
<figcaption><p>Most of the people who joined the Android team through 2006 had worked at one or more of Be/PalmSource, WebTV/Microsoft, and Danger.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It has always been a fact in tech, and in Silicon Valley in particular, that people move around between companies and end up working together in different places and contexts throughout their careers. It’s never a good idea to burn bridges when you leave companies. For one thing, being decent to people is just the right thing to do. But in Silicon Valley, it’s a really bad idea to burn those bridges, because the odds are very high that your future self will need to cross those bridges with some of those very same people; it would be handy if the bridges weren’t on fire at the time.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnote-21" id="c02-footnoteref-21">21</a></sup></p>
<p>In the case of Android, it was much more than this indirect and coincidental effect of people ending up at the same company later on. The early team leaned heavily on their prior company experiences and brought in people who (a) they already had a working relationship with and (b) had experience working on exactly what Android needed: operating systems, embedded devices, and developer platforms.</p>
<p>By joining Android together early on, these people jump-started a tight team of colleagues who knew what they were doing, which allowed them to build this new OS much faster than would have otherwise been possible.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_16" title="16"/>Xavier Ducrohet, who joined in 2007 to work on tools, observed, “Those first people came from elsewhere—very few from Google. People who had shipped OSes. How many people have done that? They shipped small OSes and learned from their mistakes.”</p>
<p>Dan Egnor, who also joined in 2007 to work on the over-the-air update system, noticed the team dynamic with the people who were there already. “There was this strong sense through shared history: people know each other, they know what parts of each other they were grumpy about, what parts they’d respect, what people could be trusted to accomplish, and they have clear domains of ownership. People’s names would roll off each other’s tongues even if they’d only been on the team a couple of months. People had this strong sense of knowing what other people did and how they did it.”</p>
<p>Not all of these other companies or their products were successful. But the knowledge gained in building them contributed hugely to the Android teams’ ability to build a working platform later. Steve Horowitz, who worked at Be and the WebTV team at Microsoft and later managed the Android engineering team, said, “That’s part of this world: you learn probably more from the failures than you do from the successes.”</p>
<p>Dianne Hackborn, who worked at Be and PalmSource before joining the early Android team, said, “Most of us had a number of failures behind us before working on Android, where the situation or the timing or something else wasn’t there for success. I count three to four failed platforms I worked on before Android. But we kept trying, learning from each of those failures, and using the knowledge gained from that to help our work on Android.”</p>

<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnoteref-4" id="c02-footnote-4">4.</a></sup>  Michael Morrissey, who later led the services team on Android, left Be soon after the IPO: “That did not go as well as planned, Red Hat had just had a really big IPO, and it changed the dynamics of the OS industry.”</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnoteref-5" id="c02-footnote-5">5.</a></sup>  Jeff Hamilton, who was at Be and later Android, talked about Be selling the assets: “They had an auction for all of the physical assets of the company; the chairs, the monitors. . . . I went and bought the monitor off my desk, because it was a nice Sony Trinitron. The company that ran the auction (they gathered all the stuff, took the cash, managed all of that) went bankrupt between when they sold all of the stuff and when they were supposed to pay it out. So Be didn’t ever see a dime for the physical assets that they sold. It seemed like the canonical Tech Bubble bursting story.” So Be did sell its assets, but was never actually paid for them.</p></aside>

<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnoteref-8" id="c02-footnote-8">8.</a></sup>  Multithreading is the ability for a single process to run multiple threads executing concurrently, either on separate processors or on a single, shared processor. BeOS was known for having a multithreaded UI, which was (and still is) unusual. It offered performance benefits for users, at the cost of complexity for app developers. Android originally took a similar approach (implemented by a former BeOS engineer), but eventually scrapped it in favor of a less fragile single-threaded UI model.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnoteref-9" id="c02-footnote-9">9.</a></sup>  Mathias Agopian remembered: “Palm took 50 people from Be, then did a layoff days after we joined and told us that it was only fair that we participated.

<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c02-footnoteref-10" id="c02-footnote-10">10.</a></sup>  WebTV was acquired around the same time that Microsoft also acquired an internet startup where I was working at the time. The details of our smaller company’s acquisition were never made public, and I’m not about to do so here, but suffice it to say that when we learned that WebTV was being acquired for $425 million, we felt worse about our own deal. A lot worse. Of course, WebTV had a larger team and an actual product, and this division went on to make products that Microsoft sold for some time, which was a far better turnout than the products my startup worked on. So maybe that higher purchase price was justified. Maybe.</p></aside>

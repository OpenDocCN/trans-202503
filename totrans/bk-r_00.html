<p class="noindent">R plays a key role in a wide variety of research and data analysis projects because it makes many modern statistical methods, both simple and advanced, readily available and easy to use. It’s true, however, that a beginner to R is often new to programming in general. As a beginner, you must not only learn to use R for your specific data analysis goals but also learn to think like a programmer. This is partly why R has a bit of a reputation for being “hard”—but rest assured, that really isn’t the case.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="introlev1sec01"><strong>A Brief History of R</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">R is based heavily on the S language, first developed in the 1960s and 1970s by researchers at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey (for an overview, see, for example, <a href="ref.xhtml#ref07">Becker et al., 1988</a>). With a view to embracing open source software, R’s developers—Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland in New Zealand—released it in the early 1990s under the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxviii"/>GNU public license. (The software was named for Ross and Robert’s shared first initial.) Since then, the popularity of R has grown in leaps and bounds because of its unrivaled flexibility for data analysis and powerful graphical tools, all available for the princely sum of <em>nothing</em>. Perhaps the most appealing feature of R is that any researcher can contribute code in the form of <em>packages</em> (or <em>libraries</em>), so the rest of the world has fast access to developments in statistics and data science (see <a href="app01.xhtml#app01lev1sec97">Section A.2</a>).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Today, the main source code archives are maintained by a dedicated group known as the <em>R Core Team</em>, and R is a collaborative effort. You can find the names of the most prominent contributors at <em><a href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</a></em>; these individuals deserve thanks for their ongoing efforts, which keep R alive and at the forefront of statistical computing!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The team issues updated versions of R relatively frequently. There have been substantial changes to the software over time, though neighboring versions are typically similar to one another. In this book, I’ve employed versions 3.0.1–3.2.2. You can find out what’s new in the latest version by following the NEWS link on the relevant download page (see <a href="app01.xhtml#app01">Appendix A</a>).</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="introlev1sec02"><strong>About This Book</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><em>The Book of R</em> is intended as a resource to help you get comfortable with R as a first programming language and with the statistical thought that underpins much of its use. The goal is to lay an introductory yet comprehensive foundation for understanding the computational nature of modern data science.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The structure of the book seeks to progress naturally in content, first focusing on R as a computational and programming tool and then shifting gears to discuss using R for probability, statistics, and data exploration and modeling. You’ll build your knowledge up progressively, and at the end of each chapter, you’ll find a section summarizing the important code as a quick reference.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="introlev2sec01"><strong><em>Part I: The Language</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><a href="part01.xhtml#part01">Part I</a>, which covers the fundamental syntax and object types used across all aspects of R programming, is essential for beginners. <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapters 2</a> through <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">5</a> introduce the basics of simple arithmetic, assignment, and important object types such as vectors, matrices, lists, and data frames. In <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06">Chapter 6</a>, I’ll discuss the way R represents missing data values and distinguishes among different object types. You’re given a primer on plotting in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07">Chapter 7</a>, using both built-in and contributed functionality (via the <code>ggplot2</code> package—see <a href="ref.xhtml#ref72">Wickham, 2009</a>); this chapter lays the groundwork for graphical design discussed later in the book. In <a href="ch08.xhtml#ch08">Chapter 8</a>, I’ll cover the fundamentals of reading data in from external files, essential for analysis of your own collected data.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="introlev2sec02"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxix"/><strong><em>Part II: Programming</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><a href="part02.xhtml#part02">Part II</a> focuses on getting you familiar with common R programming mechanisms. First, I’ll discuss functions and how they work in R in <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09">Chapter 9</a>. Then, in <a href="ch10.xhtml#ch10">Chapter 10</a>, I’ll cover loops and conditional statements, which are used to control the flow, repetition, and execution of your code, before teaching you how to write your own executable R functions in <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11</a>. The examples in these two chapters are designed primarily to help you understand the behavior of these mechanisms rather than to present real-world analyses. I’ll also cover some additional topics, such as error handling and measuring function execution time, in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12">Chapter 12</a>.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="introlev2sec03"><strong><em>Part III: Statistics and Probability</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">With a firm handle on R as a language, you’ll shift your attention to statistical thinking in <a href="part03.xhtml#part03">Part III</a>. In <a href="ch13.xhtml#ch13">Chapter 13</a>, you’ll look at important terminology used to describe variables; elementary summary statistics such as the mean, variance, quantiles, and correlation; and how these statistics are implemented in R. Turning again to plotting, <a href="ch14.xhtml#ch14">Chapter 14</a> covers how to visually explore your data (with both built-in and <code>ggplot2</code> functionality) by using and customizing common statistical plots such as histograms and box-and-whisker plots. <a href="ch15.xhtml#ch15">Chapter 15</a> gives an overview of the concepts of probability and random variables, and then you’ll look at the R implementation and statistical interpretation of some common probability distributions in <a href="ch16.xhtml#ch16">Chapter 16</a>.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="introlev2sec04"><strong><em>Part IV: Statistical Testing and Modeling</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In <a href="part04.xhtml#part04">Part IV</a>, you’re introduced to statistical hypothesis testing and linear regression models. <a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17">Chapter 17</a> introduces sampling distributions and confidence intervals. <a href="ch18.xhtml#ch18">Chapter 18</a> details hypothesis testing and <em>p</em>-values and demonstrates implementation and interpretation using R; the common ANOVA procedure is then discussed in <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19">Chapter 19</a>. In <a href="ch20.xhtml#ch20">Chapters 20</a> and <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21">21</a>, you’ll explore linear regression modeling in detail, including model fitting and dealing with different types of predictor variables, inferring and predicting, and dealing with variable transformation and interactive effects. Rounding off <a href="part04.xhtml#part04">Part IV</a>, <a href="ch22.xhtml#ch22">Chapter 22</a> discusses methods for selecting an appropriate linear model and assessing the validity of that model with various diagnostic tools.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Linear regression represents just one class of parametric models and is a natural starting point for learning about statistical regression. Similarly, the R syntax and output used to fit, summarize, predict from, and diagnose linear models of this kind are much the same for other regression models—so once you’re comfortable with these chapters, you’ll be ready to tackle the R implementation of more complicated models covered in more advanced texts with relative ease.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxx"/><a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Parts III</a> and <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">IV</a> represent much of what you’d expect to see in first- and second-year college statistics courses. My aim is to keep mathematical details to a minimum and focus on implementation and interpretation. I’ll provide references to other resources where necessary if you’re interested in looking more closely at the underlying theory.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="introlev2sec05"><strong><em>Part V: Advanced Graphics</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The final part looks at some more advanced graphing skills. <a href="ch23.xhtml#ch23">Chapter 23</a> shows you how to customize traditional R graphics, from handling the graphics devices themselves to controlling the finer aspects of your plot’s appearance. In <a href="ch24.xhtml#ch24">Chapter 24</a>, you’ll study the popular <code>ggplot2</code> package further, looking at more advanced features such as adding smooth scatterplot trends and producing multiple plots via faceting. The final two chapters concentrate on higher dimensional plotting in R. <a href="ch25.xhtml#ch25">Chapter 25</a> covers color handling and 3D surface preparation before discussing contour plots, perspective plots, and pixel images with the aid of multiple examples. <a href="ch26.xhtml#ch26">Chapter 26</a> then focuses on interactive plots and includes some simple instructions for plotting multivariate parametric equations.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Though not strictly necessary, it’s helpful to have some familiarity with the linear regression methods discussed in <a href="part04.xhtml#part04">Part IV</a> before tackling <a href="part05.xhtml#part05">Part V</a>, since some of the examples in this last part use fitted linear models.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="introlev1sec03"><strong>For Students</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Like many, I first started becoming proficient in R programming and the associated implementation of various statistical methods when I began my graduate studies (at Massey University in Palmerston North, New Zealand). Building on little more than the odd line or two of code I’d encountered during my undergraduate years in Australia, being “thrown in the deep end” had both benefits and drawbacks. While the immersion accelerated my progress, not knowing what to do when things don’t work properly is of course frustrating.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>The Book of R</em> thus represents the introduction to the language that I wish I’d had when I began exploring R, combined with the first-year fundamentals of statistics as a discipline, implemented in R. With this book, you’ll be able to build a well-rounded foundation for using R, both as a programming language and as a tool for statistical analyses.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This book was written to be read cover to cover, like a story (albeit with no plot twists!). Ideas are built up progressively within each part of the book, so you can choose to begin either right at the start or where you feel your level of knowledge currently stands. With that in mind, I offer the following recommendation to students of R:</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• Try not to be afraid of R. It will do exactly what you tell it to—nothing more, nothing less. When something doesn’t work as expected or an <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxxi"/>error occurs, this literal behavior works in your favor. Look carefully at the commands line by line and try to narrow down the instructions that caused the fault.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• Attempt the practice exercises in this book and check your responses using the suggested solutions—these are all available as R script files on the book’s website, <em><a href="https://www.nostarch.com/bookofr/">https://www.nostarch.com/bookofr/</a></em>. Download the <em>.zip</em> file and extract the <em>.R</em> files, one for each part of the book. Open these in your R session, and you can run the lines like you would any R code to see the output. The short practice exercises are intended to be exactly that—practice—as opposed to being hard or insurmountable challenges. Everything you need to know to complete them will be contained in the preceding sections of that chapter.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• Especially in your early stages of learning, when you’re away from this book, try to use R for everything, even for very simple tasks or calculations you might usually do elsewhere. This will force your mind to switch to “R mode” more often, and it’ll get you comfortable with the environment quickly.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="introlev1sec04"><strong>For Instructors</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This book was designed from a three-day workshop, Introduction to R, that I run at my current institution—the Department of Mathematics &amp; Statistics at the University of Otago in New Zealand—as part of our Statistics Workshops for Postgraduates and Staff (SWoPS). Succeeded by the SWoPS class Statistical Modelling 1 run by two of my colleagues, the aim of Introduction to R is, as the title suggests, to address the programming side of things. Your coverage will naturally depend on your target audience.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here I provide some recommendations for using the content in <em>The Book of R</em> for workshops of similar length to our SWoPS series. Particular chapters can be added or dropped depending on your target workshop duration and students’ existing knowledge.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• <strong>Programming Introduction</strong>: <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Parts I</a> and <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">II</a>. Selected material from <a href="part05.xhtml#part05">Part V</a>, especially <a href="ch23.xhtml#ch23">Chapter 23</a> (Advanced Plot Customization), might also suit the scope of such a course.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• <strong>Statistics Introduction</strong>: <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Parts III</a> and <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">IV</a>. If a brief introduction to R is warranted beforehand, consider dropping, for example, <a href="ch13.xhtml#ch13">Chapter 13</a> from <a href="part03.xhtml#part03">Part III</a> and <a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17">Chapters 17</a> through <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19">19</a> in <a href="part04.xhtml#part04">Part IV</a> and building an initial foundation from content in <a href="part01.xhtml#part01">Part I</a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• <strong>Intermediate Programming and Statistics</strong>: <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Parts II</a> and <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">IV</a>. Consider dropping <a href="ch17.xhtml#ch17">Chapters 17</a> through <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19">19</a> from <a href="part04.xhtml#part04">Part IV</a> to include <a href="part05.xhtml#part05">Part V</a> if the audience is interested in developing plotting skills.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• <strong>R Graphics</strong>: <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Parts I</a> and <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">V</a>. Depending on audience knowledge, material from <a href="part01.xhtml#part01">Part I</a> may be dropped so that <a href="ch14.xhtml#ch14">Chapter 14</a> in <a href="part02.xhtml#part02">Part II</a> can be included (Basic Data Visualization).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxii"/>If you’re planning to go even further and structure a longer course around this book, the practice exercises make particularly good lecture-specific homework to keep students abreast of the skills in R and statistics as they’re developed. The main points of the sections making up each chapter are relatively easy to translate into slides that can be initially structured with help from the Contents in Detail.</p>&#13;

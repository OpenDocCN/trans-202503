<div class="image1"><img src="Images/common.jpg" alt="Image" width="189" height="189"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Electric current is electric charge in motion. The current in electric circuits, such as those in our homes and offices, consists of charge flowing along a wire, but it’s also useful to consider the possibility of charge flowing across a surface or throughout a volume. These three current distributions—line, surface, and volume—are the subject of this chapter.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This chapter parallels <a href="ch24.xhtml">Chapter 24</a> on electric charge. We’ll introduce the ideas of current, surface current density, and volume current density. We’ll then define a data type for current distribution capable of representing a line current, a surface current, a volume current, or any combination of these. As electric charge is the source of electric fields, so electric current is the source of magnetic fields. We’ll show how to calculate the magnetic dipole moment of any current distribution, and we’ll discuss similarities and differences with the electric dipole moment of a charge distribution. Having a good language for current distributions prepares us for the next chapter, in which we’ll find the magnetic field produced by a current distribution.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch26lev1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_508"/>Current Distributions</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Current is clearly an electrical phenomenon, being the flow of electric charge. But in 1820, Hans Christian Oersted showed that current was also a magnetic phenomenon, establishing the first connection between electricity and magnetism. Modern electromagnetic theory views current as the fundamental source of magnetic field.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In other words, electric current is the fundamental quantity responsible for magnetic effects (although this took thousands of years to discover after magnetic phenomena were first observed) and plays a key role in electromagnetic theory. We use three types of current distributions. First, there is current flowing along a one-dimensional path such as a line or a curve, which we often refer to simply as <em>current</em>. The SI unit for current is the ampere, or amp (A). An ampere of current in a wire means that 1 Coulomb of charge is passing a fixed point on the wire in each second. We typically use the symbol <em>I</em> for current. By convention, current is the flow of positive charge. The convention was established before people knew that it’s the negatively charged electrons in metals that are free to move and conduct current. Electrons that are flowing to the left produce a current to the right in our convention.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A second current distribution is current flowing across a two-dimensional surface. In this case, we speak of the <em>surface current density</em> <strong>K</strong>, meaning the current per unit of cross-sectional length. The SI unit for surface current density is the ampere per meter (A/m).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Lastly, there is current flowing throughout a three-dimensional volume. In this case, we speak of the <em>volume current density</em> <strong>J</strong>, meaning the current per unit of cross-sectional area. The SI unit for volume current density is the ampere per square meter (A/m<sup>2</sup>). <a href="ch26.xhtml#ch26tab1">Table 26-1</a> summarizes these current distributions.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">Let’s now turn to our Haskell code.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch26lev2">Introductory Code</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><a href="ch26.xhtml#ch26list1">Listing 26-1</a> shows the first lines of code in the <code>Current</code> module we’ll write in this chapter.</p>&#13;

<p class="listing"><em>Listing 26-1: Opening lines of code for the <code>Current</code> module</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here we’ve used types and functions from the <code>SimpleVec</code> module of <a href="ch10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, the <code>CoordinateSystems</code> module of <a href="ch22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a>, the <code>Geometry</code> module of <a href="ch23.xhtml">Chapter 23</a>, and the <code>ElectricField</code> module of <a href="ch25.xhtml">Chapter 25</a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s define a type synonym for current.</p>&#13;
<pre>type Current = R</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">This is analogous to the type synonym we made for <code>Charge</code>. It’s a simple way to create a type for current, but because <code>Current</code>, <code>Charge</code>, and <code>R</code> are all the same type, the compiler will not be able to help us from mistakenly using a <code>Charge</code> where a <code>Current</code> should go, or vice versa.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now that we’ve specified a type for current, let’s look at a type for current distribution, which will be a little more involved.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch26lev3">A Type for Current Distribution</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Just as we did with <code>ChargeDistribution</code> in <a href="ch24.xhtml">Chapter 24</a>, here we want a new data type, <code>CurrentDistribution</code>, that can hold a line current, a surface current, a volume current, or a combination of these. What information do we need to specify each of these? For a line current, we need to specify a curve along which the current flows and the numerical value of the current. A line current requires that we give a <code>Current</code> and a <code>Curve</code>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To specify a surface current, we need to give a vector field for the surface current density, which may vary from place to place, as well as a surface across which the current flows. A surface current is specified by giving a <code>VectorField</code> and a <code>Surface</code>. Similarly, a volume current is specified by giving a <code>VectorField</code> and a <code>Volume</code>. Finally, a combination of current distributions is specified by giving a list of current distributions.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at the code defining the data type <code>CurrentDistribution</code>.</p>&#13;
<pre>data CurrentDistribution&#13;
  = LineCurrent    Current    Curve&#13;
  | SurfaceCurrent VectorField Surface&#13;
  | VolumeCurrent  VectorField Volume&#13;
  | MultipleCurrents [CurrentDistribution]</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_510"/>The type <code>CurrentDistribution</code> has four data constructors, one for each situation we described earlier. To construct a <code>CurrentDistribution</code>, we use one of the four data constructors along with the relevant information for that sort of current distribution.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch26lev4">Examples of Current Distributions</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Let’s write some examples of current distributions. The current distribution for current flowing around a circular loop in the xy-plane centered at the origin is called <code>circularCurrentLoop</code>.</p>&#13;
<pre>circularCurrentLoop :: R  -- radius&#13;
                    -&gt; R  -- current&#13;
                    -&gt; CurrentDistribution&#13;
circularCurrentLoop radius i&#13;
    = LineCurrent i (Curve (\phi -&gt; cyl radius phi 0) 0 (2*pi))</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">This is one of the simplest current distributions. The function <code>circular</code> <code>CurrentLoop</code> takes a radius and a current as input, and it returns a current distribution. In the following chapter, we’ll calculate the magnetic field produced by this current distribution. A circular current loop is also an example of a magnetic dipole, which we’ll discuss later in this chapter.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A <em>solenoid</em> consists of many turns of wire around a cylindrical frame. The function <code>wireSolenoid</code> returns a current distribution when provided with a radius for the solenoid, a length for the solenoid, the number of turns of wire per unit length, and the current in the wire.</p>&#13;
<pre>wireSolenoid :: R  -- radius&#13;
             -&gt; R  -- length&#13;
             -&gt; R  -- turns/length&#13;
             -&gt; R  -- current&#13;
             -&gt; CurrentDistribution&#13;
wireSolenoid radius len n i&#13;
    = LineCurrent i (Curve (\phi -&gt; cyl radius phi (phi/(2*pi*n)))&#13;
                               (-pi*n*len) (pi*n*len))</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">The curve for the wire is a helix. We use the cylindrical coordinate <em>ϕ</em> to parameterize the curve. The z-coordinate increases as <em>ϕ</em> increases to make the helix. If <em>n</em> is the number of turns of wire per unit length, and <em>L</em> is the length, then there are <em>nL</em> turns of wire on the solenoid. To produce this number of turns, the parameter <em>ϕ</em> must go through 2<em>πnL</em> radians from start to finish. We set the limits for <em>ϕ</em> to be from – <em>πnL</em> to <em>πnL</em> so that the solenoid will be centered at the origin. We want the limits for <em>z</em> to be – <em>L</em>/2 to <em>L</em>/2; if we divide <em>ϕ</em> by 2<em>πn</em>, we will achieve this, so we use <em>ϕ</em>/2<em>πn</em> for the z-coordinate in the <code>cyl</code> function.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In a <em>sheet solenoid</em>, we imagine the turns of wire are so close together that the current is effectively a surface current. We use the same inputs to <code>sheetSolenoid</code> as we did for <code>wireSolenoid</code>.</p>&#13;
<pre><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_511"/>sheetSolenoid :: R  -- radius&#13;
              -&gt; R  -- length&#13;
              -&gt; R  -- turns/length&#13;
              -&gt; R  -- current&#13;
              -&gt; CurrentDistribution&#13;
sheetSolenoid radius len n i&#13;
    = SurfaceCurrent (\r -&gt; (n*i) *^ phiHat r)&#13;
      (Surface (\(phi,z) -&gt; cyl radius phi z)&#13;
       0 (2*pi) (const $ -len/2) (const $ len/2))</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Since the sheet solenoid is a surface current, it requires a surface current density <strong>K</strong>. Surface current density is current per unit of cross-sectional length, so we have <em>K</em> = <em>nI</em>; the magnitude of the surface current density is the current in one wire times the number of turns per unit length. The direction of the surface current density is <img class="inline" src="Images/sdcap.jpg" alt="Image" width="14" height="25"/>, so the surface current density is <img class="inline" src="Images/511equ01.jpg" alt="Image" width="77" height="25"/>, which is given in the code as <code>\r -&gt; (n*i) *^ phiHat r</code>. The surface is a cylinder, parameterized by the cylindrical coordinates <em>ϕ</em> and <em>z</em>. The limits for <em>ϕ</em> are 0 to 2<em>π</em>, although we could have chosen – <em>π</em> to <em>π</em> and achieved the same result. The limits for <em>z</em> are – <em>L</em>/2 to <em>L</em>/2. We need to use the function <code>const</code> because a surface requires limits on the second parameter that are functions of the first parameter. If the turns are close together, the wire solenoid will produce a very similar magnetic field to the sheet solenoid.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A <em>toroid</em> is formed by wrapping wire around a torus, as shown in <a href="ch26.xhtml#ch26fig1">Figure 26-1</a>.</p>&#13;

<p class="note-para"><em>Solenoids and toroids are both used in circuits as <em>inductors</em>, which are circuit elements that can help to smooth out rapid changes in voltage. For something like a light dimmer, toroids are often better because most of the magnetic field resides in the torus, which means less electromagnetic noise is spewed into the room as the magnetic field changes. The frequency of the noise is the frequency of the generated electricity (60 Hz in the US), and multiples thereof, and can produce an irritating buzzing sound, so it is good to minimize the noise.</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">The function <code>wireToroid</code> returns a current distribution when provided with a small radius for the torus, a big radius for the torus, the total number of turns, and the current in the wire.</p>&#13;
<pre>wireToroid :: R  -- small radius&#13;
           -&gt; R  -- big radius&#13;
           -&gt; R  -- number of turns&#13;

           -&gt; CurrentDistribution&#13;
wireToroid smallR bigR n i&#13;
    = let alpha phi = n * phi&#13;
          curve phi = cyl (bigR + smallR * cos (alpha phi)) phi&#13;
                      (smallR * sin (alpha phi))&#13;
      in LineCurrent i (Curve curve 0 (2*pi))</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">The toroidal curve is based on the parametrization of the torus we use in Exercise 26.3. The two parameters for the toroidal surface are the cylindrical coordinate <em>ϕ</em> and an angle <em>α</em> that advances around the small cross-sectional circle of the torus. The cylindrical coordinates of points on the torus are given in terms of the two parameters <em>ϕ</em> and <em>α</em>, as follows:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/512equ01.jpg" alt="Image" width="124" height="78"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">To make the curve for the wire toroid, we choose the cylindrical coordinate <em>ϕ</em> to be our single parameter, and we let <em>α</em> now depend on <em>ϕ</em>. We choose</p>&#13;
<p class="centere"><em>α</em>(<em>ϕ</em>) = <em>nϕ</em></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">so that <em>α</em> advances 2<em>πn</em> radians around the small circle (<em>n</em> revolutions) as <em>ϕ</em> advances 2<em>π</em> radians around the big circle (one revolution). The limits on the parameter <em>ϕ</em> are simply 0 to 2<em>π</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We’ll see the magnetic field produced by the wire toroid in the next chapter.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch26lev5">Conservation of Charge and Constraints on Steady Current Distributions</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Electric charge is conserved. This means that the total amount of charge in any isolated region stays the same over time. Actually, an even stronger <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_513"/>statement about charge conservation is true. The amount of charge in any region of space will change precisely to the extent that current flows across the boundary of the region. Current flowing into the region will increase the charge in the region while current flowing out of the region will decrease the charge.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If <em>Q</em>(<em>t</em>) is the charge in some region at time <em>t</em>, and <em>I</em>(<em>t</em>) is the current flowing out of the region at time <em>t</em>, then</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/513equ01.jpg" alt="Image" width="409" height="44"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">In other words, the rate at which charge increases in the region is the negative of the net current flowing out of the region, which is to say the net current flowing into the region.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The current flowing through any (closed or open) surface <em>S</em> by a volume current density <strong>J</strong>(<em>t</em>,<strong>r</strong>) is given by</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/513equ02.jpg" alt="Image" width="425" height="48"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">This is the same dotted surface integral, or flux integral, that we used to calculate electric flux in Exercise 25.10. Returning to our region of space with charge <em>Q</em>(<em>t</em>) and net out-flowing current <em>I</em>(<em>t</em>), we can use a time-dependent version of Equation 24.3,</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/513equ03.jpg" alt="Image" width="423" height="48"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">to rewrite Equation 26.1 in terms of charge density and current density:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/513equ04.jpg" alt="Image" width="491" height="48"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here, <em>V</em> is the region of space we are concerned with and <em>∂V</em> is the closed surface that constitutes the boundary of <em>V</em> . If we allow the region <em>V</em> to become very small, we can divide both sides of Equation 26.4 by the volume of <em>V</em> to obtain an equation known as the <em>continuity equation</em>. See [<strong><a href="bib.xhtml#bib19"><span class="green">19</span></a></strong>] for the mathematical details.</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/513equ05.jpg" alt="Image" width="442" height="44"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">The quantity ∇⋅<strong>J</strong>(<em>t</em>,<strong>r</strong>) is called the <em>divergence</em> of the current density. The divergence of a vector field is the flux of the vector field per unit volume, where the flux is calculated over the closed boundary surface of the volume, in the limit where the volume is allowed to become very small. Since divergence is flux per unit volume, a place where a vector field has positive divergence is a place that the vectors point away from. Similarly, a place where a vector field has negative divergence is a place that the vectors point toward.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The symbol ∇ is called the <em>del operator</em>, and in Cartesian coordinates it is given by</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/513equ06.jpg" alt="Image" width="435" height="49"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_514"/>The word <em>operator</em> here is used as physicists use it, meaning something that takes a function as input and produces a function as output. Functional programmers call such a thing a <em>higher-order function.</em> The combination of the del operator followed by a dot product symbol forms the divergence. In Cartesian coordinates, the divergence of a vector field looks like the following:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/514equ01.jpg" alt="Image" width="444" height="51"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">A consequence of the continuity equation is dramatically illustrated when you toss a crumpled sheet of aluminum foil into a microwave oven. The microwaves induce large currents in the foil, causing large amounts of charge to pile up in some parts of the foil. This gives rise to intense electric fields, and, finally <em>SPAAAKKKK!</em> as the electric field becomes strong enough to ionize the air and allow a spark.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Not every vector field can serve as a steady current density. In this chapter, we are interested in steady current distributions that do not change in time. If the charge density <em>ρ</em>(<em>t</em>,<strong>r</strong>) and the current density <strong>J</strong>(<em>t</em>,<strong>r</strong>) are independent of time <em>t</em>, the continuity equation demands that ∇⋅<strong>J</strong> = 0 (that is, that the current density be divergenceless). A vector field that is divergenceless is also known as a <em>solenoidal</em> vector field, from the shape of the solenoid, or pipe.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The computer will not check to make sure the vector field you use for current density is divergenceless. In this case, as in so many others when we model systems on a computer, the programmer is responsible for ensuring that the modeled system makes sense.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch26lev6">Magnetic Dipole Moment</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Just as an electric dipole moment can be associated with any charge distribution, a magnetic dipole moment can be associated with any current distribution. In fact, the analogy extends to a multipole expansion. Just as a charge distribution can be thought of as a combination of monopole, dipole, quadrupole, and higher electric multipoles, so a current distribution can be thought of as a combination of magnetic multipoles, <em>except</em> that there is never any magnetic monopole in this expansion.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="note-title"><span class="bg1">NOTE</span></p>&#13;
<p class="note-para"><em>One of the four Maxwell equations we study in <a href="ch29.xhtml">Chapter 29</a> enforces this “no magnetic monopoles” rule. A current distribution has a magnetic dipole moment in close analogy with the electric dipole moment that a charge distribution has. A current distribution also has magnetic multipole moments in analogy with the electric multipole moments that a charge distribution has. But the analogy does not extend to monopole moment. Our universe contains electric charge (electric monopole moment), but so far no one has found any magnetic charge (magnetic monopole moment).</em></p>&#13;

<p class="indent">The magnetic dipole moment is often a good simple characterization of a localized current distribution, such as a current loop, giving a good approximation for the magnetic field that the distribution creates.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The magnetic dipole moment for a line current is defined in terms of a crossed line integral, defined as follows:</p>&#13;

<p class="noindent">This chapter introduced current distributions, which are the fundamental source of magnetic field. We defined a type <code>CurrentDistribution</code>, which is capable of holding a line current, a surface current, a volume current, or a combination of these. Our simplest example of a current distribution is a wire loop. We also wrote solenoids and a toroid as examples of current distributions.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">There is a multipole expansion for a current distribution that views the current as composed of a magnetic dipole, a magnetic quadrupole, and higher terms. However, there is no magnetic monopole term in this expansion. From far away, a current distribution often looks like a magnetic dipole, so we sometimes think of the magnetic dipole as a source of a magnetic field, similar to how electric charge (monopole) and the electric dipole can be thought of as sources of electric fields.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">With the code we wrote in this chapter, we can now calculate the magnetic dipole moment associated with any current distribution. In the next chapter, we’ll show how to compute the magnetic field produced by a current distribution.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch26lev8">Exercises</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Exercise 26.1.</strong> A <em>Helmholtz coil</em> consists of two circular loops of wire, parallel to each other and sharing the same central axis, that each carry a current <em>I</em> in the same direction. The loops each have radius <em>R</em> and are separated by a distance equal to the radius <em>R</em>. This particular value of separation allows for a rather uniform magnetic field at the center of the Helmholtz coil. Write a current distribution for the Helmholtz coil.</p>&#13;
<pre>helmholtzCoil :: R  -- radius&#13;
              -&gt; R  -- current&#13;
              -&gt; CurrentDistribution&#13;
helmholtzCoil radius i = undefined radius i</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">In practice, many loops of wire are coiled at the location of each of the two circles so that a moderate current through the wire will produce the effect of a very large current around each single loop.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Exercise 26.2.</strong> A simple and popular current distribution is an infinitely long straight wire carrying current <em>I</em>. It is not convenient for us to write a current distribution for an infinitely long wire, so let’s give the wire length as a parameter. Write a current distribution for a long straight wire.</p>&#13;
<pre>longStraightWire :: R  -- wire length&#13;
                 -&gt; R  -- current&#13;
                 -&gt; CurrentDistribution&#13;
longStraightWire len i = undefined len i</pre>&#13;
<p class="noindentts"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_517"/><strong>Exercise 26.3.</strong> If the turns of wire in a toroid are very close together, we can well approximate the current distribution by a surface current. Write a current distribution for a sheet toroid, similar to our sheet solenoid from earlier. Here is a torus to get you started. The function <code>torus</code> takes a small radius and a big radius as input.</p>&#13;
<pre>torus :: R -&gt; R -&gt; Surface&#13;
torus smallR bigR&#13;
    = Surface (\(phi,alpha) -&gt; cyl (bigR + smallR * cos alpha) phi&#13;
                               (smallR * sin alpha))&#13;
      0 (2*pi) (const 0) (const $ 2*pi)</pre>&#13;
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Exercise 26.4.</strong> Consider a solenoid that has so much wire wrapped around it that it has become fat. The wire on the inside is a distance <em>a</em> from the central axis, and the wire on the outside is a distance <em>b</em> from the central axis (<em>a</em> &lt; <em>b</em>). We model this with a volume current density <img class="inline" src="Images/517equ02.jpg" alt="Image" width="77" height="26"/> in the region <em>a</em> &lt; <em>s</em> &lt; <em>b</em>, where <em>J</em><sub>0</sub> is a constant. Outside of this region, there is no current. The length of the solenoid is <em>L</em>. Write a current distribution for the fat solenoid.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Exercise 26.5.</strong> For a steady current density that does not change with time, we can write Equation 26.2 without the time dependence as follows:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/517equ01.jpg" alt="Image" width="407" height="48"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Write a function that calculates the total current flowing through a surface.</p>&#13;
<pre>totalCurrent :: VectorField  -- volume current density&#13;
             -&gt; Surface&#13;
             -&gt; Current      -- total current through surface&#13;
totalCurrent j s = undefined j s<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_518"/></pre>&#13;

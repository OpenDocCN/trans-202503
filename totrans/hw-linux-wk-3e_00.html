<p class="BodyFirst">Your system shouldn’t be a mystery. You should be able to make your software do what you want it to do without “magic” incantations or rituals. The key to attaining this power lies in understanding the fundamentals of what the software does and how it works, and that’s what this book is all about. You should never have to fight with a computer.</p>
<p>Linux is a great platform for learning because it doesn’t try to hide anything from you. In particular, you can find most system configuration details in easy-to-read plaintext files. The only tricky part is figuring out which parts are responsible for what and how they all fit together.</p>
<h2 id="h1-500402f06-0001">Who Should Read This Book?</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Your interest in learning how Linux works may have come from any number of sources. In the professional realm, operations and DevOps folks need to know nearly everything that you’ll find in this book. Linux software architects and developers should also know this material in order to make the best use of the operating system. Researchers and students, often running their own Linux systems, will also find that this book provides useful explanations for <em>why</em> things are set up the way they are.</p>
<p>Then there are the tinkerers—people who just love to play around with their computers for fun, profit, or both. Want to know why certain things work while others don’t? Want to know what happens if you move something around? You’re probably a tinkerer.</p>
<h2 id="h1-500402f06-0002"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xxii" id="Page_xxii"/>Prerequisites</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Although Linux is beloved by programmers, you don’t need to be a programmer to read this book; you need only basic computer-user knowledge. That is, you should be able to bumble around a GUI (especially the installer and settings interface for a Linux distribution) and know what files and directories (folders) are. You should also be prepared to check additional documentation on your system and on the web. The most important thing you need is to be ready and willing to play around with your computer.</p>
<h2 id="h1-500402f06-0003">How to Read This Book</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Building the requisite knowledge is a challenge in tackling any technical subject. Explaining how software systems work can get <em>really</em> complicated. Too much detail can bog down readers and make important concepts difficult to grasp (the human brain just can’t process so many new ideas at once), but too little detail can leave readers in the dark and unprepared for later material.</p>
<p>I’ve designed most chapters to tackle the most important material first: the basic information that you’ll need in order to progress. In places, I’ve simplified things in order to keep focus. As a chapter progresses, you’ll see much more detail, especially in the last few sections. Do you need to know those bits right away? In most cases, no; I note this where applicable. If your eyes start to glaze over when you’re faced with a lot of extra details about concepts you just learned, don’t hesitate to skip ahead to the next chapter or take a break. The nitty-gritty will still be there waiting for you.</p>
<h2 id="h1-500402f06-0004">A Hands-on Approach</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">However you choose to proceed through this book, you should have a Linux machine in front of you, preferably one that you’re confident abusing with experiments. You might prefer to play around with a virtual installation—I used VirtualBox to test much of the material in this book. You also should have superuser (root) access, but try to use a regular user account most of the time. You’ll mostly work at the command line, in a terminal window or a remote session. If you haven’t worked much in that environment, no problem; <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 2">Chapter 2</span> will bring you up to speed.</p>
<p>Commands in this book typically look like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ <b>ls /</b>
[some output]</code></pre>
<p>Enter the text in bold; the nonbolded text that follows is what the machine spits back. The <code>$</code> is the prompt for a regular user account. If you see a <code>#</code> as a prompt, you need to be superuser. (More on that in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 2">Chapter 2</span>.)</p>
<h2 id="h1-500402f06-0005"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xxiii" id="Page_xxiii"/>How This Book Is Organized</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">I’ve grouped the book’s chapters into three basic parts. The first is introductory, giving a bird’s-eye view of the system and then offering hands-on experience with some tools you’ll need for as long as you run Linux. Next, you’ll explore each part of the system in more detail, from device management to network configuration, following the general order in which the system starts. Finally, you’ll get a tour of some pieces of a running system, learn some essential skills, and get some insight into the tools that programmers use.</p>
<p>With the exception of <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 2">Chapter 2</span>, most of the early chapters heavily involve the Linux kernel, but you’ll work your way into user space as the book progresses. (If you don’t know what I’m talking about here, don’t worry; I’ll explain in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 1">Chapter 1</span>.)</p>
<p>The material is meant to be as distribution-agnostic as possible. Having said this, it can be tedious to cover all variations in systems software, so I’ve tried to cover the two major distribution families: Debian (including Ubuntu) and RHEL/Fedora/CentOS. I’ve also focused on desktop and server installations. A significant amount of material carries over into embedded systems, such as Android and OpenWRT, but it’s up to you to discover the differences on those platforms.</p>
<h2 id="h1-500402f06-0006">What’s New in the Third Edition?</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The second edition was published during a time of transition for Linux systems. Several traditional components were in the process of being replaced, which made handling some subjects tricky, because readers could encounter a wide variety of configurations. Now, however, those new pieces (systemd in particular) have near-universal adoption, so I’ve been able to streamline a fair amount of the discussion.</p>
<p>I’ve retained the emphasis on the kernel’s role in a Linux system. This material has proven popular, and you probably interact with the kernel more than you realize.</p>
<p>I’ve added a new chapter introducing virtualization. Although Linux has always been popular on virtual machines (such as cloud services), that type of virtualization lies outside the scope of this book, because the way the system operates on a virtual machine is almost the same as on “bare metal” hardware. So, the discussion here primarily focuses on deciphering the terminology you’ll encounter. However, containers have gained in popularity since the second edition was published, and they also fit here, because they basically consist of a bunch of Linux features like the ones described throughout the rest of the book. Containers make heavy use of cgroups, which also get new treatment in this third edition.</p>
<p>Other subjects (not necessarily related to containers) I happily expanded on are the Logical Volume Manager, the journald logging system, and IPv6 in the networking material.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xxiv" id="Page_xxiv"/>Though I’ve added a significant amount of content, the book is still a reasonable size. I want to provide the information you need to get on the fast track, and that includes explaining certain details along the way that can be hard to grasp, but I don’t want you to have to become a weightlifter in order to pick up this book. Once you master the important subjects here, you should have no trouble seeking out and understanding more details.</p>
<p>The first edition included historical information that I removed later to improve focus. If you’re interested in Linux and how it relates to the history of Unix, pick up Peter H. Salus’s <em>The Daemon, the Gnu, and the Penguin</em> (Reed Media Services, 2008). It does a great job of explaining how the software we use has evolved over time.</p>
<h2 id="h1-500402f06-0007">A Note on Terminology</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The names of certain operating system elements have caused a fair amount of debate historically—even the word <em>Linux</em> itself. Should it be “Linux,” or should it be “GNU/Linux” to reflect that the operating system also contains pieces from the GNU Project? Throughout this book, I’ve tried to use the most common, least awkward names possible. </p>

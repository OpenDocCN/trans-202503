- en: Many books teach you how to do artificial intelligence (AI). Similarly, many
    popular books tell you about AI. However, what seems to be missing is a book that
    teaches you how AI works at a conceptual level. AI isn’t magic; you can understand
    what it’s doing without burying yourself in complex mathematics.

- en: This book fills that void with a math-free explanation of how AI works. While
    some books are down in the weeds and others offer a bird’s-eye view, this book
    is at treetop level. It aims to provide you with enough detail to understand the
    approach without getting bogged down in nitty-gritty mathematics. If that piques
    your interest, I invite you to read on.

    highlight a shift in the topic or a transition point. In a textbook, **** would
    indicate a new section, but this isn’t a textbook, nor do I want it to feel like
    one; so, instead of sections and subsections, I’ll use asterisks to warn you that
    a change is coming. Like this . . .

    course of the same name. What people typically mean by *AI* has changed somewhat
    over the intervening decades. Still, the goal remains the same: to mimic intelligent
    behavior in a machine.'

    aware of it. AI had minimal impact on their daily lives, beyond the occasional
    renegade computer in science fiction TV shows and movies like *Star Trek* or *WarGames*,
    to say nothing of the relentless and terrifying *Terminator*.

- en: However, the 1980s are long gone, current retro fashion trends notwithstanding,
    and AI is everywhere. It affects our lives in numerous ways every day, from phones
    telling us to drive here and not there, to labeling friends and family in pictures,
    to the articles and ads fed to us continuously online, like it or not. And this
    is to say nothing of the recent AI explosion involving large language models,
    which many interpret as “true AI” at last.

    planning, shipping and logistics, factory automation, satellite imaging of the

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book answers that question by explaining what happened, when it happened,
    why it happened, and, most importantly, how it happened—all without hype or a
    single mathematical equation. Frankly, the reality behind the AI revolution is
    impressive enough; the hype is unnecessary.

    you to join me on a journey through the world of AI, so it’s reasonable to wonder
    about your guide. I certainly would.

    in AI, in the subfield known as [*machine learning*](glossary.xhtml#glo64), in
    2003, applying machine learning models to intravascular ultrasound images.

    is a subfield of machine learning. I’ll clarify the difference between deep learning,
    machine learning, and artificial intelligence in [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml), but
    for now you can think of them as the same thing.

    what came to be called AlexNet and a curious experiment at Google involving computers
    that learned to identify cats in YouTube videos. I was in the room at the 2012
    International Conference on Machine Learning in Edinburgh, Scotland, when Google
    presented its paper. It was standing room only for the conference’s 800 or so
    attendees.

    of Colorado, Boulder, under the direction of Michael Mozer. I’ve worked in AI
    daily since then, primarily in the defense industry, with a short break in 2016
    to help co-found a medical AI startup.

- en: After AlexNet, things changed quickly, as seemingly monthly some new AI-related
    “miracle” appeared in the academic literature, if not on the evening news. The
    only way to keep up was to attend conferences multiple times per year; waiting
    for results to appear in an academic journal was pointless, as the field was progressing
    too rapidly for the typically slow pace of academic publishing.

- en: I’m writing this preface in November 2022 at the NeurIPS conference. NeurIPS
    is arguably the premier AI conference (no hate emails, please!), and this is the
    first time it’s been held in person since the COVID-19 pandemic. Attendance is
    high, though perhaps not as high as at the 2019 conference, for which a lottery
    was held to determine which 13,500 people could attend. The fact that conference
    attendance has blossomed from a few hundred to over 10,000 in a decade tells us
    how important AI research has become.

    are prime hunting grounds for graduate students, also reveal the significance
    of AI. You’ll find expo booths for Google, DeepMind (also Google), Meta (read:
    Facebook), Amazon, Apple, and others. AI drives much of what these companies do.
    AI is big bucks. AI runs on data, and these companies gobble up all the data we
    freely give them in exchange for their services.'

    approaches: generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models. GANs
    provide the intuition we need to explore diffusion models and, in [Chapter 7](ch07.xhtml),
    large language models (LLMs). Diffusion models are adept at producing detailed,
    photorealistic images and videos from text prompts.'

    (2021) and *Math for Deep Learning: What You Need to Know to Understand Neural

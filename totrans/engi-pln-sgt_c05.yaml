    into the history of just about every country in the world. In the United States,
    railroads fueled enormous expansion and economic growth, perhaps more than any
    other technology in the 19th century. Today, railroads continue to serve as a
    vital mode for moving freight and people from place to place.

- en: Railways take advantage of two features to provide rapid and efficient transportation
    of people and goods. First, the steel wheels on steel rails waste little energy
    to friction (especially compared to rubber tires on asphalt). Locomotives may
    look huge, but their engines are almost trivial compared to the enormous weight
    they move. If your car were so efficient, it could run off a tiny string-trimmer
    engine. Second, and more important, railways run along dedicated rights of way,
    relatively direct and unobstructed paths that are not affected by motor vehicle
    traffic. These reserved tracks create a level of reliability that is hard to match
    with other modes of travel.

    enthusiasts around the world (often self-described as *railfans*). Whether it’s
    due to nostalgia for an earlier era or the simple appeal of seeing large machinery
    up close, enjoying the details of railroads is a passion for many, and there is
    much to enjoy. Perhaps more than the trains themselves, the paths they travel
    along are full of noteworthy particulars ripe for observation and appreciation.

    quickly and smoothly to its destination. The most distinct aspect of a railway
    is the rail itself, which supports the tremendous weight of trains and cargo.
    Rails are made from high-quality steel to withstand these incredible stresses.
    Look closely, and you can often note markings on the rail web that list the year
    of manufacture and other details about how each rail was made. Rails can be of
    different sizes and shapes, but they mostly follow a similar form: an I-shape
    with a bulbous head upon which wheels ride and a flat foot attached to the ties.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The force required to move a train forward is transferred into the rail through
    friction with the driven wheels of the locomotive. Incredibly, the contact patch
    between each wheel and the rail is only the size of a small coin. That means an
    average freight train sits on an area of steel roughly the size of this book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Historically, lengths of rail were bolted together using fishplates. The joint
    between each section creates the iconic click-clack sound as the wheels of the
    train pass over the small gap. These small but frequent discontinuities generate
    wear and tear on the railway vehicles (called rolling stock) and are uncomfortable
    for passengers. Most modern tracks use welded rails to create continuous stretches
    of smooth-running track with no joints.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One challenge of eliminating these gaps is thermal movement. Steel contracts
    with low temperatures and expands with heat. Where many structures provide freedom
    to move using expansion joints, tracks with continuously welded rail restrain
    this thermal movement. On cold days, the rails experience tensile stress as they
    try to contract. On warm days, they undergo compressive stress as they try to
    expand from their restraints. At some point in between, called the *neutral temperature*,
    the rail is free of thermal stresses. If the ambient temperature deviates too
    far from the neutral temperature, the stresses can exceed the track’s strength.
    On scorching days, railways can buckle (also called sun kink), creating the danger
    of a derailment. Rails are often warmed or stretched before installation to mitigate
    the possibility of buckling. This technique raises the neutral temperature of
    the rail so that hot days don’t overload it with thermal stress.

- en: 'There are many ways to attach the rail to the horizontal ties (also called
    sleepers). Historically, a large steel spike with an offset head was hammered
    in place to secure each side of the rail. These spikes are still used on some
    railroads in the United States. More modern railways use one of many types of
    heavy-duty clips. In North America, ties are usually made from wood because of
    its abundance, but they can be made from concrete as well. Ties have two essential
    jobs: bear the weight of loads from the train traffic above and keep the two rails
    running with the correct space between (called the track gauge). Wooden ties often
    include a tie plate to distribute the concentrated force of the rail.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maintaining an accurate gauge is critical because of the way trains stay on
    the tracks. You might think a train would struggle to navigate around a bend with
    a solid axle because the outside wheel would need to turn farther than the inside
    wheel. Cars use a *differential* between the drive wheels so they can rotate independently
    around curves. Rolling stock gets around this problem by using conical wheels.
    When the train goes around a bend, each axle shifts, so the outside wheel rides
    on a larger radius and the inner wheel on a smaller radius. This compensates for
    the difference in travel distance between the inside and outside of the curve.
    The wheel’s flange is only a safety feature to keep it on a track that is damaged
    or out of alignment. During regular operation, it shouldn’t touch the rail at
    all.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Railroad ties do not sit directly on the ground below the track, called the
    subgrade. The soils are rarely strong enough to bear the immense weight of train
    traffic. Instead, an embankment of loose rock called ballast is used to spread
    the load evenly to the underlying soil. Ballast is often made from crushed stone
    because the angular features help it interlock into a solid foundation. Not only
    does it distribute the vertical forces from the track, but ballast also provides
    horizontal support to each tie, helping resist buckling due to thermal stress
    and shifting from horizontal train forces around bends. Many embankments have
    raised shoulders to provide extra resistance against lateral forces in each tie.
    The open spaces within the stone ballast allow water to flow freely through (instead
    of ponding up along the sides).

- en: 'The geometry of railways is a critical component in their design. Railroads
    can use a much narrower right of way than a highway because they don’t need large,
    clear zones on each side of the travel lanes. However, trains require much gentler
    curves and grades than can be navigated by motor vehicles. Couplers between cars
    can’t handle sharp bends. Also, the centripetal force around curves can create
    undue stress on passengers and cargo. One solution to this problem is similar
    to a feature used on highways: raise the outside rail so that the train leans
    into curves. This tilting, also called superelevation or *cant*, reduces the horizontal
    force felt by the train.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As for vertical alignment, trains do not have enough traction on steel rails
    to brake effectively on steep slopes. Significant uphill gradients also cause
    trains to slow down, reducing the capacity of the railway. Next time you’re driving
    parallel to a railway, watch the tracks as you travel. Although the road will
    often follow the natural ground closely, the tracks will maintain a much more
    consistent elevation with only gradual changes in slope.

- en: The number of tracks is another essential consideration in railway design. A
    single track is less expensive to build and maintain than two but has some disadvantages.
    Most important, trains traveling in opposite directions must have a way to pass
    each other. A siding (or *passing loop*) is a short section of parallel track
    that allows trains to pass. The capacity of a single-track railroad depends on
    the number of these sidings. Careful scheduling can maximize the use of the single
    track, but two or more tracks dramatically increase the railway’s capacity and
    reliability.

    traffic flow. After all, there aren’t many opportunities for decision-making when
    you can move in only one of two directions. However, efficient use of a railroad
    requires that many trains must share the same tracks. Allowing trains to interact
    and navigate around each other requires some ingenuity precisely because railways
    are so constrained to a single dimension.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One significant challenge to managing railway traffic is the considerable distance
    required to stop a fully loaded train. Unlike motor vehicles whose drivers see
    and respond to hazards in real time, a train can take more than a mile to reach
    a complete stop. If a train operator can see an obstruction on the tracks while
    traveling at full speed, it is already too late. Trains sharing a railway need
    to maintain enough distance between each other to stop as required without the
    potential for collision, and they need to keep this distance without relying on
    the vision of the train crews.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Over the years, many solutions to multi-train traffic management have been used.
    The earliest method was simply to establish a timetable of when and where each
    train should be at any time of the day. The apparent limitation of this system
    is the possibility of a train breaking down or encountering a problem that prevents
    it from following the schedule. In the best case, a breakdown would delay all
    the other trains on the line, and in the worst case, it could lead to a crash.
    Most modern railway traffic control schemes are instead based on a block system.
    The tracks are subdivided into segments (called blocks), and trains are prevented
    from entering any specific block until it is free from obstructions. For non-signalized
    railways, traffic can be managed through *warrants*. A dispatcher provides a standardized
    authorization to the crew for specific train movements on the main tracks. However,
    most heavily trafficked lines use signals as the primary means of controlling
    traffic between blocks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just like a traffic signal on a roadway (as discussed in Chapter 3), railway
    signals tell the train operator when it’s safe to proceed. In fact, many railway
    signals use combinations of lights to provide further information about the routes
    and speed limits ahead. Even in North America, many railways use different standards,
    so interpreting the meaning of their signals can take some work. The simplest
    signals are those between blocks, which usually have a single signal head with
    three lights—green, yellow, and red—similar to those used at roadway intersections.
    A green light means the following blocks are clear and the train can continue
    at full speed. Yellow indicates that the next block is clear, but the one after
    is obstructed, and the next signal will indicate stop. A red light means the next
    block is occupied, and the train cannot proceed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some signals are controlled by a dispatcher, but many operate automatically
    using *track circuits*. In the most basic configurations, a low-voltage electric
    current is introduced into the rails at one end of the block. At the other end,
    a relay measures the current to control the nearby signals. When a train enters
    a block, the wheels and axles create a conductive path between the rails, shorting
    the circuit and de-energizing the relay. Insulating joints are installed between
    each track block to ensure that adjacent signals aren’t inadvertently triggered.
    A nonconductive material is used to attach two sections of rail while keeping
    them electrically isolated. Modern track circuits can even provide information
    about the location and velocity of each train. The relays, electronics, and batteries
    used to control the signals are usually hidden inside enclosures called signal
    bungalows.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Beyond block signals, multiple signal heads and light combinations carrying
    various meanings add even more complexity. The busiest companies use centralized
    traffic control offices that operate like air traffic controllers to coordinate
    the schedules and routing so that conflicts are avoided. Modern traffic systems
    provide warnings and information inside the cab of each train, reducing the possibility
    of human error. In addition, the most sophisticated signal systems allow trains
    to communicate their positions to each other so the blocks can travel along with
    the train, rather than being static stretches of track on a map.

- en: Another vital element of railway traffic management is movement between tracks.
    Trains often need to pass one another, divert to destinations off the main line,
    and swap cars and compartments in rail yards. Without a way to transition between
    railways, trains would be forever stuck on a single track, making these tasks
    impossible. Switches (also known as *turnouts*) provide the means for trains to
    change tracks. The most basic type of switch uses two flexible tapered rails called
    points. The train wheels are guided in one of two directions, depending on which
    of the two points is contacting the nonmoving stock rail. A connecting rod below
    the track attaches the points to a mechanism that selects the train direction.
    Sometimes a switchstand with a lever that a rail employee must throw manually
    controls the switch. Alternatively, a dispatcher may control the switch remotely
    using an electromechanical *switch machine*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once past the points, the train wheels navigate onto one of the two tracks.
    However, before reaching the main track, the left wheel must cross the right rail
    of the opposite track or vice versa. These crossings require a gap in the rail
    through which the wheel flanges can pass, a task accomplished with a frog. The
    crossing wheel is handed off from one of the closure rails to the frog  as the
    flange passes through the gap. Adjacent to the frog are guard rails. These run
    parallel to the main rails to keep wheels in alignment and protect against derailment.
    You can also see guard rails used on sharp curves and along bridges.

- en: When two tracks cross each other without a connection between, a diamond is
    installed. These crossings consist of four frogs to allow each wheel to traverse
    both rails of the intersecting tracks. Both switches and diamonds receive a significant
    amount of wear and tear from regular train traffic. When they cross over gaps
    and joints, wheels generate massive impact forces that can damage the rolling
    stock and the railway itself. As a result, switches and crossings receive extra
    attention from inspectors to reduce the likelihood of a failure that could lead
    to a derailment.

    but between those empty stretches are the city centers they connect. The closer
    a railroad gets to a populated place, the more conflicts with other infrastructure
    it encounters. Most important, railroads are an impediment to the flow of pedestrian
    and vehicular traffic. Some roads and railways use bridges to cross each other
    without interruption, but many intersect at the same level. These grade crossings
    are where the average person is most likely to encounter a railway. Trains moving
    at full speed cannot stop within the sight distance of an operator, and they can’t
    swerve to avoid a hazard either. For those reasons, they always have the right
    of way at crossings. Pedestrians and motor vehicles must stop and wait for trains
    to pass, so grade crossings include many safety features to decrease the potential

    into two categories: passive and active. *Passive warning devices* are those that
    do not change when a train is approaching. They include a stop or yield sign and
    a crossbuck, the international symbol for a railway crossing that consists of
    two slats in an X formation. When more than one rail is present, a supplementary
    plate states the number of tracks at the intersection. A crossbuck is often included
    as a pavement marking to make sure drivers know the tracks are coming up. Many
    low-traffic grade crossings use only passive safety features. It is the driver’s

    devices at grade crossings are hidden inside enclosures, often called signal bungalows.

    to flash, letting motorists know they need to stop. If the roadway has multiple
    lanes, the crossing may include a second pair of warning lights mounted overhead

    across the oncoming lanes when a train crosses the roadway. The gates are equipped

    Many intersections include a central median to discourage drivers from going around
    the gate. At the highest-risk crossings, exit gates are often installed for the
    same reason. They operate on a delay to avoid trapping a vehicle on the tracks.
    Most grade crossing gates are designed to provide a visual warning, but they aren’t
    strong enough to hold back an errant vehicle. At crossings of high-speed trains,
    a more robust *barrier gate* may be installed.

    are present near the railway. Red lights form a *queue* of vehicles that can back
    up across the tracks. You should never proceed across a railway until you know
    it’s clear on the other side. Still, drivers queueing at a traffic signal often
    misjudge the available space and find themselves inadvertently stopped right on
    top of the tracks. Traffic signals at busy intersections near grade crossings
    are usually coordinated with automatic warning devices. When a train is approaching,
    the signal goes green to clear the queue blocking the tracks.
  prefs: []

- en: A key consideration in the design of grade crossings is the *warning time* between
    the activation of devices and the train’s arrival at the intersection. Engineers
    need to provide enough time for vehicles to clear the tracks or stop, but not
    so much that impatient motorists assume the devices are malfunctioning and try
    to bypass the gates. People are naturally distrustful of automatic equipment,
    and that wariness is only reinforced when signals take too long to operate or
    interrupt a journey for no good reason. Engineers consider the volume and types
    of traffic, the proximity of signalized intersections, the number of tracks, and
    many other factors to strike a careful balance. The most sophisticated track circuits
    can estimate the speed of a train to make sure that warning times aren’t too long
    and can even cancel the warning if a train stops before it reaches the crossing.

    When a malfunction or loss of power occurs, the device reverts to the safest condition

    batteries to power the flashing lights and bells. Counterweights are carefully
    adjusted so that the gates will automatically fall when the electricity isn’t

    complex transmission systems that would otherwise be required to drive the wheels
    directly from an engine. With the relative simplicity of delivering electricity
    across long distances, it is natural to wonder why an onboard engine is necessary

- en: Electrifying a railway has many advantages. First, trains don’t have to carry
    the weight of large engines and the enormous volume of fuel they require. They
    are generally faster and more efficient than their diesel counterparts. Removing
    the engine also removes its exhaust, improving air quality. This feature is particularly
    important for trains that run through tunnels or subway systems where engine fumes
    could concentrate to dangerous levels. Nearly all rapid transit systems use electric
    railways. Finally, electric trains are capable of regenerating electricity upon
    braking. Instead of converting the kinetic energy into wasted heat with brakes,
    the electric motors can act as generators, transforming it back into electricity
    that other trains on the railway can use. On rapid transit, where trains decelerate
    quickly, *regenerative energy* comes in short bursts, reducing its usefulness
    to other trains. However, in areas with many hills, it can be a boon. In an ideal
    situation, much of the energy a train uses to climb a large hill can be returned
    to the system as it descends to be used by other trains.

    it’s easy to change the speed of a DC motor with simple equipment in the cab.
    However, low-voltage direct current cannot travel far in conductors without significant
    losses, so most DC railways require regularly spaced substations to convert grid
    power to direct current along the length of the track. Alternating current can

    elaborate, and its cost is the key reason that longer and lower-volume railways

    a train: a third rail or an overhead line. Third rail systems use an energized
    conductor that runs along the track parallel to the main rails. The energized
    rail sits atop insulators to keep it isolated from the ground. Trains are equipped
    with shoes that slide along the third rail to collect traction power. It’s a simple
    and effective system, but it does create a shock hazard for people or animals
    near the railway. Strict control of the right of way is required for safety, including

    lines are safer, and thus, most high-voltage systems are installed above the tracks.
    In this setup, a current collector sits atop the train. A few different devices
    can perform this task, but most modern trains employ a pantograph. They use spring-loaded
    arms to maintain contact between a replaceable graphite shoe and the overhead
    conductor. It’s a simple concept but complex in practice. Take a look at standard
    overhead electric or utility lines, and you’ll notice the challenge right away.
    They sag in the middle of the span. Maintaining contact with such large deviations
    in height between each support at high speeds would be impossible, so overhead
    railway power systems use a pair of lines to ensure reliable transfer of electricity
    to the train. The top wire, called the messenger wire, is only for support. The
    curved shape it takes between poles is called a *catenary*, so that name is often
    used to describe the whole system. From the messenger wire, vertical supports
    called drops connect the contact wire below, and that is the line on which the
    pantograph rides.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    along the tracks, making it possible for a pantograph to slide along it at rapid
    speeds. Both wires are energized to carry the traction current, and they are often
    kept under tension with weights suspended on pulleys on either side of the lines.
    This tension takes up slack to reduce the sag of the lines as they expand and
    contract from temperature changes. The tension also increases the speed of waves
    that travel along the wires. It makes the vibrations smaller and higher-frequency
    (just like a guitar string) to minimize bouncing, which can create electric arcs
    each time the contact wire and pantograph separate. The contact wire is held in
    a horizontal zig-zag pattern with registration arms so that the pantograph’s shoe
    wears evenly across its width.

    in the steel running rails on which the wheels roll. With a good connection to

    danger to people and animals. However, return currents create several engineering
    challenges. For one, the rails are where signal circuits typically travel. If
    the rails are carrying return current, the small track circuit signals get overwhelmed.
    Electrified railways often use AC track circuits to control the signals. Relays
    used to detect trains can be designed with filters to pick up specific frequencies

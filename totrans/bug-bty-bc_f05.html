			<p class="ChapterIntro">I still remember the first time I found a high-impact vulnerability. I had already located a few low-impact bugs in the application I was testing, including a CSRF, an IDOR, and a few information leaks. Eventually, I managed to chain these into a full takeover of any account on the website: I could have logged in as anyone, read anyone’s data, and altered it however I wanted. For an instant, I felt like I had superpowers.</p>
			<p>I reported the issue to the company, which promptly fixed the vulnerability. Hackers are probably the closest thing to superheroes I’ve encountered in the real world. They overcome limitations with their skills to make software programs do much more than they were designed for, which is what I love about hacking web applications: it’s all about thinking creatively, challenging yourself, and doing more than what seems possible.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxii" title="xxii"/>Also like superheroes, ethical hackers help keep society safe. Thousands of data breaches happen every year in the United States alone. By understanding vulnerabilities and how they happen, you can use your knowledge for good to help prevent malicious attacks, protect applications and users, and make the internet a safer place.</p>
			<p>
				Not too long ago, hacking and experimenting with web applications were illegal. But now, thanks to bug bounty programs, you can hack legally; companies set up bug bounty programs to reward security researchers for finding vulnerabilities in their applications. <em>Bug Bounty Bootcamp</em> teaches you how to hack web applications and how to do it legally by participating in these programs. You’ll learn how to navigate bug bounty programs, perform reconnaissance on a target, and identify and exploit vulnerabilities.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-501546f05-0001">Who This Book Is For</h2>
			<p>This book will help anyone learn web hacking and bug bounty hunting from scratch. You might be a student looking to get into web security, a web developer who wants to understand the security of a website, or an experienced hacker who wants to understand how to attack web applications. If you are curious about web hacking and web security, this book is for you.</p>
			<p>No technical background is needed to understand and master the material of this book. However, you will find it useful to understand basic programming.</p>
			<p>Although this book was written with beginners in mind, advanced hackers may also find it to be a useful reference. In particular, I discuss advanced exploitation techniques and useful tips and tricks I’ve learned along the way.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-501546f05-0002">What Is In This Book</h2>

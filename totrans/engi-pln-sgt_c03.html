<h2 id="h1-502321c03-0001">Introduction</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Of all the elements of our constructed environment, roads may be the least noticed, yet they are almost as fundamental as the air we breathe. You almost certainly arrived where you are now via a road, and one will likely take you wherever you go next. The first roadways in history were formed as people or animals followed the same trail long enough to erode a path between two points. They have always existed in some form, but they haven’t always been safe, comfortable, or able to accommodate the enormous number and weight of vehicles that use our present system of roadways every day. Over the years, the demands on streets and highways have only increased as more people and goods are on the move. Their designs have evolved alongside this demand. It may not always seem so, but roads now carry more and heavier vehicles than they ever have in history. With their omnipresence, their value to society is easy to forget. But the engineers, contractors, and public works crews who study, design, construct, and maintain our roadways know how important they are in moving goods and transporting people. Whether or not you love how much roads dominate the landscape, you have to marvel at the fact that, in most parts of the modern world, anyone can take a bus, car, bike, truck, motorcycle, or scooter to go almost anywhere else with relative ease and comfort.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c03-0002"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_63" title="63"/>Urban Arterial and Collector Roads</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Nothing has had a more significant impact on the planning and design of cities in the past 100 years than the automobile. With their explosion in popularity in the early 20th century, motor vehicles became the standard mode of urban transportation. And with that, cities needed roads to accommodate the growing volume of traffic. There are a lot of good analogies between cities and human anatomy, and roadways are no exception. In fact, roads are often referred to by their cardiovascular equivalents. <span class="SmallCaps">Highways</span> are like the aorta with a high capacity and single major destination. Small <span class="SmallCaps">collector</span> roads are like capillaries with not much capacity but a connection to every individual house and business. In between are the aptly named <span class="SmallCaps">arterial</span> roadways, the medium-capacity connections between urban centers. All together, they form an urban transportation network allowing vehicles to travel (somewhat) efficiently between any two places on the map.</p>
<p>Although it might not always seem to be the case, streets in cities create routes for more than just automobiles. Collectors and arterial roadways truly make up the city’s circulatory system, providing a path for cars, trucks, buses, bicycles, pedestrians, utility lines, and even stormwater runoff. Although every street is different, most urban roadways share many of the same features. This section provides an overview of the most common elements you might see in your city. </p>
<p>One way to characterize roadways is how they cross, also known as <em>intersections</em>. Collectors and arterial roads commonly overlap <em>at grade</em>, in other words, on the ground at the same level. That means only a few traffic streams can pass through simultaneously, resulting in an interrupted flow of traffic. These intersections are also where a vast majority of crashes occur. For those reasons, traffic engineers put much thought and analysis into the design of intersections and how to make them as safe and efficient as possible. This challenge almost always requires a compromise of numerous conflicting considerations, including space, cost, types and volumes of traffic, and human factors like habits, expectations, and reaction times. The simplest intersections are <span class="SmallCaps">sign-controlled</span>, using stop or yield signs to manage the flow of traffic. They are cost-effective and don’t require any extra space, but they can’t handle high volumes because they create an interruption for every vehicle passing through. <span class="SmallCaps">Signal-controlled intersections</span> use electric lights to indicate which traffic can proceed. (Traffic signals are covered in detail later in the book.) <span class="SmallCaps">Roundabouts</span> are circular intersections that keep traffic flowing around a central island. Although they sometimes take up more space than other types of junctions, they have some distinct advantages. Roundabouts handle traffic efficiently by avoiding the start and stop of interrupted flow, and they create fewer dangerous collisions <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_64" title="64"/>because of the slower speeds and single direction of traffic. Of course, within these three basic categories exist an endless array of intersection configurations. If you drive long enough, you will see the wide variety of intersection types and layouts used by engineers to keep roadway traffic flowing safely and efficiently.</p>
<p>Roadways consist of <span class="SmallCaps">travel lanes</span> for vehicles and occasionally space for <span class="SmallCaps">bicycle</span> and <span class="SmallCaps">parking lanes</span> as well. The roadway’s surface is usually crowned in the center with a slope toward the outer edges to shed rainwater off the driving surface. At the outer edges, <span class="SmallCaps">curbs</span> separate the <span class="SmallCaps">pavement</span> from the developed area, and <span class="SmallCaps">gutters</span> provide a channel for rainwater to travel. Many cities and towns include a narrow strip between the road and <span class="SmallCaps">sidewalk</span> to provide a safety buffer between fast-moving vehicles and vulnerable pedestrians. This area has many regional names, including <span class="SmallCaps">curb strip</span>, <em>verge</em>, and <em>berm</em>. It also provides a location for utility poles, signs, and <span class="SmallCaps">streetlamps</span>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, pavement is not invincible. One of the most common frustrations of city driving is the <span class="SmallCaps">pothole</span>. They’re annoying, yes, but they’re more than that. Potholes cause billions of dollars of damage to tires, shocks, and wheels of vehicles. Even worse, they’re dangerous. Cars swerve to miss them, sometimes at high speeds, and if a bike, motorcycle, or scooter hits one, it can be bad news for the rider. The formation of a pothole happens in steps, the first of which is deterioration of the surface pavement. They might seem innocuous, but <span class="SmallCaps">cracks</span> are critical flaws in a pavement system because they let in water. Soil below the pavement can become waterlogged from precipitation, softening and weakening the <span class="SmallCaps">subgrade</span>. Water below the roadway can also freeze and grow into a formation called an <span class="SmallCaps">ice lens</span>. Water expands when it freezes, and it does so with tremendous force, separating the subgrade and pavement. When those lenses thaw out, the ice that was supporting the pavement recedes, creating voids. Every time a tire hits this soft area, it pushes some of the water and underlying soil back out of the pavement. It’s a slow process at first, but every little bit of subgrade eroded from beneath the pavement means less support, and less support means more volume below the pavement for water to be pumped in and out by traffic. Eventually, the pavement loses enough support that it fails, breaking off and creating a pothole.</p>
<p>Because potholes are so destructive and inconvenient, roadway owners spend a lot of time and money both trying to prevent them from forming and fixing them when they appear. Prevention mainly involves sealing cracks against water intrusion. Repairs can be wide-ranging depending on the materials, cost, and climate conditions. But they all mostly do the same thing: replace the soil and pavement that was lost and (hopefully) seal the area off from further water intrusion. If the <span class="SmallCaps">pothole repair</span> does not create a good connection with the rest of the roadway, a pothole can recur in the same location.</p>

<figure class="graphic"><img alt="" class="" src="image_fi/502321c03/g03003.png"/></figure>
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">The layout of urban streets varies across the world and even across individual cities. Many cities are arranged in a rational grid pattern. The gridiron is as old as human history, and many of the earliest planned cities organized their streets at regular intervals and at right angles to each other. This pattern makes it easy to find your way and gives you many choices in selecting a route. However, it has some disadvantages. For one, it creates numerous intersections where crashes are most likely to occur. Also, grids make every street a <em>through</em> street, which often means more noise and drivers who may be less careful about their surroundings.</p>
<p>Many newer neighborhoods were designed to be disconnected from the main transportation networks to discourage through traffic. The streets are arranged in curvy loops, with T intersections, and <em>cul-de-sacs</em> to slow down traffic and reduce the number of crashes. Connections to main roads happen in only a few locations, which means the cars on the streets consist mainly of neighborhood residents who are more likely to drive carefully. This style of street layout is not without its disadvantages, though. The disconnected, circuitous routes sometimes make it difficult to use any transportation mode other than a motor vehicle. In many places around the world, modern neighborhood planning includes a focus on better connectivity for pedestrians, cyclists, and mass transit users.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c03-0003"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_67" title="67"/>Pedestrian and Bicycle Infrastructure</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Much of our present system of roadways was designed according to a single measure of performance: the safe and efficient movement of motor vehicle traffic. There was a time when cars were not so central to our urban lives. However, for the past 100 years or so, they seem to have been the principal consideration in every part of the planning and design of cities. Unfortunately, this car-centric approach deprives all the other users of urban roadways, including pedestrians and cyclists. In many places, if you try getting around town in anything other than a personal automobile, you’ll face a string of inconveniences and dangers along the way. Luckily, cities are realizing the importance of walkability and bikeability, and how those translate into liveability. These days we aspire to have <em>complete streets</em>—those that balance safety and convenience for everyone using the road. </p>
<p>One of the most apparent pedestrian accommodations is the <span class="SmallCaps">sidewalk</span>, a narrow path generally separated from the street. These footpaths can be made from many materials, but they are ribbons of concrete in most cities. Sidewalks may appear simple, but considerable engineering is present in their design and construction. The cracking of concrete is inevitable. Tree roots invade the subsurface, cycles of freeze and thaw lift the soil, and vehicles impose unanticipated loads. Sidewalks are designed with <span class="SmallCaps">control joints</span> to constrain the cracks’ location to a regular pattern by artificially weakening the concrete. These <span class="SmallCaps">induced cracks</span> are preferential to the unsightly random arrangement that would otherwise occur. Also, concrete shrinks and expands according to temperature. On small structures, this may be imperceptible, but for long shapes (like sidewalks), the thermal movement can add up. Occasional spaces, called <span class="SmallCaps">expansion joints</span>, are left in the concrete to prevent sidewalks from buckling or having significant gaps. The joints are typically filled with wood, cork, or <span class="SmallCaps">rubber</span> to allow for movement over time.</p>
<p><em>Accessibility</em> is the term used to describe how we make sidewalks and other pedestrian facilities safe and efficient for all users, including those with disabilities. Sidewalks have specific minimum widths and slopes to make sure they’re not too challenging to traverse. Where a sidewalk meets a curb, it often includes a ramp down to the street’s surface. This ramp is called a <span class="SmallCaps">curb cut</span>, and it ensures that users of wheelchairs, walkers, and canes can easily transition onto the path. It also helps pedestrians pushing carts or strollers and even children on bicycles. In addition, sidewalks often feature <span class="SmallCaps">tactile pavement</span>. These bumpy areas help people with visual disabilities delineate the boundary between sidewalk and road. They are detectable warnings for those who might not otherwise be able to identify a potential hazard, including subway lines, steep grades, stairs, and road crossings. They often have a contrasting color so <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_68" title="68"/>they’re easy to recognize, and many use a familiar texture called <span class="SmallCaps">truncated domes</span>.</p>
<p>Another critical aspect of pedestrian infrastructure is to allow those on foot to cross streets safely. <span class="SmallCaps">Crosswalks</span> are designated areas for pedestrians to cross a road, making them more visible and predictable to motorists. They are usually located at intersections and marked with large white bars. When a junction has a traffic signal, <span class="SmallCaps">lights</span> at either end of each crosswalk show pedestrians when to cross. Some pedestrian signals even include a <span class="SmallCaps">countdown timer</span> to show how many seconds are remaining to cross. Depending on the traffic volume, the crossing signal may be simultaneous with the green light for vehicle traffic, or there may be a phase when only pedestrians are allowed to move. Some lights stagger the phases, so pedestrians get a head start from drivers. Some signals operate exclusively on a preprogrammed timer, while others are actuated with a <span class="SmallCaps">call button</span> at the sidewalk. Even if the switch is present, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s connected to the signal controller. Sometimes these buttons are simply <em>placebos</em>, or work only during certain times of the day.</p>
<p>Bicycling is one of the most efficient, healthy, and fun ways to get around, but biking in a city without dedicated cycling infrastructure often feels life-threatening. Most places have laws allowing bikes to use the same travel lanes as motor vehicles, but few cyclists feel comfortable doing so except on the least busy streets. There are many different approaches to accommodating bicycle traffic in cities. One of the most straightforward measures is the <span class="SmallCaps">sharrow</span>, a symbol used to mark the preferred path for cyclists on shared travel lanes. <em>Uniformity</em> is a crucial concept in traffic engineering. If all road users know what to expect, they are less likely to make errors in judgment that lead to collisions. Sharrows don’t explicitly provide protection or separation for cyclists, but they help establish expectations between motorists and bicyclists to avoid confusion (and hopefully tension) on the road.</p>
<p>The next step up in bicycling infrastructure is the <span class="SmallCaps">painted bike lane</span>. These dedicated paths don’t provide physical division from vehicles. Still, they visually separate the primary travel lanes, creating a perceptual division between the two streams of traffic (which often have very different prevailing speeds). Bike lines sometimes feature green paint in the United States to further distinguish them from the rest of the road, and they occasionally include painted <span class="SmallCaps">buffers</span> to create more space between vehicles and cyclists.</p> <p>Separated bike lanes provide the highest level of safety and comfort for those of all abilities. These are exclusive cycling paths with a physical <span class="SmallCaps">barrier</span> of some kind from the main roadway. Of course, separate and dedicated tracks require significant investment, so they are often reserved for only the most highly trafficked routes. </p>
<p>One way to make pedestrians and cyclists safer is to reduce motor vehicles’ speed and volume. Changing the posted speed limit is usually not enough to slow <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_69" title="69"/>down cars, so engineers and city planners employ more creative methods of <span class="SmallCaps">traffic calming</span>. At intersections, reducing the <span class="SmallCaps">curb</span> <span class="SmallCaps">radius</span> can slow down vehicles making turns and shorten the crossing distance for pedestrians. However, doing so is feasible only in areas without much truck traffic (since they need more room to turn). Calming options away from intersections include <span class="SmallCaps">neckdowns</span> to constrict the roadway width, <span class="SmallCaps">chicanes</span> to add gentle turns, <span class="SmallCaps">trees</span> to reduce the sight distance, and <span class="SmallCaps">speed humps</span> to provide a physical impediment to fast-moving vehicles.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Ever wonder about the difference between speed humps, bumps, and lumps? A <em>speed hump</em> is a tool to slow down vehicles on public roadways and is usually 4 meters (12 feet) in width. A <em>speed bump</em> is smaller in width but taller in height, and is intended for parking lots and garages. <em>Speed lumps</em> (also called cushions) are similar to speed humps, but they have gaps to allow emergency vehicles to pass through without slowing down. These obstacles are unappreciated by motorists, mainly because they are uncomfortable even at the slowest of speeds. Newer designs in development use fluids that harden when drivers go too fast but let slow drivers through without a bump.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c03-0004"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_71" title="71"/>Traffic Signals</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Traffic management in dense urban areas is a complex problem with a host of conflicting goals and challenges. One of the most fundamental of those challenges happens at an intersection where multiple traffic streams—including motor vehicles, bikes, and pedestrians—need to cross one another’s paths safely and efficiently. One of the most common ways we control the <em>right of way</em> at intersections is the traffic signal. Using signals isn’t a panacea for all traffic problems, but they offer a balance of many essential considerations, namely their minimal space requirements and ability to handle large volumes of traffic with only minor interruptions.</p>
<p>Intersections need to be rigidly standardized so that when you come to an unfamiliar one, you already know your role in the careful and chaotic dance of vehicles and pedestrians. That’s why almost all traffic signals in a specific area or country look similar. In their simplest form, traffic signals are a set of three <span class="SmallCaps">lights</span> facing each lane of an intersection. The lights hang from suspended cables or rigid <span class="SmallCaps">support structures</span>. In general, when the light is green, the vehicles in that lane are permitted to cross. When the light is red, they aren’t. The amber light warns that the signal is about to change from green to red. Beyond this primary function, traffic signals can take on innumerable complexities to accommodate all kinds of situations.</p>
<p>At each approach to the intersection, vehicles can go in one of three directions, which are called <em>movements</em>: <span class="SmallCaps">right</span>, <span class="SmallCaps">through</span>, or <span class="SmallCaps">left</span>. Right and through are usually grouped as a single movement, so a typical four-way intersection has two vehicle and one <span class="SmallCaps">pedestrian movement</span> for each direction. These movements can be grouped into phases of the traffic signal. For example, the left-turn movements on opposite approaches can be grouped into a single phase because they can go simultaneously without conflicts. Traffic engineers determine the grouping of movements into phases and the order of each phase through a signal cycle to accommodate different volumes and types of traffic.</p>
<p>Another critical decision is how long each sequence of a phase should last. Ideally, a green light should last at least long enough to clear the <span class="SmallCaps">queue</span> built up during the red light, but it isn’t always possible, especially during peak times on busy intersections. In cases where the junction is <span class="SmallCaps">saturated</span>, the green light might be extended to reduce the number of cycles since each one includes <span class="SmallCaps">startup</span> and <span class="SmallCaps">clearance</span> times—the periods when the intersection isn’t being utilized to its maximum capacity.</p>
<p>The amber light needs to last long enough for drivers to perceive the warning and decelerate their vehicles to a stop at a comfortable rate. Design guidelines consider many factors, but the duration of the amber light is usually set to around one second for every 10 miles per hour or 16 kilometers per hour on the speed limit. In most places in North America, you are allowed to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_72" title="72"/>enter an intersection for the entire duration of a yellow light, which means there needs to be a time when all phases have a red light to allow the junction to clear. This clearance interval is usually about one second, but it can be adjusted up or down based on the speed limit and intersection size.</p>
<p>Some traffic signals use a set timing sequence programmed into the controller, but many are more sophisticated than that. <em>Actuated signal control</em> is the term we use for traffic lights that can receive input from the outside to adjust timing and phase sequence on the fly. Actuated signals rely on data from traffic-detection systems that can be <span class="SmallCaps">video cameras</span>, <span class="SmallCaps">radar detectors</span>, or <span class="SmallCaps">inductive loop sensors</span> embedded into the road surface. These latter sensors are essentially large metal detectors that can measure whether a car or truck is present (to the annoyance of bicycles, scooters, and motorcycles that are sometimes too small to trigger the loop). Whatever the type of sensor, they all feed data into an <span class="SmallCaps">equipment cabinet</span> located nearby. You’ve probably seen hundreds of these cabinets without realizing their purpose.</p>
<p>Inside this cabinet is a <span class="SmallCaps">traffic signal controller</span>, a simple computer programmed with logic to determine when and how long each phase will last based on the information from the detectors. Actuated control gives a traffic signal much more flexibility to handle variations in traffic load. For example, if a nearby road is closed and traffic is rerouted through an intersection that doesn’t usually see such high demand, it may need to be reprogrammed before the closure. A traffic signal equipped with actuated control will simply see the additional traffic and adjust its phasing accordingly. The same is true with special events, like concerts and sports games, that create colossal traffic demands on irregular schedules. Actuated systems can also keep you from waiting at a long light when no one’s crossing in the other direction. Finally, actuated control can help prioritize emergency and public transportation vehicles equipped with specialized transmitters. Infrared or acoustic <span class="SmallCaps">preemption devices</span> communicate with transmitters on each prioritized vehicle to send the signal controller a call for green.</p>
<p>Actuated control isn’t the pinnacle of signal complexity. After all, it still treats each intersection as an isolated entity when it is actually one component of a larger traffic network. Each element of the traffic network can have an impact on other parts of the system. The classic example of this is <em>gridlock</em>, where queues of vehicles block adjacent intersections in a way that brings the flow of traffic to a standstill. One solution to this problem is <em>signal coordination</em>, where lights can work in synchronization with each other. Coordinated signals are employed on long corridors with small but frequent cross streets. The signals on the major road are timed so that a large group of vehicles, called a <em>platoon</em> by traffic engineers, can make it some or all of the way through the corridor without interruption. This coordination can significantly increase the volume of traffic able to pass through intersections, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_73" title="73"/>but it works only on stretches of road that don’t have other sources of traffic interruptions like driveways and businesses. If the platoon can’t stick together, the benefits of coordinating signals are reduced.</p>
<p>The obvious next step in efficiency is coordinating most or all of the signals within a traffic network. This is the job of <em>adaptive signal control technologies</em>. In adaptive systems, rather than individual groups of lights, all the information from detectors is fed into a centralized system (often wirelessly with <span class="SmallCaps">antennas</span> at each signal) that can use advanced algorithms to optimize traffic flow throughout the city. These systems can dramatically reduce congestion, and many cities have implemented adaptive technologies for their traffic signals. </p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">A <em>pedestrian scramble</em> is a traffic signal phase that stops all vehicular traffic, allowing pedestrians to cross an intersection in every direction, including diagonally. These scrambles are feasible only at junctions with high volumes of pedestrian traffic since it takes longer to walk across the diagonal, extending the wait time for motorists. They are most common in downtown areas where turning vehicles would have to wait for large numbers of crossing pedestrians if the vehicle and pedestrian movements were simultaneous.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c03-0005"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_75" title="75"/>Traffic Signs and Markings</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">One of the most important aspects of making roadways safe and efficient is the uniformity of signs and markings. Motorists moving at rapid speeds must make snap decisions. When signs are instantly recognizable and understandable, drivers and other roadway users experience less confusion and fewer surprises. That means they are less likely to misjudge a hazard or make a poor decision. The signs and markings used to regulate, warn, or guide traffic on roadways are collectively known as <em>traffic control devices</em>. Just about every aspect of their design is rigidly standardized within an individual country (and sometimes internationally). Sizes, shapes, locations, colors, symbols, and words are all carefully prescribed to ensure that drivers will be comfortable and capable of navigating the roadways no matter where they happen to go. It also makes our infrastructure more cost-effective because materials, products, and equipment are standardized across the country. In the United States, the manual that governs the uniformity of traffic control devices is more than 800 pages long. It includes guidelines for just about any situation that could be encountered in roadway design.</p>
<p><em>Traffic signs</em> need to convey information as clearly and directly as possible because road users have only a moment to recognize, comprehend, and respond to them. Signs are intended to provide their message first by shape, then by color, and finally by meaning or symbol. The most important signs can be recognized simply by shape (for example, an octagonal stop sign). </p>
<p>Three major categories of signs (along with many minor types) are used on roadways: regulatory, warning, and guide signs.<span class="SmallCaps"> Regulatory signs</span> inform road users of traffic laws and include speed limit, stop, and yield signs. They mostly use a combination of black, white, and red colors. <span class="SmallCaps">Warning signs</span> alert road users to hazards or unexpected conditions. They are almost always yellow diamonds with black writing. <span class="SmallCaps">Object markers</span> are another type of warning sign to mark obstructions in the roadway or alongside it using diagonal yellow and black stripes. <span class="SmallCaps">Guide signs</span> inform road users of helpful information for navigation and direct them along their way, and they’re almost always green with a white border and message. <span class="SmallCaps">Route markers</span> are another type of guide sign. They use distinctive shapes (often shields) and colors to differentiate road classifications.</p>
<p>Most signs are mounted on metal<span class="SmallCaps"> posts</span> adjacent to the roadway. These posts hold the sign high enough to be easily seen by all road users. The other option for sign mounting is overhead structures, which are most common on highways because traffic can obstruct the view of post-mounted signs from the centermost lanes. Overhead sign mounts allow better visibility for all traffic lanes, and they come in two varieties. When carried by only a single vertical member, they are called <span class="SmallCaps">cantilever sign supports</span>. These can extend only so far because <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_76" title="76"/>the load is unbalanced. For wider roadways, the supports are held on both sides by a structure called a <span class="SmallCaps">sign bridge</span>.</p>
<p>Although signs are critical to keeping roadways safe and efficient, they can represent a hazard. Signs’ narrow poles can pass through many parts of a car or truck like butter. If an errant vehicle hits a signpost or vertical support, it can significantly worsen the damage and danger of the crash, so signposts are required to be <em>crashworthy</em>. In most cases, posts have a <em>breakaway</em> feature to reduce the impact on a vehicle if struck, minimizing potential for injury to the occupants. Wooden posts have holes drilled in them, so they easily break when hit. Metal signposts often use breakaway hardware called <span class="SmallCaps">slip bases</span>. These joints connect using plates with bolts in open slots. When hit, the bolts easily slip out, allowing the signpost to give way. A slip base has the added benefit of streamlining the replacement of a sign that has been knocked over. The concrete and base remain intact, so installing a new sign atop the original base is as simple as bolting it on. Overhead signs can’t be designed to break away because a falling sign could endanger other roadway users. Instead, the supports are protected from collisions using a <span class="SmallCaps">guardrail</span>, barrier, or crash cushion. (More information about these structures is provided in a later section.)</p>
<p>Another type of traffic control device involves placing markings on the road surface itself. <span class="SmallCaps">Lines</span> and <span class="SmallCaps">stripes</span> are painted onto the pavement to provide information and guidance to road users. Depending on the traffic levels and budget, different materials are used for these markings, from simple latex paint to <em>thermoplastics</em> that are melted onto the road surface. In areas that receive snow, lines are often recessed into the pavement to protect them against snowplows.</p>
<p><span class="SmallCaps">Raised pavement markers</span> are another surface feature used to guide motorists. They provide both visual and tactile feedback since driving over them makes a noticeable bump. The colors of the reflectors in raised pavement markers carry different meanings. White and yellow are used for marking lanes. Blue markers show the locations of fire hydrants. If you ever see red reflectors, turn around! They are often installed on the backside of pavement markers to warn wrong-way drivers. <span class="SmallCaps">Rumble strips</span> are a type of surface safety device not to be seen but heard. They are created by grinding grooves into the pavement at regular intervals. When a car wanders outside its lane, the sound and vibration from the rumble strip will warn the driver of the deviation.</p>
<p>Traffic control devices aren’t much use if they aren’t visible in the dark. It used to be common to have dedicated lights to illuminate road signs at night or during poor weather. Now, almost all signs and roadway markings are <em>retroreflective</em>, meaning they reflect light back toward its source in the same direction as it came. <span class="SmallCaps">Retroreflective surfaces</span> take advantage of headlights, bouncing their light directly back toward the vehicle and driver inside. This makes signs and road markings appear much brighter than their non-retroreflective <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_77" title="77"/>surroundings. Signs are surfaced with plastic sheeting embedded with <span class="SmallCaps">glass beads</span> or <span class="SmallCaps">prismatic elements</span>. Retroreflective glass beads are also embedded into the markings on roadway surfaces, making them more visible to vehicles with their headlights on. These beads are sometimes known as <em>cat’s eyes</em> because they function similarly to the way a cat’s eyes appear to glow at night when subjected to light.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Sometimes a message or warning is so important that it is placed right on the road surface where drivers are sure to see it. However, unlike signs that face directly toward a driver’s eyeline, the road’s surface can only be seen from a vehicle at a shallow angle. The resulting markings appear foreshortened and challenging to read. And the foreshortening gets even worse when motorists are moving at a rapid speed. As an example, most people significantly underestimate the length of stripes on a roadway. They appear much shorter than the standard 3 meters (10 feet). Letters and symbols on the road surface are elongated to combat this optical illusion and improve the legibility to drivers. In most cases, markings on the roadway surface are stretched two to five times their standard size along the direction of travel. Hold the book at just the right angle to your eyes, and the words in the illustration will look perfectly normal.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c03-0006"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_79" title="79"/>Highway Earthwork and Retaining Walls</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The natural landscape is never perfectly suited to roadway construction as it stands. The Earth is just too uneven to traverse at rapid speeds easily. Safe and efficient travel requires gentle curves, both horizontally and vertically. It needs grades that aren’t too steep and paths that are relatively direct between points of interest. That means to build a road, we need a way to smooth out the surface of the Earth. All the ways we use to modify the ground’s shape and structure are collectively known as <em>earthwork</em>, and they can be the most crucial aspect of a roadway construction project.</p>
<p>Engineers and contractors use <em>cross sections</em> to communicate the shape of roadways. These drawings show slices through the road along its length, and they are the literal language of road building. On a cross section, you can see the earth’s level before construction (called the <span class="SmallCaps">natural grade</span>) and the proposed surface after completion. Any difference in those two lines means some earthwork will be required. Areas above the proposed roadway need to be excavated away, also known as areas of <span class="SmallCaps">cut</span>. Excavation is necessary when the final level will be lower than the surrounding terrain, such as through a steep hillside. Areas below the proposed road need to be raised with <span class="SmallCaps">fill</span>, such as when passing over a stream or on the approaches to a bridge. Larger areas of fill are often called <span class="SmallCaps">embankments</span>. Cuts and fills are the most fundamental elements of any earthwork project. Of course, you can’t visually compare before and after the earthwork is accomplished side by side, but it is often apparent where the natural landscape has been modified once you start paying attention.</p>
<p>You might notice that cuts and fills usually tie into the natural grade on a slope. That’s because a soil’s strength almost entirely depends on internal friction between the individual soil particles. Pour out some sand on a table, and you’ll notice that the pile doesn’t stand straight up. Instead, it forms a slope. This slope’s angle is called the <em>angle of repose</em>, which is the steepest angle at which a soil can naturally rest. Add some weight to the top of your pile, and it will collapse even further.</p>
<p>A slope’s stability can vary significantly depending on the type of soil and the loading it needs to withstand, but engineers rarely trust anything steeper than around 25 degrees. That means a constructed slope must be at least twice as wide as it is tall, which can be a problem for two reasons. First, it takes about twice as much material as a slope that can stand vertically, requiring a lot more excavation or fill to construct. Second, it takes up more space, which can be at a premium, especially in crowded cities. In many situations, it makes sense to avoid these disadvantages by using a <span class="SmallCaps">retaining wall</span> to support a steep (and even vertical) slope.</p>
<p>Soil doesn’t flow as easily as water, but it is around twice as heavy. Thus, the force exerted on a retaining wall, called the <em><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_80" title="80"/>lateral earth pressure</em>, can be enormous<span class="SmallCaps">.</span> Accordingly, retaining walls must be quite strong to withstand this pressure. Many different types of retaining walls solve this problem in various ways. You’ll notice a variety of these walls in the constructed environment if you know where to look. They aren’t only for roadway projects, but that’s a common application. The most basic retaining walls rely on gravity for their stability, often employing a <span class="SmallCaps">footing</span> to create a <span class="SmallCaps">cantilever wall</span>. In this configuration, the wall can use the weight of the restrained soil to its advantage. The earth sits atop the footing, which acts as a lever, helping keep the wall upright against the lateral forces.</p>
<p>Some retaining walls use <span class="SmallCaps">ground anchors</span> (also called <em>tiebacks</em>) to provide horizontal stability. The anchors consist of steel strands or bars grouted into the soil behind the wall. Once installed, a hydraulic jack applies tension to each anchor, and tapered wedges or <span class="SmallCaps">nuts</span> lock the anchors firmly against the wall. <span class="SmallCaps">Bearing blocks</span> or plates are often used to distribute the anchor load across a larger area, recognizable from the outside from their repeating pattern.</p>
<p>Another kind of retaining wall uses <em>piles</em>, vertical members driven or drilled into the ground. They include reinforced <span class="SmallCaps">concrete shafts</span> installed with a drilling rig like gigantic fence posts. They also include interlocking steel shapes called <span class="SmallCaps">sheet piling</span>. Pile walls are often used for temporary excavations during construction projects because the wall can be installed first before digging begins, ensuring that the excavated faces have support for the entirety of construction.</p>
<p>One common type of retaining wall involves tying a mass of soil together to act as its own wall. This can be accomplished during the fill operation by layering reinforcement elements between each lift, a technique called <span class="SmallCaps">mechanically stabilized earth</span>. The <span class="SmallCaps">reinforcing elements</span> can be steel strips or fabric made from plastic fibers called <em>geotextile</em> or <em>geogrid</em>. When the natural ground is excavated to create a steep face, adding layers of reinforcement isn’t feasible. Instead, <span class="SmallCaps">soil nails</span> can be inserted into the slope as reinforcement. Like ground anchors, soil nails consist of steel rods grouted into drilled holes. But unlike anchors, they are not tensioned. Instead of applying a force to the wall’s face, their job is to secure the soil mass together to support itself and the soil behind it.</p>
<p>Both mechanically stabilized earth and soil nail retaining walls use concrete on the outside face of the wall. These facings are rarely supporting much of the load. Instead, their job is to protect the exposed soil from erosion, and in permanent applications, improve the wall’s appearance. In temporary situations, the facing sometimes consists of <span class="SmallCaps">shotcrete</span>, a type of concrete that can be sprayed from a hose using compressed air. For permanent installations, they often use interlocking concrete<span class="SmallCaps"> panels</span> with a decorative pattern. These panels not only look nice, but they also allow for some movement over time and for water to drain through the joints.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Sometimes a road cut is made where the underlying ground is mostly rock rather than soil. It is much more difficult to excavate through rock than soil, but a retaining wall usually isn’t required to support the exposed faces (since rock can often be trusted—after a detailed engineering analysis—to hold itself up). That means many road cuts are left entirely uncovered, revealing extraordinary snapshots into the surface of the Earth. These road cuts may appear as boring walls of rock at first glance. But to a geologist, their strata are indispensable glimpses into how different landscapes were formed. In fact, roadside geology is a hobby on its own, with guidebooks available for many parts of the world. From chalky limestone to swirling marble, you can gain a whole new appreciation of our rocky planet from the comfort of your vehicle. Be careful, though, because this hobby can be both a figurative and literal slippery slope! You may find yourself planning routes on road trips based on which rocks are visible via the highway, but always be sure to take precautions when stopping near busy roads and when clambering over steep terrain.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c03-0007"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_83" title="83"/>Typical Highway Section</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">I’m often asked why road construction projects seem to take so long when the finished product is just a simple ribbon of pavement sitting on the ground. It’s not because of idle construction workers or dishonest contractors. It’s because highways are complicated. Ensuring roadways can carry the amount and weight of modern cars and trucks and allow them to travel safely at such incredible speeds is no small feat. The only reason it seems ordinary to us is that roadways are so carefully designed and constructed. From the ground up, highways have many features to make fast and efficient vehicle travel possible.</p>
<p>You only see the outer surface when driving, but there is much more to a roadway structure below the surface. Roads are built in layers, sometimes called <em>courses</em>, to make them durable and long-lasting. Before any new roadway can be installed, some earthwork is required to smooth the surface of the earth (as described in the previous section). The layer of existing soil upon which a road is constructed is called the <span class="SmallCaps">subgrade</span>, and it’s not always well-suited to withstand the tremendous and frequent loads from vehicular traffic. Instead, one or more courses of <span class="SmallCaps">road base</span> are placed and compacted on top of the subgrade, often made from crushed rock. Road base serves a variety of purposes. It provides a stable platform during construction, distributes the weight of vehicles evenly to the subgrade, provides drainage for any water that infiltrates below the road, and protects the pavement from frost.</p>
<p>The top layer of pavement is the <span class="SmallCaps">wearing course</span> because it’s the one exposed to the controlled chaos of constant motor vehicle traffic. Concrete is occasionally used as the wearing course for major highways because it is exceptionally hard and durable. Concrete consists of cement, rocks (known as <span class="SmallCaps">aggregate</span> in the industry), and water, and it can withstand huge volumes of heavy truck traffic better than any other pavement. But concrete has some disadvantages, too. It is expensive to install. It’s hard to repair because it takes a long time to cure, extending the duration of road and lane closures. And it can also be too slick when wet, so it must be grooved for traction with tires. That’s why, instead of concrete, most roadways are paved using <span class="SmallCaps">asphalt</span>.</p>
<p>Asphalt pavement has only two primary ingredients: aggregate and <span class="SmallCaps">bitumen</span>, a thick, sticky binder material from the refinement of crude oil. Asphalt just ticks so many of the boxes needed for modern roadways. The materials are readily available. It provides excellent traction with tires without needing grooves. It’s flexible, so it can accommodate some movement of the subgrade without failure. Finally, it’s easy to repair. Asphalt is heated into a workable mix, placed atop the base course, and then compacted into place with heavy <span class="SmallCaps">rollers</span>. It is ready for traffic almost as soon as it cools down.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_84" title="84"/>The term <span class="SmallCaps">highway</span> is usually used to describe the entire width of the paved road. It consists of the <span class="SmallCaps">travel lanes</span> in which vehicles drive and <span class="SmallCaps">shoulders,</span> which serve as emergency stopping lanes for vehicles that break down. Shoulders are usually narrower than travel lanes and occasionally paved to a lesser thickness to save cost, so they can’t accommodate regular travel. Although highways might look flat, they usually slope toward the edges, giving the center of the road a <span class="SmallCaps">crown</span>. A flat surface doesn’t shed water quickly. Any accumulation of water is dangerous to vehicles by making roads slippery and creating more ice in the winter. Crowning the roadway accelerates the drainage of precipitation and keeps the surface of the road dry. Once the water has reached the edge of the pavement, it needs somewhere to go. Otherwise, it can soften and weaken the soils underlying the road. Highways often include <span class="SmallCaps">ditches</span> along the roadside to carry rainwater away. (See <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 7">Chapter 7</span> for more details on drainage structures.)</p>
<p>Some of the most dangerous crashes occur when a vehicle veers off the road due to a hazard or loss of control. Many safety features on highways are designed to prevent roadway departures from turning into serious collisions. Major routes often separate the two traffic directions with a <span class="SmallCaps">median</span>, creating a divided highway. The median between the roadways is a grassed area used to prevent errant vehicles from crossing into the opposing traffic, reducing head-on collisions. Most highways also include a <span class="SmallCaps">clear zone</span> along the outside of each highway, an unobstructed area that gives drivers room to stop or regain control if their vehicle leaves the roadway. The clear zone is kept free of obstacles like trees, signs, and utility poles that could make a crash more serious. When signs must be placed in this area, they have breakaway supports to reduce the impact of a potential collision. And when an obstacle in the clear zone can’t be removed or made crashworthy, it must be protected with a barrier.</p>
<p>Longitudinal barriers keep vehicles from leaving the roadway when a dangerous <span class="SmallCaps">obstacle</span> or drop-off is present. They are also used in place of or in addition to a median between a divided highway. There are many types of barriers used for various situations, and they all go through full-scale crash testing before being used on active roadways. Steel <span class="SmallCaps">guardrails</span> can deflect when hit, which somewhat softens the blow of a collision but also means they must be replaced after each crash. Another common type of longitudinal barrier, called a <span class="SmallCaps">Jersey barrier</span>, is made of concrete. Its shape allows a tire to ride up the side, often redirecting the vehicle without causing significant damage.</p>
<p>One challenge with longitudinal barriers is that their blunt ends can create a dangerous obstacle in the clear zone. Most feature end treatments to lessen the severity of a collision if struck. Steel guardrails often feature an <span class="SmallCaps">impact head</span> that slides along the rail when hit, <span class="SmallCaps">deforming</span> it to absorb the energy of the crash while redirecting it to the side <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_85" title="85"/>to protect the vehicle’s occupants. Rigid barriers often include a <span class="SmallCaps">crash cushion</span> at their ends. There are a wide variety of designs, but the most common feature barrels filled with sand or crushable steel components that can absorb the energy of a collision, significantly reducing the severity.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Unlike concrete, asphalt pavement doesn’t go through a chemical reaction to cure. Instead, we use temperature to transform it from a workable mix to a stable driving surface, a process that is entirely reversible and repeatable. That means asphalt is nearly 100 percent recyclable. In fact, asphalt concrete is one of the world’s most recycled materials by weight. Many of the roads you drive on every day probably came, at least in part, from other nearby streets or highways that reached the end of their life. We even have equipment that can recycle pavement in place, minimizing traffic interruptions and the costs of hauling all that material to and from the job site. A typical paving “train” consists of a milling machine to remove the old asphalt, a recycling unit to warm and mix it with additives, a paver to place the rejuvenated asphalt, and compactors to compress it into place.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c03-0008"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_87" title="87"/>Typical Highway Layout</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">One class of roadway looks much different from urban arterial and collector roads. I use the term <em>highway</em> in this book, but others may call them freeways, motorways, expressways, or throughways. Whatever way you call them, they achieve the pinnacle of traffic capacity through <em>controlled access</em>. For smaller highways, that means a reduced number of driveways and at-grade <span class="SmallCaps">intersections</span>. For the highest capacity roads, it means the only way to enter or exit them is by a ramp or interchange (more on those in a later section). Controlling access to the road reduces interruptions, allowing a relatively unhindered flow of high-speed traffic. That increased speed usually means increased roadway capacity. However, it also decreases the time for decision-making by drivers and, thus, increases the potential for dangerous crashes. It is remarkable that we’re able to put ourselves in metal boxes that hurtle away at incredible speeds from place to place, and highways include a multitude of safety features that make such travel possible. This safety starts at the most basic level possible in how the roadway unfolds as you drive along (often simply called its <em>layout</em>).</p>
<p>In an ideal world, every road would be a straight flat path, and we could race along at whatever speed we wanted. But all highways include hazards like curves, hills, traffic, obstacles, and weather. Reality dictates that we balance vehicles’ speed with drivers’ abilities to navigate such dangers. Three essential speeds on highways are not always equal: the <em>design speed</em>, the posted <em>speed limit</em>, and the speed at which any individual driver chooses to travel. Drivers select their speed based on their personal skill level, comfort, and perception of hazards. Roadway operators set the speed limit based on widely accepted standards for safety. Highway designers choose a design speed to ensure that all the geometric features along the roadway are consistent and appropriate for the eventual velocity at which most drivers will travel.</p>
<p>A highway’s <em>alignment</em> is its horizontal layout—the way it appears when looking from above. All roads include <span class="SmallCaps">curves</span> needed to change the direction of travel, and those curves can present severe challenges to drivers if not designed correctly. Any object changing its direction needs a <span class="SmallCaps">centripetal force</span> toward the center of the turn. Otherwise, it will just continue in a straight line. When you feel pushed to one side of the vehicle during a turn, this is your body’s inertia trying to keep you moving straight while your car turns. For a vehicle, the centripetal force comes from the friction between the tires and the road. This force increases as the <span class="SmallCaps">radius</span> of the turn decreases. At a certain speed and turning radius, the required centripetal force can exceed the tire friction, leading a vehicle to skid off the roadway. To avoid this dangerous condition, engineers select the minimum turning radius of curves depending on the roadway’s design speed—the faster the rate, the gentler the curve.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_88" title="88"/>Rubber tires provide traction against a road surface, but we can also use geometry to make curves safer for drivers. Highway designers often make the outside edge higher or <span class="SmallCaps">superelevated</span> above the centerline to reduce the need for tire friction around curves. Banking a roadway around a turn takes advantage of the <em>normal</em><span class="SmallCaps"> </span>(that is, perpendicular) <em>force</em> from the pavement to provide some or all of the needed centripetal force. In general, the faster the design speed of the road, the steeper the bank around the bend. Superelevation also makes travel around curves more comfortable because the centrifugal tendency pushes passengers into their seats rather than out of them. If the superelevation angle is just right and you’re traveling at precisely the roadway’s design speed, the level in your cup of coffee won’t change at all around the bend.</p>
<p>One other important aspect when designing a horizontal curve comes from the simple but crucial fact that drivers need to see what’s coming up to react accordingly. <span class="SmallCaps">Sight distance</span> is the length of the roadway visible to the driver at any given point in time. On a straight and level section of highway, it is limited only by the driver’s visual acuity. However, any time a roadway changes direction, a driver’s <span class="SmallCaps">field of view</span> can be blocked by <span class="SmallCaps">obstructions</span>. If the sight distance isn’t enough to recognize and respond to a hazard, a crash may result. The faster you’re traveling, the more distance you need to observe turns or obstacles and decide how to manage them. Even if a curve is gentle enough for a car to traverse without skidding, it may not have enough sight distance for safety due to an obstacle like a hill or wooded area obscuring the driver’s view. In such a case, the highway designer would need to increase the curve’s radius to lengthen the driver’s sight distance to a safer extent (or just remove the obstacle).</p>
<p>The final aspect of roadway geometry is the vertical configuration, also known as the <em>profile</em>. Roads rarely traverse perfectly flat areas. Instead, they go up and over hills and down into valleys. The slope, or <em>grade</em>, of a roadway is an important design decision. Roads that are too steep make travel difficult, especially for heavy trucks. Uphill stretches are slow-going, and long downhill sections can overheat vehicles’ brakes. Grade changes also must happen smoothly to avoid bumps and jerks for the comfort of drivers. On top of all that, vertical curves have the potential to reduce drivers’ sight distance.</p>
<p><span class="SmallCaps">Crest curves</span>—the ones that are convex upward—cause the roadway to hide itself beyond the top. If you’re traveling quickly up a hill, a stalled vehicle or animal on the other side could take you by surprise. A crest curve that is too tight won’t give you enough sight distance to recognize and react to the obstacle. So, designers must make sure that these curves are sufficiently gentle so that you can still see enough of the roadway as you go up and over. <span class="SmallCaps">Sag curves</span>—the ones that are concave upward—don’t have this same issue. During the day, you can see all the roadway on both sides of the curve. However, at night things change. Vehicles rely on <span class="SmallCaps">headlights</span> to illuminate the road ahead, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_89" title="89"/>and sometimes this can be the limiting factor for sight distance. If a sag curve is too tight, headlights won’t throw as far. The result is that the sight distance is reduced, making it difficult to react to obstacles at night.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Although they are both called <em>rush hour</em>, the peak periods of traffic during the morning and evening commutes are never identical. In large metropolitan areas, it is typical to have more vehicles traveling toward the city center in the morning and away from it during the evening. This tidal flow of traffic often leads to roadways being underutilized, with heavy congestion in one direction and light traffic in the other. It’s certainly frustrating to be stuck in traffic with so much empty pavement alongside you. Many places take advantage of those unoccupied lanes by making them reversible, so their travel direction depends on the time of day. There are many ways to achieve such bidirectionality, but one of the most effective is the moveable barrier. Certain roads are equipped with hinged concrete dividers that can be shifted between lanes. Twice per day in the lulls between morning and evening, a machine traverses the roadway, “zippering” the barriers to reverse one or more lanes’ direction and increase the capacity during each rush hour.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c03-0009"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_91" title="91"/>Interchanges</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">As discussed in previous sections, when roads intersect, it almost always creates a challenge. Multiple streams of traffic need a way to occupy the overlapping space safely. When the intersection is at grade (in other words, on the ground), traffic flow must be interrupted. Through signs, signals, or roundabouts, the <em>right of way</em> is assigned to each traffic stream individually while the others wait. Those frequent starts and stops aren’t desirable on a highway that uses controlled access to reduce interruptions, allowing a relatively unhindered flow of high-speed traffic. Instead, entrances, exits, and intersections of highways are often accomplished through grade-separated junctions, also known as interchanges. Grade separation allows streams of traffic to cross each other safely and efficiently without interruption.</p>
<p>One of the most common types of grade-separated junction is the <span class="SmallCaps">diamond interchange</span>, used where a controlled-access <span class="SmallCaps">highway</span> crosses a <span class="SmallCaps">minor road</span>. Off-ramps diverge from the highway, meeting the minor road at a right angle. The <span class="SmallCaps">off-ramps</span> become <span class="SmallCaps">on-ramps</span> past the minor road, returning to the highway. The two conventional intersections formed at the ramps are controlled via signs or traffic signals. One of the roadways will include a <span class="SmallCaps">bridge</span>, also called an overpass, to achieve the grade separation. Highway bridges have many features to be observed from the outside.</p>
<p>The bridge’s <em>superstructure</em> includes the <span class="SmallCaps">beams</span>, structural members that support the <span class="SmallCaps">deck</span> upon which vehicles drive. The bridge’s weight and all the cars and trucks on top must be transferred to the bridge’s foundation. This is accomplished by the <em>substructure</em>. <span class="SmallCaps">Abutments</span> provide support to the beams at each end of the bridge, accommodating the horizontal and vertical loads of the superstructure. The intermediate supports between each of the bridge’s spans are called <span class="SmallCaps">piers</span> when consisting of a single column and <em>bents</em> when a frame of multiple columns is used. They are usually designed to handle only vertical loads to be simpler and smaller than the two abutments. In some cases, the piers include <span class="SmallCaps">caps</span> to distribute the forces across each beam and column evenly.</p>
<p>Bridges may seem like static structures, but they must be somewhat flexible. Vibrations from vehicles, settlement of the foundation, expansion and contraction due to temperature, and even forces from the wind can introduce small movements in the superstructure. Rather than make the bridge stiff enough to withstand even the tiniest motion, most bridges use <span class="SmallCaps">bearings</span> to accommodate this movement, often made from layers of rubber and steel. These pads can transfer the loads of the bridge while still allowing some movement of the superstructure.</p>
<p>The transition between an at-grade roadway and a bridge is called the <span class="SmallCaps">approach</span>, and it usually consists of an earthen <span class="SmallCaps">embankment</span>. Soil is compacted in layers to create a smooth path up to the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_92" title="92"/>bridge. Earth isn’t stable with a vertical face, so embankments often have <span class="SmallCaps">slopes</span> on each side. The slopes are generally covered in grass to protect against soil erosion. However, grass doesn’t grow well in the shady areas below a bridge. Concrete slabs, called <span class="SmallCaps">slope paving</span>, are often installed on the sloped soil faces below a bridge as armoring against erosion. (Chapter 4 includes further details about bridges.)</p>
<p>One problem with a sloped embankment is how much space it takes up. In urban areas, approach embankments frequently rely on <span class="SmallCaps">retaining walls</span> for support, freeing up valuable space. These retaining walls often consist of <span class="SmallCaps">reinforcing elements</span> layered into the embankment with interlocking concrete <span class="SmallCaps">facing panels</span>, a technique called <em>mechanically stabilized earth</em>. (See the previous section for more information about retaining walls.)</p>
<p>Interchanges become more complicated when two or more highways meet. The ideal junction allows each traffic stream to transition onto any crossing roadway in any direction without interruption. There are many ways to accomplish such connectivity, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. One of the most basic types is the <span class="SmallCaps">cloverleaf interchange</span>, named for its distinctive shape on a map. In a cloverleaf interchange, the vehicles turning <span class="SmallCaps">right</span> follow a gentle curve to transition to the crossing roadway. The <span class="SmallCaps">left</span> turners go past the intersection, then follow a sharp right-hand <span class="SmallCaps">loop</span> onto the other route in the opposite direction. Cloverleaf interchanges require only a single bridge, so they are relatively inexpensive to construct. However, they have some disadvantages too. Most significantly, the left-turn entrance ramps come before the exit ramps, forcing traffic entering and leaving the highway to weave across each other. This weaving can significantly limit the interchange’s capacity.</p>
<p>Another type of grade-separated junction is the <span class="SmallCaps">stack interchange</span>. In this type of junction, the <span class="SmallCaps">right</span> turns usually remain at grade, just like a cloverleaf. However, the <span class="SmallCaps">left</span> turns are handled by elevated ramps, often called <span class="SmallCaps">flyovers</span>. The two pairs of left-turning ramps must be stacked above or below the highways, giving this interchange its name. Stack interchanges generally have the highest capacity of all different types of four-way junctions. However, they are complex and expensive structures due to the many layers of elevated roadways required.</p>
<p>Many other types of highway interchanges exist, and most junctions found in the real world borrow elements from various designs. Urban areas put many constraints on such massive structures, including the number, size, and direction of roads connected and the available space for all those ramps (not to mention the two ever-present constraints on all infrastructure projects: schedule and budget). The largest and most complex interchanges are often referred to as <em>spaghetti junctions</em>, towering tangles of interweaving ramps transitioning traffic in every direction. On <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_93" title="93"/>road trips, I am guilty of devising my routes to make sure I pass over each interchange’s very top level to get the best (if momentary) views of the city.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">One popular material that makes up a large proportion of bridge beams is concrete. Beams made from concrete last longer and require less maintenance than those made from steel or other materials. But concrete has some weaknesses. Although strong when compressed, concrete quickly fails when subjected to tension forces, those trying to pull it apart. Bridge beams experience both tension and compression forces, so they must be able to resist both simultaneously. That’s why structural members made from concrete are reinforced with steel bars. Reinforcement within concrete creates a composite material, with the concrete providing strength against compressive stress while the reinforcement provides strength against tensile stress. For bridge beams, this reinforcement is often <em>pre-stressed</em>. The steel bars are stretched and held taut while the wet concrete is cast into a mold. Once the concrete hardens, the tension in the steel compresses it tightly like a rubber band, making the beams stiffer and less prone to cracking. These beams are constructed in factories so they can show up to a job site ready to be lifted into place.</p>

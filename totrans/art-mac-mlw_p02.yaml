    and capabilities, let’s discuss how you can effectively analyze malicious samples.
    We’ll cover both static and dynamic approaches:'

- en: '**Static Analysis:** The examination of a sample without executing it. This
    approach leverages various tools that can statically extract information from
    a sample. Often, the analysis culminates with the use of a disassembler or decompiler.'

    approach most commonly leverages passive monitoring tools, though it might employ
    more powerful tools, such as a debugger, as well.'

    malicious and, if so, answer questions such as the following: What infection vector
    does it use to infect a Mac? What, if any, persistence mechanism is used to maintain
    access? What are its ultimate objectives and capabilities?'

    malware poses to Mac users, as well as create detection, prevention, and disinfection
    mechanisms to thwart it.

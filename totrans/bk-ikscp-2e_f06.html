			<p class="ChapterIntro">This book is about Inkscape, the powerful, open source SVG-based vector graphics editor. It describes 1.1, the latest version, released in 2021 after almost two decades of development, in great detail, covering all of its features, excluding only those that are experimental or incomplete.</p>
			<p>The second, perhaps more ambitious goal of this book is to evangelize 
the vector way of creating graphics and share the joy of thinking in vector. Once the
exclusive domain of professional designers, vector graphics software has become more 
common and accessible. A vector editor is not yet a standard app in the same way a bitmap editor (like Photoshop) is, but it's getting
there—and Inkscape has been a major cause of this shift.</p>
			<p>
				Much of Inkscape's appeal is due to the fact that it's the only fully open source and cross-platform professional-level vector editor.
But that's not all. 
Simple and accessible at the basic level, Inkscape is also extremely powerful if you dig
deeper. It is vast and inexhaustibly hackable—from customizable keyboard shortcuts
(<a href="c03.xhtml#section3.4">3.4</a>) and a command line language (Appendix <a href="b03.xhtml#chC">C</a>), to powerful chainable path effects (<a href="c13.xhtml#ch13">Chapter 13</a>), to
arbitrarily complex vector filters that push the envelope of vector graphics
(<a href="c17.xhtml#ch17">Chapter 17</a>). This book swims the Inkscape ocean from shore to shore leaving no island
unvisited.</p>
			<a id="section0.1"/><h2>What's in This Book?</h2>
			<p><a href="c01.xhtml#ch1">Chapter 1</a> is a high-level description of Inkscape,
its capabilities, and its place in the world of vector graphics (and, to some extent,
computer graphics in general). Next, <a href="c02.xhtml#ch2">Chapter 2</a> gives an absolutely
down-to-the-basics primer on the first steps in the program (installation, opening,
creating objects, transforming them, and saving); you can safely skip this chapter if you have
ever completed even a small Inkscape project.</p>
			<p>
				The bulk of the book, <a href="c03.xhtml#ch3">Chapters 3</a> to <a href="c19.xhtml#ch19">19</a>, is written to be read more or less in
sequence. These chapters present all aspects of Inkscape's functionality (objects,
transformations, style, paths, text, effects, and more) with detailed explanations,
illustrations, and practical tips.</p>
			<p>
				The second part of the book (starting from <a href="c20.xhtml">Chapter 20</a>) contains several complete step-by-step
tutorials demonstrating real-world uses of Inkscape, including an animation, a business card, and a 
complex illustration of a rose in different styles. The book ends with several appendixes
that provide reference information.</p>
			<p>Inkscape is a work in progress—even if this progress may at times seem slow. The previous edition of this book
described version 0.47 and was published way back in 2009. Since then, Inkscape has evolved and matured enormously, and this new
edition brings the book up to date with that development. Here are the major features that are new in Inkscape 1.1 compared to 0.47:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Speed!</strong> Inkscape's slowness has been the number one user complaint for many years. Version 1.1 brings great improvements in rendering speed and UI responsiveness, especially with filters (<a href="c17.xhtml#ch17">Chapter 17</a>) as OpenMP multithreading is now supported for all filters.</li>
				<li><strong>New UI.</strong> Inkscape has a modernized GUI toolkit based on GTK 3 and a more usable implementation of dockable dialogs.</li>
				<li><strong>No more SVG-incompatible text.</strong> In previous versions, creating flowed (auto-wrapped) text made your file non-compliant SVG because Inkscape used an obsoleted draft SVG specification for this feature. Now, Inkscape-flowed text is valid SVG and displays correctly in all SVG-compliant renderers including web browsers (<a href="c15.xhtml#ch15">Chapter 15</a>). Also, there's a new option for autowrapping text into a column of unlimited height (<a href="c15.xhtml#section15.2.1.1">15.2.1.1</a>).</li>
				<li><strong>New tools.</strong> Eraser (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.4">14.4</a>), Spray (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.7">4.7</a>), Diagram (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.5">14.5</a>), and Gradient mesh (<a href="c10.xhtml#section10.7">10.7</a>).</li>
				<li><strong>More powerful Path tool.</strong> You can now edit multiple selected paths simultaneously.</li>
				<li><strong>Canvas conveniences.</strong> You can now use keyboard shortcuts to rotate the canvas for easier editing or drawing as well as mirror the canvas vertically or horizontally  (<a href="c03.xhtml#section3.13">3.13</a>).</li>
				<li><strong>Many new path effects and extensions.</strong> These are described in <a href="c13.xhtml#ch13">Chapter 13</a>.</li>
				<li><strong>Blend modes.</strong> These tools are now supported as a powerful way to alter how the overlapping objects in your art blend together (<a href="c17.xhtml#section17.2">17.2</a>).</li>
				<li><strong>More and better filters.</strong> Many new preset filters (<a href="c17.xhtml#section17.4">17.4</a>) are available, and you now can edit the filter area on the canvas (<a href="c17.xhtml#section17.3.1">17.3.1</a>).</li>
				<li><strong>Bitmap performance.</strong> Inkscape can now import, display, and export much larger bitmaps (<a href="c18.xhtml#ch18">Chapter 18</a>).</li>
				<li><strong>More export formats.</strong> In addition to PNG, Inkscape can export bitmaps to JPG, WebP, and TIFF (<a href="c18.xhtml#section18.6">18.6</a>).</li>

				<h2>Who Is This Book For?</h2>
			<p>This book can be your first introduction into the world of vector graphics. 
You don't need to be a graphics professional to find it useful.
You will learn some new concepts and terminology, but that should come naturally if you
practice what you study. Install Inkscape (if you haven't already) and immediately try
the techniques as you read about them in this book.</p>
			<p>Even those who are experienced in using Inkscape or another vector graphics program will find enough to chew on in this book.  I am writing from two
perspectives—that of a longtime Inkscape user and that of a developer who has contributed a lot of code to it.
I hope this dual perspective allows me to see the logic of the program's interface and behavior more clearly, and to identify its unique strong and
weak points (as well as suggest workarounds).</p>

- en: Harnessing the power of electricity is one of humanity’s greatest achievements.
    What was a luxury 100 years ago is now a critical resource for the safety, prosperity,
    and well-being of nearly everyone. In the not-too-distant past, manpower and horsepower
    were practically the only powers. Hard work was accomplished through the strength
    of living beings. It’s no wonder we humans have sought to take control of energies
    beyond our own bodies. These days, “energy” gives life to almost every aspect
    of the contemporary world, enabling our most basic physiological needs to our
    most cutting-edge technologies.

  zh: 驯服电力的力量是人类最伟大的成就之一。100年前的奢侈品，现在已经成为几乎每个人的安全、繁荣和福祉的关键资源。在不久前，人力和马力几乎是唯一的动力来源。辛勤的工作是通过生物的力量完成的。难怪我们人类一直在努力掌控超越我们身体的能量。如今，“能源”赋予了当代世界几乎每个方面的生命，从我们最基本的生理需求到最尖端的技术。
- en: Depending on how it is harnessed, stored, distributed, and used, energy can
    take many forms. On the Earth, we can trace nearly all our energy back to the
    sun. Wind and waves are created by heating of the Earth’s atmosphere. Solar light
    can be harnessed directly. Even fossil fuels like gasoline got their energy from
    the sun. Prehistoric plants captured this solar power through photosynthesis and
    were buried over millions of years, only to be tapped into by wells, extracted,
    refined, and exploded in engines, releasing the sun’s heat (along with many other
    foul byproducts) back to the planet again. Humans do a lot of converting of energy
    from one form to another for convenience and practicality, but nothing compares
    to electricity, which makes having a personal source of power possible for nearly
    everyone.

  zh: 电力网概述
- en: Electricity is remarkably different from all the other types of energy. We can’t
    hold it in our hands, and we can’t see it directly. Yet, it can accomplish incredible
    work—from physical feats to computations—nearly instantaneously. Rather than being
    a tangible manifestation of energy, such as fuels, electricity takes a more transient
    form, requiring only a connection by metal wires for transmission. The simplicity
    of moving it from one place to the next has given rise to *electrical grids*,
    huge, interconnected networks of electricity producers and users. To get a sense
    of scale, only five major power grids cover all of North America, and many of
    the world’s largest power grids encompass multiple countries.

  zh: 电力与所有其他类型的能源截然不同。我们无法将其握在手中，也无法直接看到它。然而，它可以几乎瞬间完成惊人的工作——从物理壮举到计算——而且效率极高。电力不像燃料那样是能源的有形体现，它以一种更为短暂的形式存在，仅需通过金属导线连接即可进行传输。从一个地方到另一个地方的简单移动，催生了*电力网*，一个庞大的、互联的电力生产者和用户网络。为了更好地理解其规模，整个北美仅有五大主要电网，而世界上许多最大的电网跨越了多个国家。
- en: 'In general, electricity makes its way through a series of discrete steps on
    the grid divided into three parts: generation (production of power), transmission
    (moving that electricity from centralized plants to populated areas), and distribution
    (delivering the electricity to every individual customer). Substations serve as
    the connection points between the major parts. Establishing these large interconnections
    solves a lot of challenges at once. Allowing a greater number of users and producers
    to share expensive infrastructure creates efficiency. Because power can take many
    different paths to each location, and individual power plants can step in if another
    one falls offline, reliability increases. Finally, interconnections help smooth
    out the flow of electricity.'

  zh: 一般来说，电力通过电网分为三个部分的离散步骤：发电（电力生产）、输电（将电力从集中式发电厂输送到人口密集区）和配电（将电力送到每个用户）。变电站作为主要部分之间的连接点。建立这些大型互联网络可以一次性解决许多挑战。让更多的用户和生产者共享昂贵的基础设施创造了效率。因为电力可以通过多种不同的路径到达每个地点，并且如果某个电厂出现故障，其他电厂可以替代，因此可靠性提高。最后，互联互通有助于平滑电力流动。
- en: Unlike other utilities, electricity is quite challenging to store on a large
    scale, which means power must be generated, transported, supplied, and used all
    in the same moment. The energy coursing through the wires of your home or office
    was a ray of sunshine on a solar panel, an atom of uranium, or a bit of coal or
    natural gas in a steam boiler only milliseconds ago. The electricity a single
    household uses can be quite sporadic. The more users that can be connected together,
    the more everyone’s spikes and swings in usage average out.

  zh: 与其他公用事业不同，电力在大规模存储方面相当具有挑战性，这意味着电力必须在同一时刻进行发电、运输、供应和使用。流经你家或办公室电线的电力，几毫秒前可能还只是太阳能电池板上的阳光、一个铀原子，或者蒸汽锅炉中的一块煤或天然气。单个家庭使用的电力可能非常零散。能将更多用户连接在一起，就能使每个人的用电高峰和波动平均化。
- en: Making a gigantic, one-size-fits-all electrical grid work for every type of
    power user and producer is no simple feat. You can imagine the power grid as a
    freight train going up a hill, with locomotives representing generation and freight
    representing electrical demands. All the engines must move in perfect synchrony
    to share the load. If one is slower or faster than the rest, it runs the risk
    of breaking the whole train. To make it even more challenging, the demands on
    the grid are continually changing over time like valleys and hills in the landscape.
    Power consumers turn electrical devices on and off at will, with no notification
    to the utilities. Demands peak during the day when people are using lots of electricity,
    particularly on scorching or freezing days when many are using air conditioners
    or heaters. To avoid *brownouts* and *blackouts*, generation must be continuously
    adjusted up or down to match electrical demands on the grid. This process is called
    *load following*, just like a locomotive adjusts its throttle to account for changes
    in grade along the way.

- en: Electricity customers use power in different ways. Commercial and industrial
    customers adjust their usage based on the fluctuating price of electricity, often
    running machines overnight to take advantage of the cheaper energy. Residential
    customers (who normally pay a fixed price) can be less attentive to the ebbs and

- en: Similarly, different types of power plants are able to generate electricity
    in different ways. Solar farms generate lots of electricity when the sun is up,
    but none when the sun is down. Wind farms generate electricity depending on weather,
    with peak output during times when winds are strong and consistent. Nuclear plants
    generate consistent power with little ability to ramp up or down, while other
    thermal power stations like coal or natural gas plants can adjust their output
    somewhat according to changing demands. Hydropower plants are the most responsive,
    often with the ability to start and stop generation within seconds or minutes.

- en: Grid managers perform detailed forecasts of both generation and demand to make
    sure they can maintain balance between the two. They have to consider when to
    schedule outages of power plants and transmission lines for maintenance and quickly
    adjust when facilities trip offline without notice due to damage or other issues.
    They hope for the best but plan for the worst, taking into account the abilities
    and limitations of the entire portfolio of power producers and users. If the worst
    comes, and there is not enough electricity to meet demands, grid managers will
    require that some customers be temporarily disconnected (called *load shedding*)
    to reduce demands and avoid a total collapse. Normally these disconnections happen

    when the tip of the blades is moving around four to seven times the speed of the
    wind. Since larger turbines have longer blades, they rotate slower to keep the
    tip speed near this ideal range. Even though these blades seemed quite fast to
    me as a child, electrical generators need to spin much faster to operate efficiently

    the wind. If the wind vane senses a change in direction, it directs motors to
    adjust the yaw of the turbine back into the wind. Most turbines also include a
    way to adjust the angle, or pitch, of each blade. When the wind is too fast for
    the turbine to operate efficiently, the blades are furled (that is, tilted so
    only the edge of the blade faces into the wind) to reduce the forces on the turbine.
    You may wonder why, during a very windy day or a storm, all the turbines in a
    wind farm have stopped turning. In extreme winds or emergencies, operators apply
    a mechanical brake to stop the rotation and prevent damage to the equipment.

  zh: 风力发电机在正对风向时效果最佳。旧式风车使用一个大尾翼来保持这种正确的朝向，称为偏航（yaw）。现代风力发电机使用安装在机舱顶部的风速传感器来测量风速和风向。如果风向发生变化，风标会指示电机调整风力发电机的偏航，使其重新对准风向。大多数风力发电机还包括调节每个叶片角度或俯仰（pitch）的方法。当风速过快，导致风力发电机无法高效运转时，叶片会被收起（即将叶片倾斜，使其边缘面向风），以减少对风力发电机的压力。你可能会想知道，为什么在风很大的日子里，或在风暴中，风电场中的所有风力发电机都停止了转动。在强风或紧急情况下，操作人员会施加机械刹车来停止旋转，防止设备受损。
- en: 'Another aspect of a wind turbine’s efficiency is the narrow shape of the blades.
    You might think that a wider blade would allow more wind energy to be harvested,
    but consider this: if 100 percent of the power could be extracted from the wind,
    the air would have no velocity left to exit behind the blades. This would cause
    air to “pile up” and block any new wind from driving the turbine. Some wind movement
    is required to keep fresh air supplying the turbine, which means it’s never possible
    to harvest all the energy from the wind. The theoretical maximum efficiency that
    can be extracted (called the *Betz limit*) is about 60 percent. The slender blades
    of the turbine are carefully designed to capture as much energy as possible without
    slowing the air stream too much.'

  zh: 风力发电机效率的另一个方面是叶片的狭窄形状。你可能认为更宽的叶片会捕获更多的风能，但考虑一下：如果能够从风中提取100%的能量，空气就不会再有速度从叶片后方排出。这会导致空气“堆积”，并阻止新风继续驱动风力发电机。需要一些风的流动来持续为风力发电机提供新鲜的空气，这意味着永远不可能从风中提取所有能量。理论上，能够提取的最大效率（称为*贝茨极限*）大约是60%。风力发电机的纤细叶片经过精心设计，以尽可能多地捕获能量，同时不至于过多地减缓气流。

    support, but anything they touch becomes dangerously energized. If they were connected

    more popular, including those made using silicone rubber and reinforced polymers.

- en: Because of these two phenomena, each phase of a high-voltage transmission circuit
    is sometimes run as a *bundle* of smaller conductors separated by spacers rather
    than a single large one. The smaller diameter conductors are more efficient at
    transmitting alternating current since they have more area on the surface where
    the electricity prefers to travel, and the large overall diameter of the bundle
    reduces corona discharge. One way to estimate the voltage of a transmission line
    is to count the number of bundled conductors for each phase. Lines below 220 kV
    commonly use only one or two conductors, and lines above 500 kV often have three
    or more. Corona discharge is most prevalent at sharp corners and edges of metal
    surfaces, such as connections to the insulator strings. On transmission lines
    with very high voltage or in areas that receive a lot of rainfall, you may see
    corona rings attached to insulators. These rings distribute the electric field

    kV以下的线路通常只使用一根或两根导线，而500 kV以上的线路则常常使用三根或更多。电晕放电通常发生在金属表面的锐角或边缘处，例如与绝缘子串的连接部位。在高电压传输线路上，或者在降水较多的地区，你可能会看到绝缘子上装有电晕环。这些电晕环将电场分布到更大的区域，消除了锐角和边缘，从而进一步减少了电晕放电。

    in protecting equipment and workers in a substation is ensuring that stray electricity
    has somewhere to go. All substations are built with a ground grid, a series of
    interconnected copper wires buried below the surface. In the event of a fault
    or short circuit, the substation needs to be able to sink lots of current into
    the ground through this grid to trip the breakers as quickly as possible. This
    grounding grid also makes sure that the entire substation and all its equipment
    are kept at the same voltage level, called an *equipotential*. Electricity flows
    only between points of different voltage potential, so keeping everything at the
    same level ensures that touching any piece of equipment doesn’t create a flow
    of electricity through a person. The cases and support structures of every piece
    of equipment are bonded together via the grounding grid.

    A transformer mainly consists of two adjacent coils of wire. The alternating current
    of the input electricity generates magnetic fields that are focused and directed
    by a laminated core consisting of many thin sheets of iron. These magnetic fields
    couple to the adjacent coil, inducing a voltage in the output wires. The voltage
    out of the transformer is proportional to the number of loops in each coil. Transformers

    on pole tops is for when things go wrong. One common protective device is the
    fused cutout, which serves as both a circuit breaker and an isolation switch.
    The fuse automatically protects a service transformer from short circuits and
    voltage surges. If the current in the fuse gets too high, the element inside melts,
    breaking the circuit and disengaging a latch, allowing the fuse door to swing
    down. These fuses often include an explosive liner to help extinguish the arc
    that forms inside, so you might hear a loud pop if one trips nearby. It is often
    so loud that many people assume the transformer has exploded, when really it was
    protected from damage by the fuse.

  zh: 就像输电线和变电站设备一样，配电网也需要防护以应对故障和雷击。你在电杆顶部看到的大部分硬件都是在出现问题时使用的。一种常见的保护装置是熔断切断器，它既充当断路器，又充当隔离开关。熔断器自动保护服务变压器免受短路和电压浪涌的影响。如果熔断器中的电流过大，内部元件会熔化，断开电路并释放一个锁扣，允许熔断器门垂下。这些熔断器通常包括一个爆炸内衬，帮助熄灭内部形成的电弧，因此如果附近的熔断器跳闸，你可能会听到一声巨响。声音通常非常响亮，以至于许多人认为变压器爆炸了，而实际上它是通过熔断器得到保护免受损坏的。
- en: Even if the fuse in a cutout hasn’t blown, lineworkers can disengage it to isolate
    the line for maintenance or repair. However, fuses are the simplest protective
    devices. More sophisticated circuit breakers can occasionally be seen, including
    reclosers, which are usually housed in small cylindrical or rectangular canisters.
    Reclosers open when a fault is detected, then close again to test whether the
    fault has cleared. Most faults on the grid are temporary, such as lightning or
    small tree limbs making contact with energized lines. Reclosers protect transformers
    without requiring a worker to come replace a fuse for minor issues. They usually
    trip and reclose a few times before deciding that a fault is permanent and locking
    out. If you ever lose and regain electricity in a short period of time, a recloser
    is probably why. Other types of isolation switches atop utility poles help lineworkers
    perform maintenance or make repairs. Many use a mechanism to disconnect all three
    phases at once. Finally, like other parts of the grid, distribution lines use
    arresters to redirect surges in voltage from lightning strikes safely to ground.

  zh: 即使切断装置中的熔断器没有熔断，线路工人也可以将其断开，以便隔离线路进行维护或修理。然而，熔断器是最简单的保护装置。更复杂的断路器偶尔也能看到，其中包括自动重合闸，它们通常装在小型圆柱形或矩形的容器中。自动重合闸在检测到故障时会打开，然后再闭合，测试故障是否已排除。电网中的大多数故障是暂时性的，例如雷击或小树枝与带电线路接触。自动重合闸能够保护变压器，无需工人更换熔断器来处理小故障。它们通常会多次跳闸和重合，再判断故障是否永久性存在，并最终锁定。如果你在短时间内断电并恢复供电，可能正是自动重合闸的作用。其他类型的隔离开关通常安装在电力杆顶，用于帮助线路工人进行维护或修理。许多隔离开关采用机制，一次性断开三相电。最后，和电网的其他部分一样，配电线路也使用浪涌保护器，将雷击等电压浪涌安全地引导入地面。
- en: Not all distribution of grid power happens overhead. In the urban core of many
    cities, you’ll hardly see any overhead lines at all. Instead, power is run in
    ducts below the ground. Also, newer residential and commercial developments often
    elect to bury distribution lines to avoid the untidy and cluttered appearance
    of overhead wires. Using underground distribution lines is not a trivial choice,
    since they are far more expensive to install and often require more time to repair
    when damaged. However, these lines are better protected from weather and don’t
    impose on the aesthetics of the urban landscape. Even if not run continuously
    underground, it is not uncommon for a distribution line to dive belowground and
    come back up shortly after to avoid an overhead hazard or even to keep a sign
    from being obstructed.

  zh: 并不是所有的电网配电都是通过架空线路进行的。在许多城市的市区核心地带，你几乎看不见任何架空电线。相反，电力是通过地下管道传输的。此外，新的住宅区和商业开发通常选择将配电线路埋地下，以避免架空电线带来的杂乱无章的外观。使用地下配电线路并不是一个简单的选择，因为它们的安装成本要高得多，而且在损坏时修复时间通常更长。然而，这些线路能够更好地抵御天气的影响，并且不会影响城市景观的美观。即使不是完全地下铺设，配电线路也常常会在地下和地面之间切换，以避开架空的障碍物，甚至是为了避免遮挡标志。
- en: Although you can’t see underground distribution lines, you can often see where
    they start and stop. Look for utility poles with large riser conduits attached.
    Underground power lines must have an insulating jacket to protect them from moisture
    and short circuits. Insulation around conductors can’t just start and stop wherever
    because moisture could get inside from the ends. Cable terminations (colloquially
    called *potheads*) are used to seal the transition between insulated and bare
    cables.

  zh: 尽管你看不到地下配电线路，但你通常能看到它们的起点和终点。你可以找到安装有大号上升管道的电力杆。地下电力线路必须有绝缘外套，以防止它们受到潮气和短路的影响。导体周围的绝缘层不能随便在某处开始或结束，因为湿气可能会从端部渗入。电缆终端（俗称*电缆头*）用于封闭绝缘电缆与裸电缆之间的过渡。
- en: Another location where underground wires come up to the surface is at a transformer.
    Although less visually intrusive than its overhead equivalent, the pad-mounted
    distribution transformer serves as a reminder that the power grid still exists
    in areas without overhead lines. You may be curious what’s inside those green
    cabinets. It’s the exact same device as in the ones mounted overhead. The cabinet
    door provides access to the high- and low-voltage bushings just like you see on
    a pole-mounted transformer.*

  zh: 另一个地下电缆出地面的地方是变压器。虽然它比架空变压器不那么显眼，但地面安装的配电变压器仍然提醒我们，即使在没有架空电缆的地区，电网仍然存在。你可能好奇那些绿色的柜子里有什么。它和架空安装的设备完全相同。柜门提供了通往高低压套管的通道，就像你在杆上安装的变压器一样。

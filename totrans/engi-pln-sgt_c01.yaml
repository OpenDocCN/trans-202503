    What was a luxury 100 years ago is now a critical resource for the safety, prosperity,
    and well-being of nearly everyone. In the not-too-distant past, manpower and horsepower
    were practically the only powers. Hard work was accomplished through the strength
    of living beings. It’s no wonder we humans have sought to take control of energies
    beyond our own bodies. These days, “energy” gives life to almost every aspect
    of the contemporary world, enabling our most basic physiological needs to our
    most cutting-edge technologies.

    take many forms. On the Earth, we can trace nearly all our energy back to the
    sun. Wind and waves are created by heating of the Earth’s atmosphere. Solar light
    can be harnessed directly. Even fossil fuels like gasoline got their energy from
    the sun. Prehistoric plants captured this solar power through photosynthesis and
    were buried over millions of years, only to be tapped into by wells, extracted,
    refined, and exploded in engines, releasing the sun’s heat (along with many other
    foul byproducts) back to the planet again. Humans do a lot of converting of energy
    from one form to another for convenience and practicality, but nothing compares
    to electricity, which makes having a personal source of power possible for nearly
    everyone.

- en: Electricity is remarkably different from all the other types of energy. We can’t
    hold it in our hands, and we can’t see it directly. Yet, it can accomplish incredible
    work—from physical feats to computations—nearly instantaneously. Rather than being
    a tangible manifestation of energy, such as fuels, electricity takes a more transient
    form, requiring only a connection by metal wires for transmission. The simplicity
    of moving it from one place to the next has given rise to *electrical grids*,
    huge, interconnected networks of electricity producers and users. To get a sense
    of scale, only five major power grids cover all of North America, and many of
    the world’s largest power grids encompass multiple countries.

    the grid divided into three parts: generation (production of power), transmission
    (moving that electricity from centralized plants to populated areas), and distribution
    (delivering the electricity to every individual customer). Substations serve as
    the connection points between the major parts. Establishing these large interconnections
    solves a lot of challenges at once. Allowing a greater number of users and producers
    to share expensive infrastructure creates efficiency. Because power can take many
    different paths to each location, and individual power plants can step in if another
    one falls offline, reliability increases. Finally, interconnections help smooth
    out the flow of electricity.'

    scale, which means power must be generated, transported, supplied, and used all
    in the same moment. The energy coursing through the wires of your home or office
    was a ray of sunshine on a solar panel, an atom of uranium, or a bit of coal or
    natural gas in a steam boiler only milliseconds ago. The electricity a single
    household uses can be quite sporadic. The more users that can be connected together,
    the more everyone’s spikes and swings in usage average out.

    power user and producer is no simple feat. You can imagine the power grid as a
    freight train going up a hill, with locomotives representing generation and freight
    representing electrical demands. All the engines must move in perfect synchrony
    to share the load. If one is slower or faster than the rest, it runs the risk
    of breaking the whole train. To make it even more challenging, the demands on
    the grid are continually changing over time like valleys and hills in the landscape.
    Power consumers turn electrical devices on and off at will, with no notification
    to the utilities. Demands peak during the day when people are using lots of electricity,
    particularly on scorching or freezing days when many are using air conditioners
    or heaters. To avoid *brownouts* and *blackouts*, generation must be continuously
    adjusted up or down to match electrical demands on the grid. This process is called
    *load following*, just like a locomotive adjusts its throttle to account for changes
    in grade along the way.

    customers adjust their usage based on the fluctuating price of electricity, often
    running machines overnight to take advantage of the cheaper energy. Residential
    customers (who normally pay a fixed price) can be less attentive to the ebbs and
    swings of total grid demands, using electricity whenever it is most convenient.

    in different ways. Solar farms generate lots of electricity when the sun is up,
    but none when the sun is down. Wind farms generate electricity depending on weather,
    with peak output during times when winds are strong and consistent. Nuclear plants
    generate consistent power with little ability to ramp up or down, while other
    thermal power stations like coal or natural gas plants can adjust their output
    somewhat according to changing demands. Hydropower plants are the most responsive,
    often with the ability to start and stop generation within seconds or minutes.

    sure they can maintain balance between the two. They have to consider when to
    schedule outages of power plants and transmission lines for maintenance and quickly
    adjust when facilities trip offline without notice due to damage or other issues.
    They hope for the best but plan for the worst, taking into account the abilities
    and limitations of the entire portfolio of power producers and users. If the worst
    comes, and there is not enough electricity to meet demands, grid managers will
    require that some customers be temporarily disconnected (called *load shedding*)
    to reduce demands and avoid a total collapse. Normally these disconnections happen
    on a rolling basis of 15 to 30 minutes to spread out the inconvenience of lost
    service, so they are often known as *rolling outages*.

    we do have an immediate link to each one connected to the grid. There are many
    types of power plants, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages, but they
    all have one thing in common: they take some kind of energy that can be harvested
    from the natural environment and convert it into electrical energy for use on
    the grid. Many of the methods we use to generate power are just different ways
    of boiling water. Plants that use this method are called *thermal power stations*
    because they rely on heat to create steam. The steam passes through a turbine,
    which is coupled to an AC generator connected to the power grid. The speed of
    the turbine must be carefully synchronized to the frequency of the rest of the

    windows by keeping an eye out for large congregations of high-voltage transmission
    lines and the recognizable tall stacks. Pay special attention to lakes outside
    large cities as well, because they sometimes serve as a source of cooling water
    for power plants. A detailed explanation of how thermal power plants work is beyond

    gas). Coal-fired power stations are becoming less common as other fuels grow less
    expensive and, more important, are less polluting. However, coal still makes up
    a large proportion of overall electricity generation. You’ll know immediately
    if you’ve spotted a coal power station, because most of the visible infrastructure
    will be related to handling the coal itself. These plants process and burn thousands
    of tons of fuel every day, so they need lots of equipment to offload, store, crush,
    and transport the coal to the furnace and boiler.

    this much fuel efficiently is by freight train. Complex systems of railways often
    surround these plants to allow for frequent and efficient delivery of fuel. Trucks
    and barges are sometimes used to deliver fuel when railways aren’t feasible. Coal
    stackers are massive moveable conveyor belts for bulk handling of the fuel. They
    travel on tracks and use their booms to organize and create stockpiles of coal.
    Plants normally maintain several weeks’ worth of fuel to make sure they can continue
    to operate if the supply is temporarily disrupted.

    stream of fine coal powder. Coal is delivered in large chunks, so from the stockpiles,
    it must go into a crusher to reduce its size for more efficient burning. Between
    each step of the fuel handling, large covered conveyor belts transport the coal.
    Storage silos protect the crushed coal from the elements. From there, it makes
    its final journey to the furnace and boiler.

    lack of this coal handling equipment. Gas pipelines that feed these plants are
    usually underground, hidden from view, which means gas plants usually appear much
    simpler and smaller from the outside. For both coal- and gas-fired plants, the
    air from the combustion of fossil fuels is called *flue gas*, and it can carry
    dangerous pollutants like ash and nitrous oxides. Environmental regulations require
    that flue gas be rid of the worst of these pollutants before it’s released into
    the atmosphere since they can be harmful to humans and animals. Many different
    facilities are used to remove pollutants from flue gas, including *baghouses*
    that use fabric filters, electrostatic precipitators that capture particles through
    static cling, and *scrubbers* that clean the air by spraying a fine mist, catching
    dust and ash. After passing through these facilities, the flue gas can be released
    through a stack. Although these tall chimneys don’t clean the flue gas directly,
    they do help manage pollution by releasing it high enough to be dispersed in the
    air (since dilution is sometimes the solution to pollution).'

- en: One type of thermal plant does not rely on combustion of fuel. Instead, nuclear
    power stations rely on the carefully controlled *fission* of radioactive materials.
    This process happens in a nuclear reactor, often evident from the outside as a
    pressurized containment building with a domed roof. The reactor building usually
    has an outside armoring layer of thick concrete as a precaution against natural
    disasters or sabotage. A separate fuel handling building is generally used for
    receipt, inspection, and storage of nuclear fuel. Offices and controls are often
    located in an administrative building, away from the fuel and equipment. Nuclear
    plants sometimes also have a stack, but it is not for releasing flue gas. In some
    reactors, the water used to drive the turbine comes into direct contact with radioactive
    fuel, which can create gases like hydrogen and oxygen that become mildly radioactive
    themselves. The tall, solitary stack seen at some nuclear plants allows for safe
    ventilation of those gases.

    choose when the wind will blow, wind farms are less reliable than thermal power
    plants. Grid operators in areas with lots of wind turbines must rely on weather
    forecasts not only to predict electrical usage, but also to predict electricity
    production. However, unlike coal, natural gas, and uranium, wind is free and it’s

- en: Every aspect of a turbine is intended to capture as much of the energy from
    the wind as possible. An important part of a turbine’s efficiency is how fast
    the blades rotate. If they go too slowly, wind will pass through the gaps in the
    blades without providing any power. If they spin too quickly, the blades will
    block the wind, reducing the amount of power that can be harvested. I remember
    taking a tour of a wind farm as a kid and trying to race the shadow of the blades
    on the ground. I would move toward the hub’s shadow little by little until I could
    keep up with the rate of rotation. It turns out that a turbine is most efficient
    when the tip of the blades is moving around four to seven times the speed of the
    wind. Since larger turbines have longer blades, they rotate slower to keep the
    tip speed near this ideal range. Even though these blades seemed quite fast to
    me as a child, electrical generators need to spin much faster to operate efficiently
    and keep up with the alternating frequency of the grid. Most turbines use a gearbox
    to convert the slow pace of the blades to a speed more suitable for the generator.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Turbines operate at their best when facing directly into the wind. Older windmills
    used a large tail to keep this proper orientation, called yaw. Modern turbines
    use a wind sensor atop the nacelle to measure both the speed and direction of
    the wind. If the wind vane senses a change in direction, it directs motors to
    adjust the yaw of the turbine back into the wind. Most turbines also include a
    way to adjust the angle, or pitch, of each blade. When the wind is too fast for
    the turbine to operate efficiently, the blades are furled (that is, tilted so
    only the edge of the blade faces into the wind) to reduce the forces on the turbine.
    You may wonder why, during a very windy day or a storm, all the turbines in a
    wind farm have stopped turning. In extreme winds or emergencies, operators apply
    a mechanical brake to stop the rotation and prevent damage to the equipment.

- en: 'Another aspect of a wind turbine’s efficiency is the narrow shape of the blades.
    You might think that a wider blade would allow more wind energy to be harvested,
    but consider this: if 100 percent of the power could be extracted from the wind,
    the air would have no velocity left to exit behind the blades. This would cause
    air to “pile up” and block any new wind from driving the turbine. Some wind movement
    is required to keep fresh air supplying the turbine, which means it’s never possible
    to harvest all the energy from the wind. The theoretical maximum efficiency that
    can be extracted (called the *Betz limit*) is about 60 percent. The slender blades
    of the turbine are carefully designed to capture as much energy as possible without
    slowing the air stream too much.'

    facilities. It just makes sense to keep some distance between our power plants
    and cities. However, creating all the electricity far from where it’s needed presents
    a transportation challenge. You can’t load electricity onto trucks and deliver
    it to customers. Instead, it travels instantaneously from producers to users on
    wires we call transmission lines. You may be familiar enough with this concept
    if you’ve ever used extension cords to bring power to lights or devices that can’t

    conductor is perfect. You can put electricity in on one side, but you never get
    100 percent of it out at the end. That’s because all conductors have some *resistance*
    to the flow of electricity. This resistance converts some of the electricity to
    heat, wasting its power along the way. Generating electricity is a costly and
    complex process, so if we’re going to go to all that trouble, we want to make
    sure that as much of it as possible actually reaches the customers for whom it’s

    wasted from the resistance of transmission lines, but it requires understanding

    the amount of electric potential (somewhat equivalent to the pressure of a fluid
    in a pipe), and *current* is the flow rate of an electric charge (like the flow
    rate of a fluid in a pipe). These two properties are related to the total amount
    of power traveling through a line. The amount of wasted power from resistance
    is related to the current in the line, so more current means more wastage. If
    you increase the voltage of the electricity, you need less current to deliver
    the same amount of power, so that’s exactly what we do. Transformers at power
    plants boost the voltage before sending electricity on its way over transmission
    lines, which reduces the current in the lines, minimizes energy wasted due to
    resistance of the conductors, and ensures that as much power as possible reaches

    line, leading to a massive variety of shapes, sizes, and materials used for these
    towers. One of the most fundamental of those is the voltage of the line. The higher
    the voltage, the more distance required between each phase and above the ground.
    Many transmission lines carry multiple three-phase circuits to save cost, so instead
    of three phases, you may see six or even nine. The illustration shows only a few

    expensive, so the available width to run transmission lines may be much smaller
    than for lines run across rural areas. A narrower path means arranging conductors
    vertically rather than horizontally, increasing the height (and cost) of the towers.
    Finally, there are aesthetic considerations. I find transmission towers to be
    interesting and beautiful. However, many people believe these towers create an
    imposition on the landscape, and they are sometimes considered a type of visual
    pollution. People generally tend to prefer the look of monopole structures compared

    much unbalanced force from the conductors. Stronger towers, called *tension towers*,
    are placed at locations where the line changes direction, crosses a large gap
    like a river, or requires a block to a cascading collapse that could occur if
    the conductors were to break. Differentiating between suspension and tension towers

    to ground at each tower. If you look closely, you can often see copper conductors
    at the bottom of the tower, which are connected to either separate grounding electrodes

    are almost always made from many individual strands of aluminum. Aluminum is a
    great choice because it’s lightweight, doesn’t easily corrode, and offers low
    resistance to electrical current. But, if you’ve ever crushed a soda can, you
    know that aluminum is not particularly strong compared to other materials. Transmission
    conductors not only need to carry the electricity, but they must also span great
    distances between each pylon and withstand the forces of wind and weather. They
    can also become hot when moving a great deal of electrical current. This heat
    causes the lines to sag as the metal conductors expand. If they sag too far, conductors
    can come into contact with tree branches or other obstacles, creating a dangerous
    short circuit or even starting a fire. For these reasons, aluminum cables are
    often reinforced with steel or carbon fibers for extra strength.

    of high-voltage transmission lines are bare. They have no outer jacket of insulation.
    The amount of rubber or plastic that would be required to prevent electrical arcs
    would add too much weight and cost to the wires. Instead, most of the insulation
    for high-voltage lines comes from air gaps, simply maintaining large amounts of
    space between the energized lines and anything that might serve as a path to ground.
    You might see the challenge here. The conductors can’t float in the air without
    support, but anything they touch becomes dangerously energized. If they were connected
    directly to the towers, it would create a severe hazard to anyone or anything
    on the ground (not to mention a short circuit between each phase). So, conductors
    are instead connected to each tower through long insulator strings.

    lengthen the flow path of electricity leakage if the insulator gets wet or dirty,
    reducing how much power can escape. These discs are also somewhat standardized
    in size, so counting them provides an easy way to roughly guess a line’s voltage:
    multiply the number of discs by 15 kilovolts (kV). Nonceramic insulators are becoming
    more popular, including those made using silicone rubber and reinforced polymers.

    For one, the alternating current creates a *skin effect* where most of the current
    travels around the surface of the conductor rather than evenly through the full
    area. That means increasing the diameter of a conductor doesn’t always create
    a corresponding increase in its ability to carry electricity. Also, power on the
    lines can be lost to *corona discharge*, an effect created from ionization of
    the air surrounding the conductors. Listen closely and you can occasionally hear
    the corona discharge as a sizzling sound, particularly on dewy mornings, during
    stormy weather, or in high altitudes where atmospheric pressure is low.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because of these two phenomena, each phase of a high-voltage transmission circuit
    is sometimes run as a *bundle* of smaller conductors separated by spacers rather
    than a single large one. The smaller diameter conductors are more efficient at
    transmitting alternating current since they have more area on the surface where
    the electricity prefers to travel, and the large overall diameter of the bundle
    reduces corona discharge. One way to estimate the voltage of a transmission line
    is to count the number of bundled conductors for each phase. Lines below 220 kV
    commonly use only one or two conductors, and lines above 500 kV often have three
    or more. Corona discharge is most prevalent at sharp corners and edges of metal
    surfaces, such as connections to the insulator strings. On transmission lines
    with very high voltage or in areas that receive a lot of rainfall, you may see
    corona rings attached to insulators. These rings distribute the electric field
    over a larger area, eliminating sharp corners and edges to reduce corona discharge

    failure. Over time, this vibration can fatigue the conductor material or cause
    abrasion at connections, reducing its lifespan. Replacing conductors is a big,
    expensive job, so utilities want them to last as long as possible. Dampers are
    often installed to absorb wind energy and reduce long-term damage to the wires.
    Spiral dampers are used for smaller conductors, and larger lines use suspension
    dampers, also called *Stockbridge dampers*. Not all wind is unwelcome, though.
    It also provides a beneficial effect by cooling off the wires. Conductors are
    often reinforced where they attach to insulators to give this critical element
    extra strength.

    that connect the various components together. Originally named for smaller power
    plants, *substation* has become a general term for a facility that can serve a
    wide variety of critical roles on the power grid. These roles include monitoring
    the grid’s performance to make sure nothing is awry, changing between different
    voltage levels, and providing protection against faults. The most commonly seen
    substation around cities are *step-down* facilities that convert high-voltage
    transmission to a lower, safer voltage for distribution within populated areas.

    a complex assemblage of wires and equipment. When I was a kid, I thought they
    were playgrounds (to the delight and horror of my parents). For a power-grid greenhorn,
    mentally untangling these mazes of modern electrical engineering can be challenging,
    especially because the scaffolding and support structures look so similar to the
    conductors and bus work. The simplest way to identify energized lines and equipment
    is to look for which parts are held by insulators. Eventually, you’ll be able
    to follow the current’s path as it makes its way through. Each phase of the conductors
    is highlighted in the illustration to help you trace the paths of flow. (The next

    High-voltage lines enter the substation through a support structure called a dead-end

    devices and equipment in a substation is the bus, a set of three parallel conductors
    (one for each phase). The bus is usually made from rigid overhead tubes running
    along the entire substation. The substation’s overall reliability depends on the
    arrangement of the bus because different schemes offer different amounts of redundancy.
    In the event of an equipment failure or regularly scheduled maintenance, utilities
    don’t want to shut down the entire facility, so the bus is designed to reroute
    the power around equipment that’s out of service when necessary.

    power transformers (discussed in the next section). At step-down facilities, power
    leaves the substation as individual circuits called feeders. Each feeder has its
    own circuit breaker, allowing smaller groups of customers to be isolated from
    the grid in the event of a fault. Many feeders leave the substation underground
    and resurface at a nearby utility pole for distribution to customers.

    components are more vulnerable to weather and changes in temperature, including
    relays, operating equipment, and some circuit breakers. These more sensitive pieces
    of equipment are often located within a control building at the substation. As
    with transmission lines, lightning poses a severe threat to substations. Static
    poles and lightning rods poke into the air to capture strikes and shunt them directly
    to ground, protecting costly equipment from surges. Arresters also help deal with
    the damaging effects of lightning. These devices are connected to energized lines,
    but they don’t normally conduct any current. Arresters instantly become conductors
    only when they sense a large spike in voltage, safely diverting excess electricity

    the workers who operate and maintain the equipment. One of the most critical factors
    in protecting equipment and workers in a substation is ensuring that stray electricity
    has somewhere to go. All substations are built with a ground grid, a series of
    interconnected copper wires buried below the surface. In the event of a fault
    or short circuit, the substation needs to be able to sink lots of current into
    the ground through this grid to trip the breakers as quickly as possible. This
    grounding grid also makes sure that the entire substation and all its equipment
    are kept at the same voltage level, called an *equipotential*. Electricity flows
    only between points of different voltage potential, so keeping everything at the
    same level ensures that touching any piece of equipment doesn’t create a flow
    of electricity through a person. The cases and support structures of every piece
    of equipment are bonded together via the grounding grid.

    that even the fences have wires connecting them to the subsurface grounding grid
    ensuring the equipotential extends not only to workers inside the fence, but also
    to anyone on the outside.

    that is, converting between the more efficient (but more dangerous) high voltage
    from transmission lines and the lower (and easier to insulate, although still
    quite dangerous) voltage for the smaller lines within urban areas. This conversion
    is done using a power transformer, a device that relies on the alternating current
    of the grid to function with no moving parts by taking advantage of *electromagnetism*.
    A transformer mainly consists of two adjacent coils of wire. The alternating current
    of the input electricity generates magnetic fields that are focused and directed
    by a laminated core consisting of many thin sheets of iron. These magnetic fields
    couple to the adjacent coil, inducing a voltage in the output wires. The voltage
    out of the transformer is proportional to the number of loops in each coil. Transformers
    are usually the largest and most expensive pieces of equipment in the entire substation,
    so they are easy to identify.

    bushings. They support the energized lines as they pass through the metal case
    into the transformer, protecting against short circuits. You can easily tell which
    lines are higher- and lower-voltage by the difference in the size of the bushings.
    The higher the voltage, the larger the bushings need to be to maintain enough
    distance to prevent arcs.

    to noise and heat. If you get close enough, you’ll definitely notice the low-pitched
    hum that occurs because the constantly changing magnetic fields cause vibrations
    to the components inside the transformer. Heat is also generated from the resistance
    in the copper coils and can eventually damage the transformer. Transformers are
    usually filled with oil to help with cooling. Radiators consisting of fans and
    heatsinks can be seen on the outer metal case to dissipate heat and help keep
    the oil and components cool. You may even see a smaller tank (called a conservator)
    on top of a transformer case to hold extra oil and allow the fluid to expand and
    contract.

    Disconnect switches are usually installed on each side of the equipment for this
    reason. They can’t interrupt large currents through the system and are used strictly
    for isolating equipment to keep workers safe. The most common disconnect switches
    are motor-operated and consist of a hinged blade and a stationary contact, both
    of which are mounted on insulators. Pantograph disconnect switches raise and lower

- en: On occasion, it is necessary to interrupt the flow of electricity on some part
    of the power grid. Most commonly, interruption is needed due to a fault, which
    can cause significant damage to costly and vital equipment. Circuit breakers provide
    the means to stop the flow of electricity, allowing faults to be isolated from
    the rest of the system. They not only protect the other equipment on the grid,
    but also make problems easy to find and repair quickly. Interrupting current on
    energized lines isn’t as simple as it sounds, though. Just about anything can
    conduct electricity if the voltage is high enough, and that includes air. Even
    if you create a break in the line to disconnect it, electricity can continue flowing
    through the air in a phenomenon known as an *arc*. Arcs need to be extinguished
    as quickly as possible to prevent damage to the breaker or unsafe conditions for
    workers, which means all circuit breakers for high-voltage equipment need to include
    some type of arc suppression.

    vacuum to avoid electricity conducting in the air between the contacts. For higher
    voltage, breakers are often submerged in tanks filled with nonconductive oil or
    dense gas called sulfur hexafluoride (SF[6]). Another option is to use a massive
    blast of air to blow out the arc. All breakers are connected to devices called
    *relays* that can automatically trigger during a fault condition. Breakers can
    also be manually operated to remove a circuit from service as needed for maintenance
    or to shed load during periods of extreme electrical demand. Because many faults
    are temporary (for example, lightning strikes), some breakers, called *reclosers*,
    automatically reenergize the circuit if the fault has cleared.

    instrument transformers convert the high voltages and currents on the conductors
    to smaller, safer levels that can be sent to the relays. Instrument transformers
    are the eyes of the power grid, monitoring conditions to make sure everything
    is working properly. Although they look similar, there’s an easy way to tell them
    apart: the primary coil for voltage transformers is usually connected between
    one phase and ground, so you’ll only see one high-voltage terminal. The primary
    coil for a current transformer is connected inline (that is, in series) with the
    conductor, so there will be two high-voltage terminals.'

    *Distribution* describes the portion of the power grid that brings electricity

    distribution lines are the residential streets. They usually start at a substation
    where individual power lines (called feeders) fan out to connect to residential,
    commercial, and industrial customers. In some ways, distribution is nearly identical
    to high-voltage transmission. Wires are wires, after all. But in other ways, it

    Standards vary regionally, but poles of normal height are usually buried 2 to
    3 meters (6 to 9 feet) into the earth. Most utility poles have their own earth
    wire running down the pole attached to an electrode driven into the ground. This

    magnifying the force into the ground and potentially toppling it altogether. Whenever
    the horizontal forces on a pole aren’t balanced, guys are used for additional
    support. Each guy is equipped with a strain insulator to make sure that, in the

    poles are considered medium voltage and usually range from 4 kV to 25 kV. Energized
    lines are easy to identify because they are supported by insulators. Even though
    they are at a much lower voltage than transmission lines, the voltage of primary
    distribution lines is still too hazardous for use in homes and businesses. Distribution
    transformers (described more in the next section) reduce the voltage to its final
    level—often called *mains* or *secondary* *voltage*—for use by regular customers.
    The secondary service drops that connect each customer to the grid are located
    below the primary conductors. For the safety of workers, the energized lines are
    always at the top of the poles with space to work between them and other telecommunication

    circuits are loops, so they require two lines: one to supply the current and one
    to return it to the source. On high-voltage transmission lines, the electricity
    usage between each of the three phases is perfectly balanced, eliminating the
    need for a separate return path for electricity. Each pair of phases serves as
    a source and a return path at the same time. However, on the distribution side,
    it’s not always so simple. Many electrical consumers (including most residential
    homes) make use of only a single phase. In fact, on the distribution grid, the
    three phases are often split from one another to service different areas entirely.
    Look around some residential neighborhoods and you may see many poles with only
    a single primary conductor and no cross arm. Grid operators try to arrange distribution
    lines to make sure that all the loads on each phase will be roughly equal, but
    they are never perfectly in sync. These imbalances between phases necessitate
    a neutral conductor to act as a return path for stray current.'

    impact much larger areas. Engineers establish zones of protection around each
    major piece of the power grid using fuses and circuit breakers to isolate faults
    and make them easy to find and repair. These devices create “managed failures”
    where you have some loss of service at the cost of protecting the rest of the
    system (just like the breakers in your house). The goal is that isolating equipment
    when things go wrong speeds up the process and reduces the cost of making repairs
    to get customers back online. When your power goes out, it’s easy to be frustrated
    at the inconvenience, but consider also being thankful that it probably means
    things are working as designed to protect the grid as a whole and ensure a speedy
    and cost-effective repair to the fault.

    one of the most important pieces of equipment on the distribution grid serves
    to change the voltage. Although significantly lower than transmission voltages,
    primary distribution circuits are operated at many thousands of volts, still much
    higher than can be safely used in most houses and businesses. In most cases, another
    transformer (called a distribution transformer) is needed to step down the voltage

    of distribution transformer coils uses a split-phasedesign. In this configuration,
    two energized (or hot) lines are supplied to the customer with one neutral conductor
    connected to ground. One of the energized lines is inverted from the other. In
    this way, smaller appliances can use the line-to-neutral voltage, about 120 V
    nominal (170 V peak-to-peak) in most of North America. Devices requiring more
    power (such as heaters, air conditioners, and clothes dryers) can be connected
    between the two energized lines, receiving double the voltage. In residential
    settings, a single distribution transformer can often supply multiple homes. Take
    a look outside your house and you may notice you share a transformer with a few
    of your neighbors. Customers with bigger equipment (for example, large air conditioning
    units) can take advantage of all three phases on the grid. In this case, you may
    see three single-phase transformers grouped together on the same pole. Look for

    needs protection from faults and lightning strikes. Much of the hardware you see
    on pole tops is for when things go wrong. One common protective device is the
    fused cutout, which serves as both a circuit breaker and an isolation switch.
    The fuse automatically protects a service transformer from short circuits and
    voltage surges. If the current in the fuse gets too high, the element inside melts,
    breaking the circuit and disengaging a latch, allowing the fuse door to swing
    down. These fuses often include an explosive liner to help extinguish the arc
    that forms inside, so you might hear a loud pop if one trips nearby. It is often
    so loud that many people assume the transformer has exploded, when really it was
    protected from damage by the fuse.

    the line for maintenance or repair. However, fuses are the simplest protective
    devices. More sophisticated circuit breakers can occasionally be seen, including
    reclosers, which are usually housed in small cylindrical or rectangular canisters.
    Reclosers open when a fault is detected, then close again to test whether the
    fault has cleared. Most faults on the grid are temporary, such as lightning or
    small tree limbs making contact with energized lines. Reclosers protect transformers
    without requiring a worker to come replace a fuse for minor issues. They usually
    trip and reclose a few times before deciding that a fault is permanent and locking
    out. If you ever lose and regain electricity in a short period of time, a recloser
    is probably why. Other types of isolation switches atop utility poles help lineworkers
    perform maintenance or make repairs. Many use a mechanism to disconnect all three
    phases at once. Finally, like other parts of the grid, distribution lines use
    arresters to redirect surges in voltage from lightning strikes safely to ground.

    of overhead wires. Using underground distribution lines is not a trivial choice,
    since they are far more expensive to install and often require more time to repair

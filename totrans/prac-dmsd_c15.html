			<p class="ChapterIntro">Second only to air, water is the most fundamental human necessity. Without it, death comes in a matter of days. This somber biological truth makes hydration a pressing, nonnegotiable priority in almost every preparedness plan.</p>
			<p>It can be argued that water is never far away. Most human settlements have been built on the banks of rivers or other natural water sources, and even if municipal pumps or rural wells grind to a halt, relatively little infrastructure is needed for water trucks to get on the road. But this sentiment lacks nuance. Nowadays, tens of millions of people live in arid regions where water needs to be hauled from hundreds of miles away, and even in temperate climates, suburban sprawl puts many families far from the nearest river or lake. Some disasters—ranging from nuclear accidents to storms that overwhelm sewage treatment plants—can spoil surface water too. As for water trucks, their ability to reach all families in need depends on the condition of area roads and bridges, both of which can be rendered impassable by earthquakes and other natural cataclysms.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_132" title="132"/>For all these reasons and more, keeping enough water to get through at least 72 hours is strongly recommended—not just by wacky doomsayers on the internet, but by most authorities. In the United States, this guidance comes from both FEMA and many local governments.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c15-endnote-1" id="c15-noteref-1">1</a></sup> Water is cheap and shelf-stable, so there’s little reason not to heed their advice. On the flip side, because it’s a bulky and heavy good, a principled examination of our needs is of essence to avoid coming up short or wasting precious space.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c15-0001">Estimating Water Needs</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">When it comes to drinking, it’s generally believed that about 1 quart of water per day is the safe minimum for survival, provided that exertion and perspiration are kept in check. For comfort, most people settle for around 1.5 to 2 quarts a day.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c15-endnote-2" id="c15-noteref-2">2</a></sup> That said, under extreme conditions, such as for soldiers involved in strenuous physical labor in desert climates, the required daily intake may increase quite dramatically, all the way to a gallon or two.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c15-endnote-3" id="c15-noteref-3">3</a></sup></p>
			<p>
				Of course, this statistic doesn’t tell the full story. The average person in the United States uses about 80 to 100 gallons per day—most of it not for drinking, but for other domestic needs.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c15-endnote-4" id="c15-noteref-4">4</a></sup> Some water uses are discretionary; long showers, dishwashing, or watering the lawn can easily be curtailed for a couple of days or weeks, for example. But the most water-intensive activity around the home is flushing the toilet, and giving that up is a much tougher sell. Less dignified sanitation options, such as bagging waste or digging out a latrine, may be integrated into some emergency plans—more about that in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 17">Chapter 17</span>—but such solutions don’t work everywhere or might not be sustainable in the long haul.</p>
			<p>For short-term outages that last a day or two, most household uses can be put on hold, and hydration can remain the only priority. Under such assumptions, storing about 2 quarts per person per day might be a defensible choice, but this leaves little room for error. A child or a pet with a hygiene accident, a nasty heat wave, or an unexpected guest could throw a wrench in the works. With this in mind, I would aim a bit higher, and store about a gallon per household member per day; this happens to be the quantity recommended by FEMA too.</p>
			<p>When considering longer-term disasters—those that span a week or longer—sanitation, hygiene, laundry, and cooking can no longer be ignored, although you can manage your water use through careful planning. Cooking-related waste can be minimized by avoiding pasta and other water-intensive meals, for instance, while the frequency of laundry can be reduced with a small stash of antiperspirant, wet wipes, and clean undergarments reserved for the dark days. That said, even with such measures in place, it’s safer to budget perhaps two to three gallons per day when preparing for the longer haul.</p>
			<p>
				How many days’ worth of water you should actually keep on hand varies based on where you live. A generous margin of safety is wise in hot and dry regions that get minimal rainfall during the summer months. For example, a resident of Los Angeles or Las Vegas may be best served by a water plan <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_133" title="133"/>that gets them through two to three weeks; such a prolonged outage is unlikely, but the stakes are extremely high. On the flip side, a far more relaxed approach can be taken in regions less prone to drought; in the Northeast, around five to seven days might be a sensible baseline for most. A larger stockpile of water can have some utility, but the returns are diminishing, so you should carefully consider the trade-offs.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c15-0002">Household Storage Options</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">One week’s worth of water for a family of four tips the scales at a bit over 200 pounds and takes up roughly 4 cubic feet—a rather imposing presence in any bedroom closet or kitchen cabinet. It follows that in many urban and suburban homes, your available space will dictate your approach to water storage. In some situations, you might need to get creative; for example, it might be useful to browse for odd-shaped water jugs that can slide neatly under the frame of a raised bed.</p>
			<p>In households with a storage situation that isn’t particularly dire, there’s a temptation to take the path of least resistance and stock up on one-gallon jugs of spring water picked up at the grocery store. At first blush, this is a sensible choice, but I can’t in good conscience recommend this approach. The paper-thin plastics used to make these containers often develop pinhole leaks at the creases and have ruined more than their fair share of cabinets and floors. If cost is of the essence, a better option may be to recycle two-liter soda bottles. Because such containers must withstand significant pressures, they’re made out of sturdy plastics that are unlikely to leak. In contrast, reusing milk or juice jugs is not advisable, even if they appear to be made sturdily. The containers are difficult to clean properly, and the residues of organic matter can lead to unpleasant smells or worse.</p>
			<p>When convenience is more important than cost, five-gallon Scepter brand cans are a good option. Available online and at many outdoor outfitters for about $20 apiece, these containers are labeled for water and made out of food-safe plastics for added peace of mind. For unusually shaped or stackable jugs, it pays to check out WaterBrick and Aqua-Tainer products too.</p>
			<p>For readers with large families and backyard space, bulk containers may be an economical solution. Perhaps the most common choice is a 55-gallon drum, normally available for around $70 and taking up about as much room as a typical curbside trash bin. On the decidedly extreme side of the spectrum, one can also procure pallet-sized 275-gallon industrial IBC totes, or towering 500-gallon storage tanks from companies such as Poly-Mart.</p>
			<p>But before going off the deep end, it’s worth noting that most suburban households have existing stores of water within reach. For example, water-heating tanks in many US homes hold between 50 and 100 gallons and can be drained by opening a tap at the bottom of the tank; despite some sediment that may come out at first, the water should be safe to drink. Hot tubs, pools, ponds, and rainwater catchment systems can provide non-potable water for assorted domestic uses too—although drinking it would be a dicey proposition due to a variety of possible contaminants.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_134" title="134"/>For any water kept outside the home, it’s important to consider the risk of freezing. Ice is about 10 percent less dense than water, so any closed container filled to the brim is likely to rupture at the seams. A simple work-around is to leave 15 percent of headspace when filling any barrel, can, or jug that may be exposed to prolonged temperatures below 32°F.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c15-0003">Hydration on the Road</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">For those evacuating from a wildfire or hurricane, a barrel of water sitting in the backyard is of little use. Regardless of how you store the bulk of your water, at least some of it must be packed into sensibly sized containers that can be loaded into a vehicle or stashed in a backpack before you hit the road.</p>
			<p>The precise amount of water to pack should be dictated by your travel plans, but typically wouldn’t need to exceed three to four days’ worth: a bit more than needed to reach a family member, a friend, or a motel of your choice in a place less affected by the event. Remember to decide on a destination or a set of possible destinations ahead of the time. Driving off into the unknown isn’t a sound plan, and neither is pitching a tent in the wilderness in the middle of a snowstorm or in freezing rain.</p>
			<p>In rare situations, there might be no alternative to leaving home on foot; in such cases, water management involves some difficult and uncomfortable trade-offs. It’s usually impractical to carry more than two to four quarts as a part of a balanced “bug out” kit, so your plan should be to reach a hospitable location within a day. When this is impossible, filtering or chemically treating surface water can be an option, but it isn’t an ideal one. Some regions might have a dearth of sources of fresh water to begin with, and then, not all pollutants can be reliably eliminated by a simple gravity filter or a disinfecting tablet stirred into a cup.</p>
			<p>That’s not to blow the problem out of proportion. Given the choice between dehydration and drinking from a scummy pond, drinking from the pond makes sense. In temperate climates, water that looks and smells fine is usually safe, and deadly waterborne diseases are few and far between. By far the most common ailment is giardiasis, which, while unpleasant, generally resolves on its own. Every year, the media dwells on the horror stories of toxic algae or brain-eating amoebas, but serious injuries and deaths caused by such pathogens are extremely rare.</p>
			<p>Still, even if it’s just giardiasis, a bout of violent diarrhea is not a welcome addition to any plan, so water-treatment tools are a worthy addition to every basic survival kit. Although many options exist, perhaps the simplest and most portable choice is sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) tablets, commonly sold under the name of Aquatabs. Their mechanism of action is similar to water chlorination. The tablets are shelf-stable, available cheaply in bulk, and take up much less space in the backpack than LifeStraw or Katadyn filters and other solutions that are sometimes promoted on the internet.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c15-0004"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_135" title="135"/>Long-Term Storage Tips</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Water as such doesn’t go bad. It’s been around for billions of years, its cosmic origins on our planet shrouded in some mystery. Of course, bottled water purchased at the grocery store will sometimes have an expiration date printed on the bottle, but in the United States, this isn’t driven by legal requirements or health concerns; it has to do with the possibility of cosmetic defects with the packaging (such as faded inks) and the risk of plastic containers gradually imparting an undesirable smell.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c15-endnote-5" id="c15-noteref-5">5</a></sup></p>
			<p>That’s not to say that nothing can spoil your water stores. For one, any container exposed to sunlight and air will probably sooner or later grow photosynthetic algae. Most algae are harmless, but the resulting biomass may eventually begin to harbor pathogenic organisms too. For this reason, properly closing containers and keeping them out of direct sunlight is important; regular monitoring is also a good plan.</p>
			<p>
				Even in the absence of algae, organic contaminants can cause serious problems down the road. It’s important to thoroughly rinse your containers and let the water run for a while before filling them, especially when using a garden hose that harbors all kinds of microflora when not in use. Municipal tap water usually doesn’t require any further treatment, but for well water, it may be good to add about four to eight drops of regular, unscented chlorine bleach per gallon. Although this sounds wacky, it’s a safe and proven method of disinfecting potable water, endorsed for emergency use by the Centers for Disease Control.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c15-endnote-6" id="c15-noteref-6">6</a></sup></p>
			<p>In principle, properly stored water should last forever. But to minimize taste issues and other surprises, it’s advisable to rotate it every couple of years, or annually if it’s stored in a very warm place (such as the trunk of a car). To stay on the safe side, it pays to have some point-of-use treatment options too. This can be Aquatabs, a countertop water filter such as Berkey, or a way to boil several quarts a day. A repeated treatment with several drops of bleach is possible, but bleach isn’t shelf-stable—so setting some aside specifically for this purpose and then pulling it out several years later may not have the intended result.</p>

- en: From the beginning, we wanted this book to be full color. We considered it a
    shame that most books published about GIMP contained color prints in a middle
    section only—or no color at all. We are very grateful to both our publishers for
    having agreed to print in full color, despite the additional costs.

- en: 'Our debt to the GIMP developers is immense: The work they did and are still
    doing is tremendous. Moreover, we had the opportunity to ask them some questions,
    using the `gimp-user` and `gimp-developer` mailing lists and the `#gimp` IRC channel.
    They graciously responded to our questions with invaluable first-hand information
    about difficult aspects of GIMP. We’d especially like to thank Alexia Death, Michael
    Hammel, Ramón Miranda, Michael Natterer, Sven Neumann, Martin Nordholts, and Alexandre
    Prokoudine, but many others have also made a vital contribution to the project.
    Many thanks to everyone involved!'

- en: Several chapters of this book are based on an undergraduate course taught by
    Olivier from 2002 to 2008\. Thus, many examples are inspired by tutorials or other
    sources dating from that time. We would like to acknowledge our debt to the many
    people who created these tutorials (especially in [Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Logos
    and Textures") and [Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Animation")) but whose names
    we no longer remember.

- en: We would also like to thank the LATEX developers and especially Frank Mittelbach
    and Michel Goossens, authors of the *L**A**TEX Companion*, the bible for all LATEX
    users. Olivier owes a special debt to Frank, who kindly helped him to discover
    an old bug in the core of LATEX. He would also like to mention Yannis Haralambous,
    author of the definitive book about fonts and encoding, for his help in getting
    the proper quote in programming examples.

- en: We are very grateful to No Starch Press for enthusiastically accepting our book
    proposal. It is always a pleasure to correspond with Bill Pollock and Tyler Ortman.
    We are also very, very grateful to Patricia Moncorgé, from Pearson France, who
    was the first to accept our book project, including simultaneous publication in
    French and English. Discussions with her have been long, lively, and very fruitful.
    Without Patricia, this book would probably not exist.

- en: Thanks to Sondra Silverhawk, the developmental editor, and to Serena Yang, the
    production editor, at No Starch Press. Also, thank you to LeeAnn Pickrell, the
    copy editor of the English edition. The editors of the English edition spent innumerable
    hours correcting errors and language ambiguities in this thick book and improving
    its style. Special thanks to the two proofreaders, Paula L. Fleming and Riley
    Hoffman.

    clearly define her priorities so Olivier would not be kept in the dark, and Olivier
    for accepting the change of priorities so gracefully.

- en: Olivier would like to thank his wife Jacqueline, who accepted the fact that
    for many years she could see her husband only sideways, facing a computer screen.
    He’d also like to thank his colleagues of the I3S Laboratory, who read drafts
    of most of the chapters and encouraged him in this long endeavor.

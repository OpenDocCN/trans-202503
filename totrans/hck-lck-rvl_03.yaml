    in a temporary Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF)—an enclosed
    area or room suitable for working with secret documents—in eastern Baghdad. She
    was downloading half a million secret “significant activity” reports from the
    military network SIPRNet, a Department of Defense computer network used for transmitting
    classified information.

    to these databases, so she downloaded them for work purposes. Having a local copy
    would be useful in a war zone where network access can be unreliable. It wasn’t
    until later that month that she decided to leak them to the public, after realizing
    they documented American war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan. They would soon become
    some of the most significant public datasets of the 21st century. “I believe that
    if the general public, especially the American public, had access to the information
    contained within the [Iraq War Logs and Afghan War Logs], this could spark a domestic
    debate on the role of the military and our foreign policy in general,” she later
    said at her court martial hearing.

    A few weeks later, at the end of her shift on a Friday night, she slipped the
    CD into her cargo pocket and headed to her dorm, where she copied the data to
    her laptop. Eventually, she copied it to the SD card in her digital camera, and
    on January 23 she flew into the Reagan National Airport just outside of Washington,
    DC, with the SD card in hand.

    at the *Washington Post*, but she didn’t feel like they took her seriously. She
    tried the *New York Times* but managed only to leave a voicemail, and the paper
    never returned her call. Finally, she settled on WikiLeaks, a leak site founded
    in 2006 by Australian information activist Julian Assange. This turned out to
    be a great choice at the time. In addition to publishing the documents, WikiLeaks
    worked in partnership with newspapers across the world, including the *New York
    Times*, the *Guardian*, and *Der Spiegel*, to break major stories about US imperialism.
    Along with the dataset of 250,000 State Department cables known as Cablegate,
    the two datasets that Manning leaked were a catalyst for the Arab Spring, the
    2011 pro-democracy movement that led to the toppling of governments in the Middle
    East and North Africa, including the authoritarian regimes in Egypt and Tunisia.

    submit leaked documents. Today, nearly every major newsroom in the US and many

    WikiLeaks and Assange went off the rails. The group published a dataset full of
    hacked Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Clinton campaign email messages
    just in time to distract the news cycle from the infamous *Access Hollywood* audio
    clip of Trump bragging about committing sexual assault. Assange lied to the public
    about his source for this data (it was Russian military intelligence), boosting
    the conspiracy theory that Seth Rich, an unrelated Democratic Party staffer who
    was murdered in Washington, DC, was his real source. WikiLeaks also promoted the

    were involved in a child sex-trafficking ring run out of a pizza shop in DC.

    made online entertainment cheap and accessible to the public, peer-to-peer file-sharing
    services like Napster, LimeWire, and Kazaa enjoyed immense popularity because
    they made downloading pirated media and software so easy. The copyright industry
    quickly shut down these centralized services with lawsuits, but decentralized
    technologies rose from their ashes. The most popular of these is BitTorrent. In
    addition to piracy, BitTorrent is also frequently used to legally distribute large
    files like Linux operating systems, as well as massive datasets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: BitTorrent works well for sharing controversial data like BlueLeaks, because
    no one—not the US government, police departments, tech companies, internet service
    providers, or anyone else—can easily censor it. Traditionally, one computer on
    the internet hosts data (on a website, for example), and all other computers connect
    to that host to download it. If someone wants to censor that data, they only have
    to bring down that single host. With BitTorrent, however, data is hosted in *swarms*,
    a collection of computers currently sharing a specific set of files. If you want
    to download some data, you join the swarm by opening a link to the data, called
    a *torrent*, in your BitTorrent software and become a *peer*. Your BitTorrent
    software downloads pieces of the data that you need from other peers in the swarm,
    and in return, you upload pieces of data you already have to peers who need it.
    Once you have all of the data you need, you can remain in the swarm and continue
    sharing with peers as long as you keep your BitTorrent software open, making you
    a *seed*. If you have the internet bandwidth and are allowed to share the files,
    it’s generally good practice to keep seeding, especially if there are few other
    seeds.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every BitTorrent swarm needs to have at least one seed in order to enable the
    peers to finish downloading all the data. The more popular the data, the bigger
    the swarm, the faster the downloads—and the more difficult censorship becomes.
    It’s hard to block access to every peer in a swarm (swarms can grow to have tens
    of thousands of peers), and nothing stops more peers from joining. There’s no
    single entity to sue or pressure financially. Swarms often consist of computers
    distributed around the world, so national laws also can’t achieve the censorship
    they might otherwise aim for.

    agencies in the United States collected enough intelligence to learn critical
    clues about the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack before it happened. However,
    each agency kept this information to itself, failing to prevent the attack. Afterward,
    the US government decided these agencies needed to improve how they share information
    with each other. Congress directed the newly formed Department of Homeland Security
    (DHS) to create *fusion centers* across the country, collaborations between federal
    agencies like the DHS and FBI with state and local police departments, to share
    intelligence and prevent future terrorist attacks. These fusion centers are the
    source of much of the BlueLeaks data.

    already-published public sources, and more often than not unrelated to terrorism.”
    Fusion centers had also been caught infiltrating and spying on anti-war activists,

    center abuses, including spying on religious groups in violation of the First

    messages with PGP (“pretty good privacy”) encryption. This encryption method was
    first developed in 1991 to encrypt email. It has historically been very important
    in securely communicating with sources and other journalists; I used it extensively
    while reporting on the Snowden Archive. Compared to modern encrypted messaging
    apps like Signal, PGP is complicated and error-prone, so I recommend that you
    avoid it if you can and choose one of the better alternatives instead. However,

    so that it can be decrypted only with that secret key. You can then email this

<p class="noindent">Now that you know the basics of what Twine can do, let’s talk about how to use the tools we have to really tell interesting stories! We’ll look at different ways to use links, and think about how to shape our stories. We’ll also go over how to make our game look more distinct with images and fancy formatting. Then we’ll publish our first game!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s start with <em>Spider Milk</em>, a short game about visiting a monster that lives under your bed. Play along at <a href="https://nostarch.com/twinegames/"><em>https://nostarch.com/twinegames/</em></a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_20"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f044-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev21">Using Links</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In Twine games, you can use links to influence how a player thinks about and uses them in your game. Lists of links are like different choices, similar to a restaurant menu. Every decision you make affects how the player understands your game, even if it’s as simple as where you place your links and what they say.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can also use links to shape your story in different ways. Although the player can’t see your game’s entire blueprint the way you can, players experience your story differently based on the shape of your game. For example, a sequence of short passages with one or two links each feels fast: <em>bang</em>, <em>bang</em>, <em>bang!</em> In contrast, a long passage bristling with lots of different links encourages the player to linger because there are so many details to take in!</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev22"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_21"/>Making a Choice</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In many Twine games, people write their links in a list at the bottom of the passage, just as I did in <em>Interview with a Cat!</em> This approach works well in an interview game: my cat says something, you pick a question, she answers, and you pick another question.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f045-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Using a link list is best in situations in which you ask the player to choose either one thing or the other. For example, the player might need to decide whether to ride a magic dragon or a magic fruit bat, but they can’t ride both. By listing the choices side by side, you invite the player to compare them and decide.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As another example, let’s say you’re drinking tea with the monster under your bed, as in <em>Spider Milk</em>, and the monster offers you some spider milk. You could emphasize the choice by placing the links at the bottom of the passage, as shown here.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f045-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_22"/>Putting links at the bottom of a passage nudges the player to make a choice. They read through the entire passage, and when they reach the link list at the bottom, they choose an action.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">By setting all the options together in a single list, the player can more easily see how their choices will have different consequences.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev23">Exploring a Space</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You can also use links throughout your passages to describe the player’s environment. For example, here’s a description of the monster’s home in <em>Spider Milk</em>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f046-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">In this passage, the links are objects the players notice as they look around the room. When you place links in the middle of a paragraph, you show the player what to explore, such as the <em>chandelier</em> in <em>Spider Milk</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For example, clicking <strong>chandelier</strong> shows the player a chandelier and a single <em>Back</em> link at the bottom of the page. The <em>Back</em> link takes the player back to the previous passage so they can click <em>pillows</em> or <em>candles</em>, or just finish their tea. These extra details make your game more fun and engaging.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_23"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f047-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">When the player is done looking around the monster’s home, they need to decide which link to click to move the story forward.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To help the player decide how to move to the next passage, we can hint that the <em>tea</em> link is the end of this scene by setting it apart from the other links. Conversely, we place the <em>chandelier</em>, <em>pillows</em>, and <em>candles</em> links in the same paragraph to make them seem similar to each other.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The <em>tea</em> link is the only sentence in the passage that refers to time and has a sense of urgency: “Are you going to drink your tea before it gets cold?” The other links are just objects to look at, so the <em>tea</em> link invites the player to move forward.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you’re making games, think about how to present your game to affect the player’s experience. Even where links appear in a passage can affect how the player makes decisions.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f047-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev24"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_24"/>Arranging Your Passages</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In the previous chapter, we compared the <em>Interview with a Cat!</em> game to a blueprint for a house. Houses come in all sizes: tiny ones with just a few rooms and big, luxurious mansions with patios, verandas, and secret passages—like the kind you’ll buy when you’re a rich and famous game designer.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As you’re creating a Twine game, you can move passages around by clicking and dragging them at any time. How you arrange your passages can change the flow of your story and your perspective on it. For example, here’s the blueprint from part of <em>Interview with a Cat!</em></p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f048-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">To make the interview with Encyclopedia Frown more formal, I could have lined up all the passages. But I didn’t want to, because the interview is meant to be more like a friendly conversation. To create that feeling, I made the passages crisscross and connect in different ways.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you’re adding passages to your Twine games, think of your story as a house and your players as visitors. Where should your visitors go when they step into your game? How do they get around? Twine <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_25"/>makes it easy to see your story as a map. Take advantage of this feature when you’re thinking about your game’s layout.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev25">Sample Layout of a Twine Game</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Let’s walk through how we might think about writing a game set at a party in a mansion. Maybe the entrance to the mansion is a grand entry foyer: a big, fancy room designed to impress visitors. But there’s nothing for a player to do in the foyer other than hang up their coats: it’s a place of transitions.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The foyer draws the player forward toward the center of the house. They step into the main hall, another big room, full of people. A party is going on here with lots of people mingling and introducing themselves. It’s loud and crowded. The player can’t really get to know anyone here, but there are doors leading to smaller, more intimate side rooms.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In these side rooms, the player can stop and take in some of the details <br/>around them. They can have meaningful conversations here as well. Maybe they’ll stumble upon secret passages in some of these rooms. Perhaps there’s a secret door that leads from one room to another on the other side of the house or to a secret place they can’t get to any other way. Maybe your player can find a little door to a backyard where they can get away from the party and look at the stars for a while. The possibilities are endless!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When your player finds their way back to the main hall eventually, perhaps many of the guests have moved to other parts of the mansion. Now they should have a better sense of the house’s layout and might decide to check out another wing.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f049-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_26"/>When the player decides they’ve seen enough, they might return to the foyer to leave the mansion. But because they’ve seen so many rooms in the mansion, they might think the foyer doesn’t look so big and imposing anymore. Passing through the entryway on their way out, the player remembers what it looked like when they first arrived and can reflect on how their impression has changed. They retrieve their coat. It’s time to go home.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f050-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev26">Determining the Shape and Size of Your Game</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Twine stories come in all shapes and sizes. Not all of them are like mansions with rooms to explore. Some are like waterfalls with only one main path, and all other paths branch off that path. Some are like gardens or caves.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you come up with the shape of your Twine game, decide what kind of story would fit that shape. What would a robot tea party look like or a monster at the grocery store, or what happens to missing socks?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Pay attention to where paths split and then meet again. For example, some stories branch like a tree and never come back together, which means your story can have different endings. Some stories are like chain links: they come apart, come back together, come apart again, and then come back together again, creating different paths to the same ending. Others can be straight lines, and some are like meandering rivers. Try to make stories with interesting shapes, like the one shown in the following figure.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_27"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f051-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Nudging players toward an ending</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Picture an action movie. The hero sees the villain on the roof of a tall building, probably laughing like a villain. We know that the scene is going to end with the hero confronting the villain, but how does the hero get there?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In our story, maybe the player chooses between running up the fire escape or taking the express elevator, but both branches lead to the exciting confrontation. Thoughtful story structuring allows us to nudge the player toward the scenes we decide are the most important, even if there are a few ways to get there.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Some Twine games are like gardens that players can wander in.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f051-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>A more open-ended game</em></p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_28"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f052-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">In this game shape, the player can roam through a garden looking at pretty flowers and trees, but most gardens don’t have an ending. The player can leave the garden whenever they’ve seen enough, and maybe by the time they’ve walked around the entire garden, they’ll feel like they know something about the person who planted it.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Some Twine games are like deep, winding caves with multiple paths that all lead to the same place.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f052-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Multiple paths leading to the same place</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_29"/>For example, the paths in a cave can wind around and loop back in on themselves. The player can go deeper and deeper into it until they run out of light. They’ll need to feel their way along the walls with their hands, not sure where they’re going. They can continue down different paths until they’re lost. At some point, the branches might come back together, but the player might not notice, because it’s too dark. The player keeps moving forward, and when they least expect it, they see light again!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">These are just some examples of different structures you can use in your games.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev27">Emphasizing Text</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You can style the words in your stories using italics, bold, or underlines to emphasize certain items or to change the way they look and feel. Let’s look at how to do this.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong>NOTE</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep">To learn more about ways to mark up text in your stories, view the Help option in Twine.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev28">Italicizing</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Italics are an easy way to emphasize important words in a sentence. To <em>italicize</em> text, place an asterisk (<span class="literal">*</span>) on either side of the text you want to italicize. For example, enter the following in Twine:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">"I don't know about *<span class="codeitalic1">you</span>* but *<span class="codeitalic1">I</span>* like a lot of pickles on my<br/>sandwiches. A *<span class="codeitalic1">lot</span>* of pickles."</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The resulting text will look like this in your game.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f053-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev29"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_30"/>Bolding</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Bold text is best for headings and for important words you don’t want the player to miss, like secret passwords or magic spells. Use two asterisks (<span class="literal">**</span>) around text you want to bold. For example, enter this in Twine:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">**<span class="codestrong1">Ingredients in a Good Sandwich</span>**<br/>1. Lots of pickles<br/>2. Pretty much anything else<br/>3. Bread<br/>**<span class="codestrong1">NOTE: Make sure you don't forget the pickles!</span>**</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Players should see this onscreen.</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img alt="image" src="../images/f054-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Like italics, bolding is a way to emphasize your text. Here, we used it to let the player know which words they should pay special attention to.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev30">Underlining</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You can use underlining to emphasize text, too. Enclose words in <span class="literal">&lt;u&gt;</span> and <span class="literal">&lt;/u&gt;</span> to get <span class="underline">underlined text</span>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The <span class="literal">u</span> means start underlining, and the <span class="literal">/u</span> means stop underlining.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev31">Adding Pictures</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">At the end of <em>Spider Milk</em>, there’s a little drawing of a teacup, just to put a cute little cap on the game. (I drew it in my notebook!) <em>Interview with a Cat!</em> also had pictures. You might want to use them in your games, too. Here’s how to add them.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_31"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f055-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Start by uploading the image or images you want to use to the internet. One good place to do that is on <a href="https://postimage.org/"><em>https://postimage.org/</em></a>, which lets you post images online for free. Try it now! Its home page looks like this.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f055-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">To upload a picture from your computer click <strong>Choose images</strong> and select the file on your computer. You can resize the image to be smaller if you want (if you don’t change this option, it’ll upload at its original size). The <strong>thumbnail</strong> and <strong>for websites and email</strong> sizes usually work best for Twine games.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Keep in mind that because you’re uploading an image to a public site, anyone on the internet could potentially see it. They probably won’t, but they <em>could</em>. So don’t post anything you should keep a secret, like your address, your phone number, or the combination to your secret vault full of diamonds.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_32"/>When you click <strong>Upload It!</strong>, your image should upload to the internet, and the following screen should appear.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f056-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">The important part of this page is the <strong>Direct Link</strong> option below your image. Click the <strong>copy to clipboard</strong> button next to the link to copy it. You can use this link to point to the image you saved to <a href="https://postimage.org/"><em>https://postimage.org/</em></a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now open the passage in your game where you want the picture to appear, and enter the following in the text of the passage:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&lt;img src="</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This tells Twine that you’re adding a link to an image (<span class="literal">img</span>) and where to find the image (<span class="literal">src</span>). You have to enclose links to images in quotations, so make sure you add an opening quotation mark (<span class="literal">"</span>) before the link.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Next, right-click (or hold down the <span class="smallcaps">control</span> key and click if you’re using a Mac) and paste the link you copied to the clipboard previously. Close the link line using <span class="literal">"&gt;</span>. Your finished link should look something like this:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&lt;img src="http://s11.postimg.org/ueht3xgsz/what.png"&gt;</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_33"/>The text inside the quotation marks is the link to the image that you uploaded.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Next, make sure your picture is embedded in your passage by clicking the play button icon in Twine. If you don’t see the picture, check that you’ve entered the link correctly. (It might take a second for your game to load the image from the internet.)</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f057-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>If you see this icon, check that you pasted the correct link!</em></p>&#13;
<div class="boxbgpink">&#13;
<p class="boxhead">Two Versions of Twine</p>&#13;
<p class="boxnoindent">Twine has two different versions! We’ve been using Twine 2, but you can still find Twine 1 at <a href="http://www.twinery.org/"><em>http://www.twinery.org/</em></a>. Unlike Twine 2, Twine 1 lets you embed images directly into your Twine games so you don’t have to put them on the internet to use them. So if you’re making a game with lots of images, Twine 1 might be easier to use than Twine 2. But if you’re just using a few images, it’s okay to stick with Twine 2.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev32">What You Learned</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you added a few new skills to your Twine repertoire. You explored different ways to use links to create different user experiences and different story shapes. You also learned how to italicize, bold, and underline text and how to add images to your games.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_34"/>In the next chapter, you’ll learn about scripting. Scripting involves writing secret words that the player won’t see but will let you track what they’ve done and change the story accordingly. You’ll also learn more ways to change what your games look like. Stay tuned!</p>&#13;

    abound. It’s more important than ever for everyone to understand how computers
    work. It’s especially important that kids, including those from underrepresented
    groups, know that they have the ability to write software, study computer science,
    or become computer programmers if they so choose.

    for phones and tablets—with App Inventor, while exploring key programming concepts
    along the way. We’ll create apps that send text messages, recognize speech, access
    a phone’s list of contacts, sense the phone’s location, operate the camera and
    camcorder, solve math problems, play video and sound, animate graphics, turn text
    into speech, and even respond to touch and let users draw on the screen!

    these to positively impact their communities. Kids in California developed an
    app that allows users to record and report graffiti and organize clean-up events.
    North Dakota middle school students created an app to encourage more recycling
    in their community. Middle school girls in Texas designed an app that uses the
    Global Positioning System (GPS) to guide visually impaired students around their
    school. Teens in Nigeria built an app that uses location sensing to help traffic
    cops catch offenders. Young women in Europe designed a crowdsourcing app to help
    residents find safe drinking water. A middle school boy in India developed an
    app to help parents locate their child’s school bus and check if their child is
    on the bus. The possibilities for creative problem solving are endless!

- en: In traditional programming environments, you need to type the actual code to
    develop software in a language like PHP or Java. But App Inventor lets developers
    create technology relatively quickly by dragging and dropping code blocks onto
    the screen rather than typing out code. This approach makes it easy for anyone
    to create and publish a simple app for a smartphone or tablet in under an hour.
    You can also use App Inventor to program more complex apps with high-tech mobile
    computing features in significantly less time than you can with traditional text-based
    programming environments. With App Inventor, you’ll be able to develop software
    in no time—and with fewer errors too!

    would use if you were writing code in text-based environments. This means that
    the programming concepts you learn here will help you as you start to code with

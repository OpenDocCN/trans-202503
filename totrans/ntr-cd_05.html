<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_168"/>In 1982, Lucasfilm researcher William T. Reeves was working on <em>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</em>. Much of the movie revolves around the Genesis Device, a torpedo that, when shot at a barren, lifeless planet, has the ability to reorganize matter and create a habitable world for colonization. During the sequence, a wall of fire ripples over the planet while it’s being “terraformed.” The term <strong>particle system</strong>, an incredibly common and useful technique in computer graphics, was coined in the creation of this particular effect. As Reeves put it:</p>&#13;
<div class="blockquote">&#13;
<p class="noindent"><em>A particle system is a collection of many, many minute particles that together represent a fuzzy object. Over a period of time, particles are generated into a system, move and change from within the system, and die from the system.</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Since the early 1980s, particle systems have been used in countless video games, animations, digital art pieces, and installations to model various irregular types of natural phenomena, such as fire, smoke, waterfalls, fog, grass, bubbles, and so on.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This chapter is dedicated to looking at strategies for coding a particle system and managing the associated data. How do you organize your code? Where do you store information related to individual particles versus information related to the system as a whole? The examples I’ll cover will use simple dots for the particles and apply only the most basic behaviors. However, these characteristics shouldn’t limit your imagination. Just because particle systems tend to look sparkly, fly forward, or fall with gravity doesn’t mean that yours should have those characteristics too. By building on this chapter’s framework and adding more creative ways to render the particles and compute their behavior, you can achieve a variety of effects.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In other words, the focus of this chapter is on <em>how</em> to keep track of a system of many elements. What those elements do and how they look is entirely up to you.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec40"><strong>Why Particle Systems Matter</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A particle system is a collection of independent objects, often represented by dots or other simple shapes. But why does this matter? Certainly, the prospect of modeling some of the phenomena listed (waterfalls!) is attractive and potentially useful. More broadly, though, as you start developing more sophisticated simulations, you’re likely to find yourself working with systems of <em>many</em> things—balls bouncing, birds flocking, ecosystems evolving, all sorts of things in plural. The particle system strategies discussed here will help you in all those situations.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In fact, just about every chapter from this one on includes sketches incorporating lists of objects, and that’s basically what a particle system is. Yes, I’ve already dipped my toe in the array waters in some of the previous chapters’ examples. But now it’s time to go where no array has gone before (in this book, anyway).</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_169"/>First, I want to accommodate flexible quantities of elements. Some examples may have zero things, sometimes one thing, sometimes ten things, and sometimes ten thousand things. Second, I want to take a more sophisticated, object-oriented approach. In addition to writing a class to describe a single particle, I want to write a class that describes the whole collection of particles—the particle system itself. The goal here is to be able to write a sketch that looks like this:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg209_Image_300.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="445"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">No single particle is referenced in this code, and yet the result will be full of particles flying all over the canvas. This works because the details are hidden inside the <span class="literal">ParticleSystem</span> class, which holds references to lots of instances of the <span class="literal">Particle</span> class. Getting used to this technique of writing sketches with multiple classes, including classes that keep lists of instances of other classes, will prove useful as you get to later chapters in this book.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Finally, working with particle systems is also an opportunity to tackle two other OOP techniques: inheritance and polymorphism. With the examples you’ve seen up until now, I’ve always used an array of a single type of object, like an array of movers or an array of oscillators. With inheritance and polymorphism, I’ll demonstrate a convenient way to use a single list to store objects of different types. This way, a particle system need not be a system of only one kind of particle.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec41"><strong>A Single Particle</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Before I can get rolling on coding the particle system, I need to write a class to describe a single particle. The good news: I’ve done this already! The <span class="literal">Mover</span> class from <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a> serves as the perfect template. A particle is an independent body that moves about the canvas, so just like a mover, it has <span class="literal">position</span>, <span class="literal">velocity</span>, and <span class="literal">acceleration</span> variables; a constructor to initialize those variables; and methods to <span class="literal">show()</span> itself and <span class="literal">update()</span> its position.</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_170"/><img src="../images/pg210_Image_301.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="709"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This is about as simple as a particle can get. From here, I could take the particle in several directions. I could add the <span class="literal">applyForce()</span> method to affect the particle’s behavior (I’ll do precisely this in a future example). I could also add variables to describe color and shape, or load a <span class="literal">p5.Image</span> to draw the particle in a more interesting way. For now, however, I’ll focus on adding just one additional detail: <strong>life span</strong>.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Some particle systems involve an <strong>emitter</strong> that serves as the source of the particles. The emitter controls the initial settings for the particles: position, velocity, and more. It might emit a single burst of particles, a continuous stream of particles, or some variation thereof. The new feature here is that particles born at the emitter can’t live forever. If they did, the p5.js sketch would eventually grind to a halt as the particles add up to an unwieldy number over time. As new particles are born, old particles need to be removed, creating the illusion of an infinite stream of particles without hurting the performance of the sketch.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">There are many ways to decide when a particle is ready to be removed. For example, it could “die” when it comes into contact with another object or when it leaves the frame of the canvas. For now, I’ll choose to give particles a <span class="literal">lifespan</span> variable that acts like a timer. It will start at 255 and count down to 0 as the sketch progresses, at which point the particle will be considered dead. Here’s the added code in the <span class="literal">Particle</span> class:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_171"/><img src="../images/pg210_Image_302.jpg" alt="Image" width="1126" height="832"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">With <span class="literal">lifespan</span> ranging from 255 to 0, it can conveniently double as the alpha transparency for the circle representing the particle. This way, when the particle is dead, it will have literally faded away.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">With the addition of the <span class="literal">lifespan</span> property, I’ll need one more method, one that can be queried (for a true or false answer) to determine whether the particle is alive or dead. This will come in handy when I write a separate class to manage the list of particles. Writing this method is pretty easy: I just need to check whether the value of <span class="literal">lifespan</span> is less than 0. If it is, return <span class="literal">true</span>; otherwise, return <span class="literal">false</span>:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg211_Image_304.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="276"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Even more simply, I can just return the result of the Boolean expression!</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg211_Image_305.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="131"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_172"/>Before I get to the next step of making many particles, it’s worth taking a moment to confirm that the particle works correctly. For that, I’ll create a sketch featuring a single <span class="literal">Particle</span> object at a time. Here’s the full code, with a few small additions: giving the particle a random initial velocity, as well as adding <span class="literal">applyForce()</span> to simulate gravity.</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel" id="ch4ex1"><img src="../images/pg212_Image_306.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="2299"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_173"/>This example creates only one particle at a time for the sake of simplicity and testing. Each time the particle reaches the end of its life span, the <span class="literal">particle</span> variable is overwritten with a new instance of the <span class="literal">Particle</span> class. This effectively replaces the previous <span class="literal">Particle</span> object. It’s important to understand that the previous <span class="literal">Particle</span> object isn’t so much deleted as it is no longer accessible or used within the code. The sketch essentially forgets the old particle and starts anew with the freshly created one.</p>&#13;

What are the pros and cons of this approach?</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec42"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_174"/><strong>An Array of Particles</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Now that I have a class to describe a single particle, it’s time for the next big step: How can I keep track of many particles, without knowing in advance exactly how many I might have at any given time? The answer is the JavaScript array, a data structure that stores an arbitrarily long list of values. In JavaScript, an array is actually an object created from the <span class="literal">Array</span> class, and so it comes with many built-in methods. These methods supply all the functionality I need for maintaining a list of <span class="literal">Particle</span> objects, including adding particles, removing particles, or otherwise manipulating them. For a refresher on arrays, see the JavaScript array documentation on the MDN Web Docs website (<em><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array</a></em>).</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">As I bring arrays into the picture, I’ll use a solution to <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch4exe1">Exercise 4.1</a> and assume a <span class="literal">Particle.run()</span> method that manages all of an individual particle’s functionality. While this approach also has some cons, it will keep the subsequent code examples more concise. To begin, I’ll use a <span class="literal">for</span> loop in <span class="literal">setup()</span> to populate an array with particles, then use another <span class="literal">for</span> loop in <span class="literal">draw()</span> to run each particle:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg214_Image_308.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="567"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The <span class="literal">for</span> loop in <span class="literal">draw()</span> demonstrates how to call a method on every element of an array by accessing each index. I initialize a variable <span class="literal">i</span> to <span class="literal">0</span> and increment it by <span class="literal">1</span>, accessing each element of the array until <span class="literal">i</span> hits <span class="literal">particles.length</span> and so reaches the end. As it happens, there are a few other ways to do the same thing. This is something that I both love and hate about coding in JavaScript—it has so many styles and options to consider. On the one hand, this makes JavaScript a highly flexible and adaptable language, but on the other hand, the abundance of choices can be overwhelming and lead to a lot of confusion when learning.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Let’s take a ride on the loop-de-loop roller coaster of choices for iterating over an array:</p>&#13;
<ul class="bullet">&#13;
<li class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_175"/>The traditional <span class="literal">for</span> loop, as just demonstrated. This is probably what you’re most used to, and it follows a similar syntax as other programming languages like Java and C.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">The <span class="literal">for...in</span> loop. This kind of loop allows you to iterate over all the properties of an object. It’s not particularly useful for arrays, so I won’t cover it here.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">The <span class="literal">forEach()</span> loop. This is a great one, and I encourage you to explore it! It’s an example of a higher-order function, something I’ll explain later in this chapter.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">The <span class="literal">for...of</span> loop. This is the technique I’ll expand upon next. It provides a clean and concise syntax compared to the traditional <span class="literal">for</span> loop when working with arrays of objects.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Here’s how the <span class="literal">for...of</span> loop looks:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre">function draw() {&#13;
  for (let particle of particles) {&#13;
    particle.run();&#13;
  }&#13;
}</pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">To translate this code, say <em>each</em> instead of <em>let</em>, and <em>in</em> instead of <em>of</em>. Putting it together, you get, “For each particle in particles, update and display that particle.”</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Simple, elegant, concise, lovely. But before you get too excited about <span class="literal">for...of</span> loops, take a moment and breathe, because I have some bad news: they won’t work in every situation. Yes, I love <span class="literal">for...of</span> loops, and I’ll use them in some of the upcoming examples to iterate over the items in an array, but not just yet. Ultimately, I want to create a continuous stream of particles, with one new particle added to the array each cycle through <span class="literal">draw()</span> and old particles removed from the array as they die. As you’ll soon see, this is where the <span class="literal">for...of</span> loop lets me down.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Creating a new particle every frame is easy: I can just call the <span class="literal">Array</span> class’s <span class="literal">push()</span> method during <span class="literal">draw()</span> to add a new <span class="literal">Particle</span> object to the end of the array. This eliminates the need to create any particles during <span class="literal">setup()</span>:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg215_Image_309.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="577"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_176"/>Run this code for a few minutes and you’ll start to see the frame rate slow further and further until the program grinds to a halt. (My tests yielded horrific performance after 15 minutes.) The issue, of course, is that I’m adding more and more particles without removing any.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">To fix this, I can use the <span class="literal">splice()</span> method to get rid of particles as they die. It removes one or more elements from an array starting from a given index. And this is why I can’t use a <span class="literal">for...of</span> loop here; <span class="literal">splice()</span> needs a reference to the index of the particle being removed, but <span class="literal">for...of</span> loops don’t provide such a reference. I’m stuck using a regular <span class="literal">for</span> loop instead:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg216_Image_311.jpg" alt="Image" width="1126" height="326"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Although this code will run just fine and never grind to a halt, I’ve opened up a medium-sized can of worms by trying to manipulate the contents of an array while iterating through that very same array. This is just asking for trouble. Take, for example, the following code:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg216_Image_312.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="229"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This is a somewhat extreme scenario (with flawed logic), but it proves the point. For each particle in the list, this code adds a new particle to the list, and so the <span class="literal">length</span> of the array increases. This will result in an infinite loop, as I can never increment past the size of the array!</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">While removing elements from the array during a loop doesn’t cause the sketch to crash (as it would with adding), the problem is perhaps more insidious in that it leaves no evidence. To discover the flaw, I must first establish an important fact: when an element is removed from an array with <span class="literal">splice()</span>, all <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_177"/>subsequent elements are shifted to the left. <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch4fig1">Figure 4.1</a> shows what happens when particle C (index 2) is removed. Particles A and B keep the same index, while particles D and E shift from 3 and 4 to 2 and 3, respectively.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch4fig1" src="../images/pg217_Image_313.jpg" alt="Image" width="951" height="309"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap">Figure 4.1: When an element is removed from an array, the subsequent elements shift to the left to fill the empty spot.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Consider what happens as counter <span class="literal">i</span> iterates over the elements of this array:</p>&#13;

</table>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Notice the problem? Particle D is never checked! When C is deleted from slot 2, D moves into slot 2 in its place, but <span class="literal">i</span> has already moved on to slot 3. In practice, this may not be a total disaster, since particle D will get checked the next time around through <span class="literal">draw()</span>. Still, the expectation is that the code should iterate through every single element of the array. Skipping an element is unacceptable!</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This problem has two solutions. The first is to iterate through the array backward. Since elements slide from right to left as other elements are removed, skipping an element becomes impossible. Here’s how the code looks:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg217_Image_314.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="301"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_178"/>A second solution is to use a <strong>higher-order function</strong>. This is a function that receives another function as an argument (or provides a function as its return value). JavaScript arrays use many higher-order functions. For example, a common one is <span class="literal">sort()</span>, which takes as its argument a function that defines how to compare two elements of the array and then sorts the array according to that comparison.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">With the array of particles, I can use <span class="literal">filter()</span>. This higher-order function takes a function specifying some kind of condition as an argument, checks each item in an array for that condition, and returns only the item(s) for which the given condition is true (excluding those items that return false):</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg218_Image_315.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="156"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This is more commonly written using JavaScript’s arrow notation. To learn more, you can watch my Coding Train tutorial on higher-order functions and arrow notation (<em><a href="https://thecodingtrain.com/hof">https://thecodingtrain.com/hof</a></em>).</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre">  particles = particles.filter(particle =&gt; !particle.isDead());</pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">For the purposes of this book, I’m going to stick with the <span class="literal">splice()</span> method, but I encourage you to explore writing your code with higher-order functions and arrow notation.</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel" id="ch4ex2"><img src="../images/pg218_Image_316.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="1149"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_179"/>You might be wondering why, instead of checking each particle individually, I don’t just remove the oldest particle after a certain period of time (determined by checking the <span class="literal">frameCount</span> or array length). In this example, where the particles die in the same order in which they’re born, that approach would actually work. I could even use a different array method called <span class="literal">shift()</span>, which automatically removes the first element of an array. However, in many particle systems, other conditions or interactions may cause “younger” particles to die sooner than “older” particles. Checking <span class="literal">isDead()</span> in combination with <span class="literal">splice()</span> is a nice, comprehensive solution that offers flexibility in managing particles across a variety of scenarios.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec43"><strong>A Particle Emitter</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">I’ve conquered the array and used it to manage a list of <span class="literal">Particle</span> objects, with the ability to add and delete particles at will. I could stop here and rest on my laurels, but I can and should take an additional step: writing a class describing the list of <span class="literal">Particle</span> objects itself. At the start of this chapter, I used a speculative class name <span class="literal">ParticleSystem</span> to represent the overall collection of particles. However, a more fitting term for the functionality of emitting particles is <span class="literal">Emitter</span>, which I’ll use from now on.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The <span class="literal">Emitter</span> class will allow me to clean up the <span class="literal">draw()</span> function, removing the bulky logic of looping through all the particles. As an added bonus, it will also open up the possibility of having multiple particle emitters.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Recall that one of the goals I set at the beginning of this chapter was to write <span class="literal">setup()</span> and <span class="literal">draw()</span> without referencing any individual particles. In laying out that goal, I teased the possibility of a beautifully simple main sketch file. Here it is again, only now with the <span class="literal">Emitter</span> naming convention.</p>&#13;

<p class="noindent">To get to this point, look at each piece of <span class="literal">setup()</span> and <span class="literal">draw()</span> from <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch4ex2">Example 4.2</a> and think about how it can fit into the <span class="literal">Emitter</span> class instead. Nothing about the behavior of the code should change—the only difference is how it’s organized:</p>&#13;

<p class="noindent">I could also add new features to the particle system itself. For example, it might be useful for the <span class="literal">Emitter</span> class to keep track of an origin point where particles are born. The origin point could be initialized in the constructor.</p>&#13;

<p class="noindent">The example emitter is a static source of particles, which is a nice way to begin working with particle systems. However, that’s not how it has to be. The emitter could have its own behaviors: experiencing physics, oscillating, reacting to user input, or exhibiting any other kind of motion demonstrated in previous chapters. The particles could then emanate from various positions over time, creating trails or other, more complex and intriguing patterns.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec44"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_182"/><strong>A System of Emitters</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">So far, I’ve described an individual particle and organized its code into a <span class="literal">Particle</span> class. I’ve also described a system of particles and organized the code into an <span class="literal">Emitter</span> class. This particle system is nothing more than a collection of independent <span class="literal">Particle</span> objects. But as an instance of the <span class="literal">Emitter</span> class, isn’t a particle system itself an object? If that’s the case (and it is), there’s no reason I couldn’t also build a collection of many particle emitters: a system of systems!</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">I could take this line of thinking even further, locking myself in a basement for days and sketching out a diagram of a system of systems of systems of systems of systems of systems . . . until I get this whole system thing out of my, well, system. After all, I could describe the world in a similar way: an organ is a system of cells, a human body is a system of organs, a neighborhood is a system of human bodies, a city is a system of neighborhoods, and so on and so forth. I’m not ready to go quite that far just yet, but it would still be useful to look at how to write a sketch that keeps track of many particle systems, each of which keeps track of many particles.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Consider this scenario: you start with a blank screen (<a href="ch04.xhtml#ch4fig2">Figure 4.2</a>).</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch4fig2" src="../images/pg222_Image_320.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="470"/></div>&#13;

<p class="figcap">Figure 4.4: Adding more particle systems</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">How to do this? In <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch4ex3">Example 4.3</a>, I stored a single reference to an <span class="literal">Emitter</span> object in the variable <span class="literal">emitter</span>:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre">let emitter;&#13;
&#13;
function setup() {&#13;
  createCanvas(640, 240);&#13;
  emitter = new Emitter(width / 2, 20);&#13;
}&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_184"/>&#13;
function draw() {&#13;
  background(255);&#13;
  emitter.addParticle();  &#13;
  emitter.run();&#13;
}</pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Now I’ll call the variable <span class="literal">emitters</span>, plural, and make it an array so I can keep track of multiple <span class="literal">Emitter</span> objects. When the sketch begins, the array is empty.</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel" id="ch4ex4"><img src="../images/pg224_Image_323.jpg" alt="Image" width="1126" height="793"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Whenever the mouse is clicked, a new <span class="literal">Emitter</span> object is created and placed into the array:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre">function mousePressed() {&#13;
  emitters.push(new Emitter(mouseX, mouseY));&#13;
}</pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Then, in <span class="literal">draw()</span>, instead of referencing a single <span class="literal">Emitter</span> object, I now iterate over all the emitters and call <span class="literal">run()</span> on each of them:</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec45"><strong>Inheritance and Polymorphism</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Up to now, all the particles in my systems have been identical, with the same basic appearance and behaviors. Who says this has to be the case? By harnessing two fundamental OOP principles, inheritance and polymorphism, I can create particle systems with significantly more variety and interest.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Perhaps you’ve encountered these two terms in your programming life before this book. For example, my beginner text, <em>Learning Processing</em>, has close to an entire chapter (Chapter 22) dedicated to them. Still, perhaps you’ve learned about inheritance and polymorphism only in the abstract and never had a reason to really use them. If that’s true, you’ve come to the right place. Without these techniques, your ability to program diverse particles and particle systems is extremely limited. (In <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06">Chapter 6</a>, I’ll also demonstrate how understanding these topics will help you use physics libraries.)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Imagine it’s a Saturday morning. You’ve just gone out for a lovely jog, had a delicious bowl of cereal, and are sitting quietly at your computer with a cup of warm chamomile tea. It’s your old friend so-and-so’s birthday, and you’ve decided you’d like to make a greeting card with p5.js. How about simulating some confetti? Purple confetti, pink confetti, star-shaped confetti, square confetti, fast confetti, fluttery confetti—all kinds of confetti, all with different appearances and different behaviors, exploding onto the screen all at once.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_186"/>What you have is clearly a particle system: a collection of individual pieces (particles) of confetti. You might be able to cleverly redesign the <span class="literal">Particle</span> class to have variables that store color, shape, behavior, and more. To create a variety of particles, you might initialize those variables with random values. But what if some of your particles are drastically different? It could become very messy to have all sorts of code for different ways of being a particle in the same class. Another option might be to do the following:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre">class HappyConfetti {&#13;
}&#13;
&#13;
class FunConfetti {&#13;
}&#13;
&#13;
class WackyConfetti {&#13;
}</pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This is a nice solution: create three classes to describe the different kinds of confetti that are part of your particle system. The <span class="literal">Emitter</span> constructor could then have some code to pick randomly from the three classes when filling the array (note that this probabilistic method is the same one I employed in the random walk examples in <a href="ch00.xhtml#ch00">Chapter 0</a>):</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg226_Image_326.jpg" alt="Image" width="1138" height="539"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Let me pause for a moment. You’ve done nothing wrong. All you wanted to do was wish your friend a happy birthday and enjoy writing some code. But while the reasoning behind this approach is quite sound, there’s a problem: Aren’t you going to be copying and pasting a lot of code between the confetti classes?</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_187"/>Yes, you probably will. Even though the kinds of particles are different enough to merit breaking them into separate classes, they’ll likely share a ton of code. For example, they’ll all have vectors to keep track of position, velocity, and acceleration; an <span class="literal">update()</span> function that implements the motion algorithm; and more.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This is where <strong>inheritance</strong> comes in. Inheritance allows you to write a class that takes on (<em>inherits</em>) variables and methods from another class, while also implementing its own custom features. You might also be wondering whether adding all those types of confetti to a single <span class="literal">particles</span> array actually works. After all, I don’t typically mix different kinds of objects in one array, as it could get confusing. How will the code in the <span class="literal">Emitter</span> class know which particle is which kind of confetti? Wouldn’t separate arrays be easier to manage?</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre"> constructor() {&#13;
   this.happyParticles = [];&#13;
   this.funParticles = [];&#13;
   this.wackyParticles = [];&#13;
 }</pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In fact, separating the particles into different arrays is inconvenient; a single array for all the particles in the system would be far more practical. Fortunately, the ability to mix objects of different types in one array is an inherent feature of JavaScript, and <strong>polymorphism</strong> allows the mixed objects to be operated on as if they were of the same type. I can populate an array with different kinds of particles, and each particle will still maintain its unique behaviors and characteristics as defined in its respective class.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In this section, I’ll illustrate inheritance and polymorphism in more detail, and then I’ll create a particle system that incorporates these concepts.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2sec26"><strong>Inheritance Basics</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">To demonstrate how inheritance works, I’ll take an example from the world of animals: dogs, cats, monkeys, pandas, wombats, sea nettles, you name it. I’ll start by coding a <span class="literal">Dog</span> class. A <span class="literal">Dog</span> object will have an <span class="literal">age</span> variable (an integer), as well as <span class="literal">eat()</span>, <span class="literal">sleep()</span>, and <span class="literal">bark()</span> methods:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre">class Dog {&#13;
  constructor() {&#13;
    this.age = 0;&#13;
  }&#13;
&#13;
  eat() {&#13;
    print("Yum!");&#13;
  }&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_188"/>&#13;
  sleep() {&#13;
    print("Zzzzzz");&#13;
  }&#13;
&#13;
  bark() {&#13;
    print("WOOF");&#13;
  }&#13;
}</pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Now I’ll make a cat:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg228_Image_327.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="637"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">As I move on to rewriting the same code for fish, horses, koalas, and lemurs, this process will become rather tedious. A better solution is to develop a generic <span class="literal">Animal</span> class that can describe any type of animal. All animals eat and sleep, after all. I could then say this:</p>&#13;
<ul class="bullet">&#13;
<li class="noindent">A dog is an animal and has all the properties of animals and can do all the things animals do. Also, a dog can bark.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">A cat is an animal and has all the properties of animals and can do all the things animals do. Also, a cat can meow.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Inheritance makes this possible, allowing <span class="literal">Dog</span> and <span class="literal">Cat</span> to be designated as children (<strong>subclasses</strong>) of the <span class="literal">Animal</span> class. Children automatically inherit all variables and methods from the parent (<strong>superclass</strong>), but they can also include methods and variables not found in the parent. Like a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_189"/>phylogenetic tree of life, inheritance follows a tree structure (see <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch4fig5">Figure 4.5</a>): dogs inherit from mammals, which inherit from animals, and so on.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch4fig5" src="../images/pg229_Image_328.jpg" alt="Image" width="1063" height="519"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap">Figure 4.5: An inheritance tree</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Here’s how the syntax of inheritance works:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg229_Image_329.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="1267"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_190"/>This code uses two new JavaScript features. First, notice the <span class="literal">extends</span> keyword, which specifies a parent for the class being defined. A subclass can extend only one superclass. However, classes can extend classes that extend other classes; for example, <span class="literal">Dog extends Animal</span>, <span class="literal">Terrier extends Dog</span>. Everything is inherited all the way down the line from <span class="literal">Animal</span> to <span class="literal">Terrier</span>.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Second, notice the call to <span class="literal">super()</span> in the <span class="literal">Dog</span> and <span class="literal">Cat</span> constructors. This calls the constructor in the parent class. In other words, whatever you do in the parent constructor, do so in the child constructor as well. In this case, it isn’t necessary, but <span class="literal">super()</span> can also receive arguments if a parent constructor is defined that takes matching arguments.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You can expand a subclass to include additional methods beyond those contained in the superclass. Here I’ve added the <span class="literal">bark()</span> method to <span class="literal">Dog</span> and the <span class="literal">meow()</span> method to <span class="literal">Cat</span>. You can also include additional code, besides the call to <span class="literal">super()</span>, in a subclass’s constructor to give that subclass extra variables. For example, let’s assume that in addition to <span class="literal">age</span>, a <span class="literal">Dog</span> object should have a <span class="literal">haircolor</span> variable. The class would now look like this:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg230_Image_331.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="434"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_191"/>Note that the parent constructor is first called via <span class="literal">super()</span>, which sets <span class="literal">age</span> to <span class="literal">0</span>, and then <span class="literal">haircolor</span> is set inside the <span class="literal">Dog</span> constructor.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">If a <span class="literal">Dog</span> object eats differently than a generic <span class="literal">Animal</span> object, the parent method can be <em>overridden</em> by creating a different definition for the method inside the subclass:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg231_Image_332.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="581"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">But what if a dog eats mostly the same way as a generic animal, just with some extra functionality? A subclass can both run the code from its parent class’s method and incorporate custom code:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg231_Image_333.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="667"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_192"/>Similar to calling <span class="literal">super()</span> in the constructor, calling <span class="literal">super.eat()</span> inside the <span class="literal">Dog</span> class’s <span class="literal">eat()</span> method results in calling the <span class="literal">Animal</span> class’s <span class="literal">eat()</span> method. Then the subclass’s method definition can continue with any additional, custom code.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2sec27"><strong>Polymorphism Basics</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You’ve used inheritance to create a bunch of animal subclasses. Now try to imagine how your code would manage this diverse animal kingdom with dogs, cats, turtles, and kiwis all frolicking about:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg232_Image_334.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="637"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">As the day begins, the animals are all pretty hungry and looking to eat. It’s (enhanced!) looping time:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg232_Image_335.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="456"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_193"/>This works, but as the world expands to include many more animal species, you’ll be stuck writing a lot of individual loops. Is this really necessary? After all, the creatures are all animals, and they all like to eat. Why not have just one array and fill it with all kinds of animals?</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg233_Image_336.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="699"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This is polymorphism (from the Greek <em>polymorphos</em>, meaning “many forms”) in action. Although all the animals are grouped together in an array and processed in a single <span class="literal">for</span> loop, JavaScript can identify their true types and invoke the appropriate <span class="literal">eat()</span> method for each one. It’s that simple!</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2sec28"><strong>Particles with Inheritance and Polymorphism</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Now that I’ve covered the theory and syntax behind inheritance and polymorphism, I’m ready to write a working example of them in p5.js, based on my <span class="literal">Particle</span> class. First, take another look at a basic <span class="literal">Particle</span> implementation, adapted from <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch4ex1">Example 4.1</a>:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre">class Particle {&#13;
  constructor(x, y) {&#13;
    this.acceleration = createVector(0, 0);&#13;
    this.velocity = createVector(random(-1, 1), random(-2, 0));&#13;
    this.position = createVector(x, y);&#13;
    this.lifespan = 255.0;&#13;
  }&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_194"/>&#13;
  run() {&#13;
    this.update();&#13;
    this.show();&#13;
  }&#13;
&#13;
  update() {&#13;
    this.velocity.add(this.acceleration);&#13;
    this.position.add(this.velocity);&#13;
    this.lifespan -= 2.0;&#13;
    this.acceleration.mult(0);&#13;
  }&#13;
  &#13;
  applyForce(force) {&#13;
    this.acceleration.add(force);&#13;
  }&#13;
  &#13;
  isDead() {&#13;
    return (this.lifespan &lt; 0);&#13;
  }&#13;
  &#13;
  show() {&#13;
    fill(0, this.lifespan);&#13;
    circle(this.position.x, this.position.y, 8);&#13;
  }&#13;
}</pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The class has variables and methods that any participant in a particle system should have. Next, I’ll create a <span class="literal">Confetti</span> subclass that extends <span class="literal">Particle</span>. It will use <span class="literal">super()</span> to execute the code from the parent class’s constructor and will inherit most of the <span class="literal">Particle</span> class’s methods as well. However, I’ll give <span class="literal">Confetti</span> its own <span class="literal">show()</span> method, overriding that of its parent, so <span class="literal">Confetti</span> objects will be drawn as squares rather than circles:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg234_Image_337.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="529"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_195"/>Let’s make this a bit more sophisticated. Say I want to have each <span class="literal">Confetti</span> particle rotate as it flies through the air. One option is to model angular velocity and acceleration, as described in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3</a>. For ease, however, I’ll implement something less formal.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">I know a particle has an x-position somewhere between 0 and the width of the canvas. What if I said that when the particle’s x-position is 0, its rotation should be 0; when its x-position is equal to the width, its rotation should be equal to 4π? Does this ring a bell? As discussed in <a href="ch00.xhtml#ch00">Chapter 0</a>, whenever a value has one range that you want to map to another range, you can use the <span class="literal">map()</span> function:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre">    let angle = map(this.position.x, 0, width, 0, TWO_PI * 2);</pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Here’s how this code fits into the <span class="literal">show()</span> method:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg235_Image_339.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="493"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The choice of 4π might seem arbitrary, but it’s intentional—two full rotations add a significant degree of spin to the particle compared to just one.</p>&#13;

<p class="noindent">Instead of using <span class="literal">map()</span> to calculate <span class="literal">angle</span>, try modeling angular velocity and acceleration.</p>&#13;

<p class="noindent">Now that I have a <span class="literal">Confetti</span> subclass that extends the base <span class="literal">Particle</span> class, the next step is to also add <span class="literal">Confetti</span> objects to the array of particles defined in the <span class="literal">Emitter</span> class.</p>&#13;

<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_197"/>Can you spot how this example is also taking advantage of polymorphism? It’s what allows the <span class="literal">Particle</span> and <span class="literal">Confetti</span> objects to commingle in the same <span class="literal">particles</span> array within the <span class="literal">Emitter</span> class. Thanks to the inheritance relationship, both can be considered the same type, <span class="literal">Particle</span>, and it’s safe to iterate through the array and call methods like <span class="literal">run()</span> and <span class="literal">isDead()</span> on each object. Together, inheritance and polymorphism enable a variety of particle types to be managed together in the one array, regardless of their original class.</p>&#13;

</div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec46"><strong>Particle Systems with Forces</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">So far in this chapter, I’ve focused on structuring code in an object-oriented way to manage a collection of particles. While I did keep the <span class="literal">applyForce()</span> function in my <span class="literal">Particle</span> class, I took a couple of shortcuts to keep the code simple. Now I’ll add a <span class="literal">mass</span> property back in, changing the <span class="literal">constructor()</span> and <span class="literal">applyForce()</span> methods in the process (the rest of the class stays the same):</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg237_Image_341.jpg" alt="Image" width="1139" height="615"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Now that the <span class="literal">Particle</span> class is complete, I have an important question to ask: Where should I call the <span class="literal">applyForce()</span> method? Where in the code is it appropriate to apply a force to a particle? In my view, there’s no right or wrong answer; it really depends on the exact functionality and goals of a particular p5.js sketch. My quick-and-dirty solution in the previous examples was to create and apply a <span class="literal">gravity</span> force in the <span class="literal">run()</span> method of each particle:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_198"/><img src="../images/pg238_Image_342.jpg" alt="Image" width="1138" height="261"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">I’d like to now consider a broader, more generic solution that will allow different forces to be applied to individual particles in a system. For example, what if I were to apply a force globally every time through <span class="literal">draw()</span> to all particles globally?</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre">function draw() {&#13;
  background(255);&#13;
&#13;
  /* Apply a force to all particles? */&#13;
&#13;
  emitter.addParticle();&#13;
  emitter.run();&#13;
}</pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Well, it seems there’s a small problem. The <span class="literal">applyForce()</span> method is written inside the <span class="literal">Particle</span> class, but there’s no reference to the individual particles themselves, only to <span class="literal">emitter</span>, the <span class="literal">Emitter</span> object. Since I want all particles to receive the force, however, I can pass the force to the emitter and let it manage all the individual particles:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg238_Image_343.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="312"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Of course, if I call an <span class="literal">applyForce()</span> method on the <span class="literal">Emitter</span> object in <span class="literal">draw()</span>, I then have to define that method in the <span class="literal">Emitter</span> class. In English, that method needs to be able to receive a force as a <span class="literal">p5.Vector</span> and apply that force to all the particles. Here’s the translation into code:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_199"/>  applyForce(force) {&#13;
    for (let particle of this.particles) {&#13;
      particle.applyForce(force);&#13;
    }&#13;
  }</pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">It almost seems silly to write this method. The code is essentially saying, “Apply a force to a particle system so that the system can apply that force to all the individual particles.” Although this may sound a bit roundabout, this approach is quite reasonable. After all, the emitter is in charge of managing the particles, so if you want to talk to the particles, you’ve got to talk to them through their manager. (Also, here’s a chance to use a <span class="literal">for...of</span> loop, since no particles are being deleted!)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Here’s the full example, including this change. (The code assumes the existence of the <span class="literal">Particle</span> class written earlier; there’s no need to show it again, since nothing has changed.)</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel" id="ch4ex6"><img src="../images/pg239_Image_344.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="1990"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_200"/>While this example demonstrates a hardcoded gravity force, it’s worth considering how other forces from previous chapters, such as wind or drag, could come into play. You could also experiment with varying how and when forces are applied. Instead of a force acting on particles continuously every frame, what if a force only kicked in under certain conditions or at specific moments? A lot of room remains here for creativity and interactivity in the way you design your particle systems!</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec47"><strong>Particle Systems with Repellers</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">What if I want to take my code one step further and add a <span class="literal">Repeller</span> object—the inverse of the <span class="literal">Attractor</span> object covered in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>—that pushes away any particles that get too close? This requires a bit more sophistication than uniformly applying the gravity force, because the force the repeller exerts on a particular particle is unique and must be calculated separately for each particle (see <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch4fig6">Figure 4.6</a>).</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_201"/><img id="ch4fig6" src="../images/pg241_Image_346.jpg" alt="Image" width="1007" height="419"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap">Figure 4.6: A gravity force where vectors are all identical (left) and a repeller force where all vectors point in different directions (right)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">To incorporate a new <span class="literal">Repeller</span> object into a particle system sketch, I’m going to need two major additions to the code:</p>&#13;
<ul class="bullet">&#13;
<li class="noindent">A <span class="literal">Repeller</span> object (declared, initialized, and displayed)</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">A method that passes the <span class="literal">Repeller</span> object into the particle emitter so that the repeller can apply a force to each particle object</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg241_Image_347.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="773"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_202"/>Creating a <span class="literal">Repeller</span> object is easy; it’s a duplicate of the <span class="literal">Attractor</span> class from <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch2ex6">Example 2.6</a>. Since this chapter doesn’t involve the concept of <span class="literal">mass</span>, I’ll add a property called <span class="literal">power</span> to the <span class="literal">Repeller</span>. This property can be used to adjust the strength of the repellent force:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg242_Image_348.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="571"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The more difficult task is writing the <span class="literal">applyRepeller()</span> method. Instead of passing a <span class="literal">p5.Vector</span> object as an argument, as with <span class="literal">applyForce()</span>, I need to pass a <span class="literal">Repeller</span> object into <span class="literal">applyRepeller()</span> and ask that method to do the work of calculating the force between the repeller and each particle. Take a look at both of these methods side by side:</p>&#13;
<table class="table">&#13;
<colgroup>&#13;
<col style="width:50%"/>&#13;
<col style="width:50%"/>&#13;

    particle.applyForce(force);&#13;
  }&#13;
}</pre></td>&#13;
<td><pre class="pre1">applyRepeller(repeller) {&#13;
  for (let particle of this.particles) {&#13;
    let force = repeller.repel(particle);&#13;
    particle.applyForce(force);&#13;
  }&#13;
}</pre></td>&#13;
</tr>&#13;
</tbody>&#13;
</table>&#13;
<p class="noindent">These nearly identical methods have only two differences. I mentioned one of them before: the argument to <span class="literal">applyRepeller()</span> is a <span class="literal">Repeller</span> object, not a <span class="literal">p5.Vector</span> object. The second difference is the more important one: I must calculate a custom <span class="literal">p5.Vector</span> force for each and every particle and apply that force. How is that force calculated? In a <span class="literal">Repeller</span> class method called <span class="literal">repel()</span>, it is calculated as the inverse of the <span class="literal">attract()</span> method from the <span class="literal">Attractor</span> class:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg242_Image_349.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="473"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_203"/>Notice that throughout this entire process of adding a repeller to the environment, I never once considered editing the <span class="literal">Particle</span> class itself. A particle doesn’t have to know anything about the details of its environment; it simply needs to manage its position, velocity, and acceleration, as well as have the ability to receive an external force and act on it.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">I’m now ready to write this example in its entirety, again leaving out the <span class="literal">Particle</span> class, which hasn’t changed.</p>&#13;

<p class="noindent">Notice the addition of the <span class="literal">power</span> variable in the <span class="literal">Repeller</span> class, which controls the strength of the repulsion force exerted. This property becomes especially interesting when you have multiple attractors and repellers, each with different power values. For example, strong attractors and weak repellers might result in particles clustering around the attractors, while more powerful repellers might reveal patterns reminiscent of paths or channels between them. These are hints of what’s to come in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">Chapter 5</a>, where I’ll further explore the concept of a complex system.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec48"><strong>Image Textures and Additive Blending</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Even though this book is almost exclusively focused on behaviors and algorithms rather than computer graphics and design, I don’t think I would be able to live with myself if I finished a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_206"/>discussion of particle systems without presenting an example of texturing each particle with an image. After all, the way you render a particle is a key piece of the puzzle in designing certain types of visual effects. For example, compare the two smoke simulations shown in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch4fig7">Figure 4.7</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch4fig7" src="../images/pg246_Image_354.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="251"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap">Figure 4.7: White circles (left) and fuzzy images with transparency (right)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Both images were generated from identical algorithms. The only difference is that each particle is drawn as a plain white circle in the image on the left, whereas each particle is drawn as a fuzzy blob in the image on the right. <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch4fig8">Figure 4.8</a> shows the two kinds of particle textures.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch4fig8" src="../images/pg246_Image_355.jpg" alt="Image" width="593" height="253"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap">Figure 4.8: Two image textures: an all-white circle (left) and a fuzzy circle that fades out toward the edges (right)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Using an image to texture your particles can give you a lot of bang for very little buck in terms of the realism of the visual effect. Before you write any code, however, you have to make your image texture. I recommend using the PNG format, as p5.js will retain the alpha channel (transparency) when drawing the image, which is needed for blending the texture as particles are layered on top of one another. You can create these textures in numerous ways: you can indeed make them programmatically within p5.js (I include an example on the book’s website), but you can also use other open source or commercial graphics editing tools.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Once you’ve made a PNG and deposited it in your sketch’s <em>data</em> folder, you need only a few extra lines of code.</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel" id="ch4ex8"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_207"/><img src="../images/pg247_Image_356.jpg" alt="Image" width="1126" height="488"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">First, declare a variable to store the image:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre">let img;</pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Then, load the image in <span class="literal">preload()</span>:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg247_Image_357.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="131"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Next, when it comes time to draw the particle, use the <span class="literal">img</span> variable instead of drawing a circle or rectangle:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg247_Image_358.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="253"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This smoke example is also a nice excuse to revisit the Gaussian distributions from “A Normal Distribution of Random Numbers” on <a href="ch00.xhtml#ch00lev1sec13">page 13</a>. Instead of launching the particles in a purely random direction, which produces a fountain-like effect, the result will appear more smokelike if the initial velocity vectors cluster mostly around a mean value, with a lower probability of outlying velocities.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_208"/>Using the <span class="literal">randomGaussian()</span> function, the particle velocities can be initialized as follows:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre">    let vx = randomGaussian(0, 0.3);&#13;
    let vy = randomGaussian(-1, 0.3);&#13;
    this.velocity = createVector(vx, vy);</pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Finally, in this example I’ve applied a wind force to the smoke, mapped from the mouse’s horizontal position:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg248_Image_359.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="348"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In addition to designing the texture, you should consider its resolution. Rendering a large number of high-resolution textures can significantly impair performance, especially if the code has to resize them dynamically. The ideal scenario for optimal speed is to size the texture precisely to the resolution you intend to draw the particles in the canvas. If you want particles of varying sizes, then ideally you should create the texture at the maximum size of any particle.</p>&#13;

<p class="noindent">Use an array of images and assign each <span class="literal">Particle</span> object a different image.

</div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Finally, it’s worth noting that many algorithms can be used to blend colors in computer graphics. These are often referred to as <strong>blend modes</strong>. Normally, when you draw something on top of something else in p5.js, you see only the top layer—this is the default “blend” behavior of not blending at all. Meanwhile, when pixels have alpha transparency values (as they do in the smoke example), p5.js automatically uses an alpha compositing algorithm that combines a percentage of the background pixels with the new foreground pixels, based on those alpha values themselves.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_209"/>However, drawing with other blend modes is possible. For example, a much-loved technique for particle systems is <strong>additive blending</strong>. This mode was pioneered by Robert Hodgin in his classic particle system and forces exploration, Magnetosphere (<em><a href="https://roberthodgin.com/project/magnetosphere">https://roberthodgin.com/project/magnetosphere</a></em>), which later became the visualizer for early versions of iTunes, displaying sound-responsive, animated visuals.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Additive blending is a simple blend algorithm that adds the pixel values of one layer to another, capping all values at 255. This results in a space-age glow effect, with the colors getting brighter and brighter as more layers are added together.</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel" id="ch4ex9"><img src="../images/pg249_Image_360.jpg" alt="Image" width="1126" height="487"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Before you start drawing anything, set the blend mode by using <span class="literal">blendMode()</span>:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg249_Image_361.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="614"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_210"/>Additive blending and particle systems provide an opportunity to discuss renderers in computer graphics. A <strong>renderer</strong> is the part of the code that’s responsible for drawing on the screen. The p5.js library’s default renderer, which you’ve so far been using without realizing it, is built on top of the standard 2D drawing and animation renderer included in modern web browsers. However, an additional rendering option called <span class="literal">WEBGL</span> is available. WebGL, which stands for <em>Web Graphics Library</em>, is a browser-based high-performance renderer for both 2D and 3D graphics. It utilizes additional features available from your computer’s graphics card. To enable it, add a third argument to <span class="literal">createCanvas()</span>:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel"><img src="../images/pg250_Image_362.jpg" alt="Image" width="1125" height="131"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Typically, the WebGL renderer is necessary only if you’re drawing 3D shapes in your p5.js sketch. However, even for 2D sketches, the WebGL renderer can be useful in some cases—depending on your computer’s hardware and the specific details of your sketch, it can significantly improve drawing performance. A particle system (especially one with additive blending enabled) is exactly one of these scenarios where many more particles can be drawn without slowing the sketch in <span class="literal">WEBGL</span> mode. Keep in mind that <span class="literal">WEBGL</span> mode changes the origin point for drawing, making <span class="literal">(0,0)</span> the center of the canvas rather than the top-left corner. <span class="literal">WEBGL</span> mode also changes the way some functions behave, and it may alter the quality of the rendering. Additionally, some older devices or browsers don’t support WebGL, though such instances are rare. You can learn more in the WebGL videos at the Coding Train website (<em><a href="https://thecodingtrain.com/webgl">https://thecodingtrain.com/webgl</a></em>).</p>&#13;

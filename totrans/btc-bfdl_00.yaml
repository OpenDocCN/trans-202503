    in a more-or-less timeless manner. Boy, was that hard. It would have been much
    easier to write a book called *The State of Bitcoin Right Now: Please Disregard
    Everything in This Book One Year After Its Publication*. The core technology behind
    Bitcoin, as well as the larger technological infrastructure around it, is rapidly
    evolving as this book goes to press. The debates about the legality, price volatility,
    and merchant adoption of Bitcoin may already be out of date by 2015, and who knows
    how they will sound in 2025.'

    aspects of Bitcoin that will remain important forever, and we tried to cover them
    in a way that is fun. We hope you will enjoy our approach to this fascinating
    subject.

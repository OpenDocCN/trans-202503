<p class="chapterintro">I sincerely hope this book has sparked your curiosity and passion for coding and problem-solving. However, this is just the beginning of your journey in the fascinating world of Kotlin and its applications. You can use Kotlin to tackle practical problems in almost any field of study, from science and engineering to art and entertainment.</p>
<p class="tx">This book has given you a solid foundation in Kotlin’s core features. You’re now ready to dive deep and explore more advanced topics, such as Java interoperability, generics, extension functions, and coroutines. If your goal is to become an Android app developer, you will also have to learn how to use Android Studio and Jetpack Compose for developing apps with modern and multiplatform user interfaces.</p>
<p class="tx">As before, your primary source of information is the official documentation at <span class="copyright_accent"><a href="https://kotlinlang.org" class="calibre2">https://kotlinlang.org</a></span>. However, you can choose from many excellent books that address your specific needs. No matter where your coding journey takes you next, you’ll benefit from learning about the practice of clean <span aria-label="380" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_380" role="doc-pagebreak"/>coding and design patterns for developing more complex, fully functional applications.

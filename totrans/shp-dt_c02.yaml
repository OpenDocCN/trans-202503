- en: '*Network science*, which studies entities through their relationships with
    each other, is an important interdisciplinary subject that has gained momentum
    in data science since the rise of social networks. As we saw in [Chapter 1](c01.xhtml),
    network data is “unstructured” in the usual sense of the term, but it is highly
    structured in other ways. Mathematically, networks are rooted in a subject called
    *graph theory*, which distills entities and relationships down to their abstract
    essence. Networks are geometrically rich, but their geometry is different from
    the usual Euclidean geometry of angles and straight lines. To extract insights
    from networks, we must leave the Euclidean world of spreadsheets and embrace a
    more exotic geometry where spheres look nothing like the round objects we’re used
    to seeing.'

- en: Let’s consider a social media example. Users on a platform such as Facebook
    form a network, and distance can be defined by the smallest number of friendships
    connecting two individuals. This notion of distance underpins several ways of
    measuring a user’s centrality in the network, which we can use to quantify “influencers”
    in various ways. For instance, we could count the number of friends directly connected
    to a Facebook user’s account, or we could count how many friends of friends exist.
    Someone may not have many immediate connections but may have a large number of
    friends who are well connected. In other words, a user may have a large sphere
    of influence even if their immediate circle of friends is small. The geometry
    of networks also allows us to detect outliers by measuring how improbable a user’s
    network is compared to others; this helps social media platforms automatically
    detect inauthentic accounts.

- en: A fascinating application of network-based outlier detection arose in a recent
    state supreme court case on gerrymandering. A conspicuous map of congressional
    districts in Pennsylvania prior to 2018 was widely believed to be the result of
    a partisan gerrymander favoring Republicans, but the court was not convinced until
    a team of experts brought in network science. They showed that one can view a
    districting map as a network, and by computing a random walk in the space of map
    networks to statistically probe the geometry of these networks, they found that
    the Pennsylvania map was several standard deviations away from the mean. The new
    map under consideration at the time was right in the middle of the bell curve
    of maps. They concluded that the old map was highly unlikely to have arisen organically;
    it was so unusual that it must have been deliberately engineered by the mapmakers
    (who were beholden to current Republicans in office) to increase the number of
    seats Republicans would hold. In contrast, the new map was much more typical (and
    a fair representation). The court was convinced by this network analysis and threw
    out the old map in 2018 to adopt the new one.

    simply lists, in an arbitrary order, all the edges in the network by naming the
    two vertices of each edge (if the network is directed, then the first vertex is
    considered the source and the second vertex the target). A useful package for
    working with network data in R is the igraph library (which also exists in Python
    with similar commands and syntax). To create the directed network in [Figure 2-2](#figure2-2)(b)
    from an edge list, you can use the code in [Listing 2-1](#listing2-1).

    are indexed by the vertices where 0 in the (*i, j*) entry means there is no edge
    from vertex *i* to vertex *j*, while 1 in this entry means there is such an edge.
    If the network is undirected, then the adjacency matrix is symmetric (equal to
    its own transpose, meaning it is unchanged when swapping its rows with its columns)
    because, in that case, having an edge from vertex *i* to vertex *j* is the same
    as having an edge from vertex *j* to vertex *i*. [Listing 2-2](#listing2-2) provides
    the R code to construct the preceding directed network from an adjacency matrix

    into the framework of linear algebra, where many powerful tools are available.
    For instance, we can use the spectral theory (eigenvalues and eigenvectors) of
    the adjacency matrix to measure centrality in a network. Adjacency matrices also
    readily generalize to *weighted networks*; by allowing arbitrary numbers as the
    entries (not just the binary 0 and 1 entries discussed so far), we can assign
    a real-number weight to each edge that conveys the strength of the relationship
    represented by that edge. In practice, this can be used to represent many different
    important notions: volume of calls between colleagues in a phone network, distances
    between locations in a transportation network, and so on. You can think of an
    unweighted network as a weighted network in which all the edges have a weight
    equal to 1\. In fact, this is why in [Listing 2-2](#listing2-2) we set the `weighted`

    edges in a network are *adjacent* if they have a vertex in common. A *path* in
    a network is a sequence of adjacent edges. If the network is directed, then all
    the edges in a path must be compatibly oriented. For example, in [Figure 2-2](#figure2-2)(b),
    we have a two-edge path from Sadako to Pedro to Georg and a one-edge path from
    Pedro to Georg, but going from Pedro to Sadako to Georg is not a path since the
    edges are not oriented this way.

- en: The *length* of a path has two different meanings, depending on whether the
    network is weighted or unweighted. In an unweighted network, the length of a path
    is the number of edges in the path; in a weighted network, the length is the sum
    of the weights of the edges in the path. The *network distance* between two vertices
    is the length of the minimal-length path connecting them, assuming there is a
    path from one to the other (if there is no path, the network distance is undefined).
    People—us included—usually just say “shortest” path instead of “minimal-length”
    path, because it sounds more natural. This is somewhat misleading for weighted
    networks, as the minimal-length path is actually the path with the lowest weight,
    which may not be the shortest path in terms of the number of edges in the path.
    However, that’s a minor imperfection in terminology we can all live with if we’re

    has nothing to do with network distance! The placement of the vertices in a network

    in a weighted phone network, rather than setting the weight between person A and
    person B to be the number of calls *c*[AB] between them, you should set it to
    be the reciprocal 1/*c*[AB] so that people who talk to each other more frequently

    definition is the number of edges attached to the vertex. In a directed network,
    this can be broken down into two pieces: the *in-degree* counts the number of
    edges with this vertex as the target vertex, and the *out-degree* counts the number
    of edges with this vertex as the source vertex. In a Facebook network, your degree
    is your number of friends; in Twitter, your in-degree is your number of followers,
    and your out-degree is the number of accounts you follow. Going back to [Figure
    2-3](#figure2-3), towns V2 and V3 each have degree 2, while V1 has degree 1 and
    V4 has degree 3.'

    *weighted degree*) of a vertex, which is the sum of the weights of the edges attached
    to the vertex. In [Figure 2-3](#figure2-3), towns V1, V2, V3, and V4 have strengths
    4, 14, 18, and 12, respectively. Since an unweighted network can be viewed as
    a weighted network in which all edges have weight 1, the vertex degree really
    is just a special case of strength.

    one numerical quantity most social media platforms publicly list for each account,
    and it is typically used to determine how much an influencer is paid in a marketing
    campaign to promote a product. However, it has impactful limitations. The degree
    of a vertex measures the size of that vertex’s immediate network of connections,
    but it does not capture the structure of this network nor does it look beyond
    these immediate connections. To illustrate why this matters, consider a Twitter
    user with 10,000 followers, each of whom has only a small number of followers;
    now compare this with a Twitter user who has only a few hundred followers, but
    some of these followers are highly influential users. While the first user has
    a higher degree, which user’s tweets are more likely to receive more retweets
    in the end? This example hints at how networks involve both breadth and depth,
    and degree is more focused on the former.

    or whether it’s near the periphery? The *closeness* of a vertex, defined as the
    reciprocal of the sum of network distances between this vertex and each other
    vertex in the network, is designed to capture this distinction. A vertex that
    is near the center of the network will have a relatively modest distance to the
    other vertices in the network, but a more peripheral vertex will have a modest
    distance to some vertices but a large distance to the vertices on the “opposite”
    side of the network. This means the sum of distances for a central vertex is smaller
    than the sum of distances for a peripheral vertex; reciprocating this sum flips
    this around so that the closeness score is greater for a central vertex than for
    a peripheral vertex.

    central, V2 and V3 are moderately central, and V1 is the most peripheral. Indeed,
    if we ignore the edge weights and compute the closeness scores as an unweighted
    network, we get 0.20, 0.25, 0.25, and 0.33 for V1, V2, V3, and V4, respectively.
    For instance, the closeness of V2 is 1/(1 + 1 + 2). When using the edge weights,
    we get closeness scores of 0.05, 0.06, 0.04, and 0.08, so V4 is still the most
    central, but now V3 is the most peripheral; this is because the edge weights make
    V3 have a relatively large network distance from the other vertices.

    + 1 + 2)。当使用边的权重时，我们得到的接近度得分为0.05、0.06、0.04和0.08，因此V4仍然是最中心的，但现在V3是最边缘的；这是因为边的权重使得V3与其他顶点的网络距离相对较大。

    the pair of vertices that pass through the vertex in question. When considering
    [Figure 2-3](#figure2-3) as an unweighted network, the betweenness of V1 is 0
    because no shortest paths between the remaining vertices pass through V1\. The
    same is true of V2 and V3\. The betweenness of V4, however, is 2 = 1 + 1 + 0,
    as there is one shortest path between V1 and V2 that passes through V4, there

- en: If you think of a network as encoding the ways that something (materials, information,
    disease, traffic, and so on) can travel between entities, then shortest paths
    are the most efficient travel routes. Betweenness centrality measures how disruptive
    removing a vertex would be to these routes. For example, in a shipping distribution
    network, the betweenness of a vertex indicates the number of shipping routes that
    would be impacted if a particular distribution center is shut down (not counting
    routes originating or terminating at that distribution center), weighted by the
    extent of this impact. In [Figure 2-3](#figure2-3) (viewed as an unweighted network),
    removing V1 does not affect the shipping routes among the other cities (betweenness
    score of 0), but removing V4 completely takes away two shipping routes (betweenness
    score of 2). In [Figure 2-4](#figure2-4), removing V1 impacts transportation between
    V2 and V3, but it takes out only half of the shipping routes between them (betweenness
    score of 0.5). Betweenness centrality’s use in estimating disruptive potential
    has found many practical applications; for instance, it identifies important servers
    to protect in a computer network (or which ones would be most effective to target
    in an adversarial attack!).

    to the fraction of time you spend at each vertex when doing these random walks.

    sum of the number of vertices that can be reached by a path of length 1 (this
    coincides with the degree), the number of vertices that can be reached by a path
    of length 2, the number that can be reached by a path of length 3, and so on.
    The weights in this weighted sum are determined by the length of the path and
    by a user-specified “attenuation” parameter (called *alpha*) that ranges from
    0 to 1\. More precisely, paths of length *d* are given weight *α*^(*d*). This

    overall connectivity. It turns out that eigenvector centrality is a limit of Katz
    centrality as the attenuation parameter approaches a certain value. Be careful
    when choosing the parameter alpha, though; you should always choose it to be less

    value, and the values range across the medical school cluster in a way that—at
    least intuitively—does appear to capture a notion of centrality or importance.
    Perhaps the most striking thing about this figure is the contrast between these
    two closely related eigenvector-based measures. For eigenvector centrality, the
    values in the medical school cluster completely dwarf those of the veterans organization
    cluster, whereas PageRank centrality seems better able to reflect centrality and
    importance within each of the two clusters separately. The reason for this discrepancy
    is that random walks in which one simply chooses neighboring vertices to traverse
    with equal probability tend to meander around the highly interconnected medical
    school cluster and have a low probability of taking the one edge (from V7 to V10)
    that leads out of that cluster. With PageRank centrality, the random walks include
    a fixed probability of jumping anywhere in the network, which helps them get to
    the veterans group cluster.

    a higher-order version of degree that takes into account not just the number of
    neighbors but the number of neighbors of neighbors, and so on. We compute this
    for two different values of the attenuation parameter alpha by specifying the

    choose values of alpha that are less than 0.25 (here, 0.2 and 0.1). We see here
    that both choices identified Farrelly’s V7 as the most central vertex, but for
    the higher of these two alpha parameters (left plot), the scores remain relatively
    high near V7 before dissipating rather quickly. With the smaller alpha (right
    plot), the dissipation is less sharp, and the Katz centrality scores are more
    evenly spread out across the entirety of the network. The plot on the left is
    more likely to capture what we typically think of as centrality or importance,
    and it is usually recommended to choose an alpha very close to the reciprocal
    of the spectral radius (and definitely not the default value of 1 in igraph).

    two measures coincide, so let’s first transform our network into a directed network.
    Since we don’t have a natural direction to the friendships in this social network,
    we’ll do this artificially as follows. For each edge in this network, say between
    vertex *i* and vertex *j*, with probability one out of three, we’ll convert it
    to a one-way edge from *i* to *j*, with probability one out of three, we’ll convert
    it to a one-way edge from *j* to *i*, and with probability one out of three we’ll
    leave it as a two-way edge. [Listing 2-6](#listing2-6) shows the code to do this
    and then plot the resulting hub and authority scores.

    Farrelly’s vertex V7 serving as a prominent hub in this network. Many of the medical
    school individuals point to V5 and V3, giving these vertices large authority scores,
    while V7 has a relatively modest authority score. This suggests that V3 and V5
    are the primary sources of information within this community, and they pass this
    information along to V7, who shares it with the rest of the medical school individuals;
    in contrast, there is not much of a centralized structure or efficient flow of
    information among the veterans group’s individuals.

    vertices connecting the network. However, the other centrality scores for V10
    are much more modest, suggesting it mainly functions as a bridge between communities
    rather than a true center of the network. This makes sense as V10 appears fairly
    undistinguished within the veterans group. It just happens to connect to Farrelly’s
    V7 and, hence, through her to the medical school community. Farrelly’s V7, on
    the other hand, has many neighbors (as indicated by degree) and is the top-ranked
    vertex for both hub score and PageRank—this is compatible with our conceptual
    understanding of this network as conveying two separate communities in which Farrelly
    is involved.

- en: While hub and authority centrality concern the potential flow of information
    through a directed network, another measure associated to the vertices in a weighted
    network concerns information in the sense of mathematical information theory.
    The *diversity* of a vertex is a scaled version of the Shannon entropy (a fractional
    measure of information content of a variable or set of variables) of the weight
    distribution of the edges attached to that vertex. As the name suggests, this
    captures the diversity of edge weights attached to each vertex. Entropy is maximal
    for a uniform distribution, so the diversity score is maximal (and scaled to 1)
    when all the edges have equal weights, and the diversity scores decrease from
    this value as the weights become more varied. One way to think about this is that
    a random walk on a weighted network (with probabilities proportional to the edge
    weights) will be least predictable at vertices with diversity scores closest to
    1 and more predictable for vertices with smaller diversity scores.

    The number that is used is 2 minus the sum of the degrees of the two vertices
    attached to the edge; this is the negated number of edges adjacent to the edge
    in question. For example, in Farrelly’s social network ([Figure 2-5](#figure2-5)),

    precisely the same information as the density and is perfectly correlated with
    it. Indeed, the average degree is the sum of all vertex degrees divided by the
    number of vertices, and the sum of all vertex degrees is always twice the number
    of edges. Thus, average degree and edge density differ by a constant that depends
    only on the number of vertices in the network. Consequently, you can use one or
    the other measure, but nothing is gained by using both simultaneously.

    closure) has a global counterpart. When setting the type parameter to `global`
    in igraph’s `transitivity()` function, a single number is computed that gives
    the fraction of triangles in the network that are closed. This gives another way,
    different from edge density, to measure the overall interconnectedness of a network.

    are more compact. For example, consider three friends—Amara, Imani, and Taraji—sharing
    news with each other at a lunch table. We’d expect the girls to exchange information
    more easily together at a table than they would if they were in separate classes
    texting each other or talking as they passed each other in the hallway. Let’s
    take a look at a few different ways to quantify the spread of a network.

    gives a global version of that metric that computes the average of the inverses
    of the network distances between all pairs of vertices in the network. No roadblocks
    are involved in this global variant of efficiency. Networks that are highly interconnected
    tend to have high global efficiency, as high interconnectivity means there are
    lots of direct routes between vertices, but, overall, it is best to think of global
    efficiency as a measure of the compactness of a network. The more spread out a
    network, the lower its global efficiency will be.

    of the vertices in the network (and, hence, the “longest shortest path” between
    two vertices). The *radius* of a network is the minimum eccentricity, which measures
    how far the center of the network is from the most distant part of the network.
    In igraph, you can use the `eccentricity()` function first to score all the vertices
    and then use standard R commands to extract the maximum and minimum values from
    them. Both diameter and radius quantify some aspect of the spread of the data.
    One structure that can produce a large difference between the diameter and radius
    is a structure where there are several loose hubs connected to each other through
    a single bridging individual.

- en: We have seen that eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix and other matrices closely
    related to it play an important role in multiple vertex centrality metrics; the
    spectral theory (eigenvalues and eigenvectors) of the adjacency matrix also provides
    us with some useful global metrics. The *spectral radius* of a network (which
    came up earlier in our discussion of Katz centrality) is the largest eigenvalue
    of the adjacency matrix. A variety of properties of the spectral radius have been
    established mathematically. In essence, the spectral radius measures propagation
    across the network. It is inversely related to the robustness of the network when
    considering the spread of a harmful entity across the network, such as fake news
    or a virus. For instance, in an epidemiological model that we’ll discuss in the
    next chapter, a smaller spectral radius means disease spreading across the network
    will die out more quickly.

    function in igraph that takes advantage of the sparse structure that adjacency
    matrices usually exhibit, or you can use any of the standard eigenvector or eigenvalue
    implementations in R, such as the `eigen()` function, on the network’s adjacency
    matrix.

    eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix, it is easy to use it to compute other spectral
    measures—such as the *spectral gap*, which is the difference between the largest
    eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix (the spectral radius) and the second largest
    eigenvalue. The spectral gap controls the convergence time of certain algorithms
    and random processes on the network, among other things. Other useful spectral
    measures are based on a variant of the adjacency matrix called the *graph Laplacian*,
    which is obtained by negating the adjacency matrix and adding the degree of each
    vertex to the corresponding diagonal matrix entry. The multiplicity of the 0 eigenvalue
    of the graph Laplacian is the number of connected components of the network. The
    smallest nonzero eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian is called the *algebraic connectivity*;
    this is a connectivity measure of the network that conveys how difficult it is
    to fragment the network into smaller pieces. Farrelly’s social network has a relatively
    low algebraic connectivity because removing a single vertex splits the network
    into the veterans group and the medical school group.

    is highly structured, then its edges should be very far from uniformly distributed,
    so the network will not look or behave like an Erdös–Renyi network. In the next
    two chapters, we’ll see how to practically implement this idea. Erdös–Renyi graphs
    do not appear often in nature, especially in socially driven settings. Real networks
    are almost always more structured than a network with purely random edges like

- en: A *scale-free graph* is a network whose degree distribution asymptotically follows
    a power law, meaning there is a constant, *c,* such that the fraction of vertices
    of degree 2*d* is 1/2^(*c*) times the fraction of vertices of degree *d* (at least
    approximately, with the approximation getting more accurate as *d* increases).
    The constant *c* (called the *power*) usually lies between 2 and 3\. This power
    law property leads to the existence of many vertices whose degree is much higher
    than the average vertex degree in the network. Consequently, scale-free networks
    usually have a spoke-and-wheel shape of loosely connected hubs, like airport terminals
    connecting at a central security gate. The hubs in the network tend to rein in
    the distances between vertices, giving these networks certain “small-world” properties.

    many more customers in the scale-free network than in the Watts–Strogatz network.
    This is why many planned real-world networks conform to a redundancy-heavy structure.
    The Watts–Strogatz networks do not exhibit strong hubs like scale-free networks,
    but they have a lot of structure not seen in the purely random Erdös–Renyi networks.

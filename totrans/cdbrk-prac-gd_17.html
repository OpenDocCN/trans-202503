<p class="BodyFirst"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_362" title="362"/>Congratulations! If you have read this book up to this point and understood the main concepts we’ve explained, you have learned a lot about codebreaking. You’re a considerable way along the path to becoming a skilled cryptanalyst. However, there is still a good deal more you can learn, and there are many more crypto challenges waiting to be solved. In the following sections, we will tell you how you can proceed on your codebreaking journey from here.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502727c17-0001"><a class="XrefDestination" id="Moreunsolvedcryptograms"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727c17-003"/>More unsolved cryptograms</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">In the first sixteen chapters of this book, we introduced dozens of unsolved cryptograms, such as the Voynich manuscript (<span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 5"><a href="c05.xhtml">Chapter 5</a></span>) and the Beale ciphers (<span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 6"><a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6</a></span>). Here are some more. Unlike the ones we have covered so far, these cryptograms cannot be assigned to a certain cipher type in an obvious way. After all, since they’re unsolved, we don’t even know how they were made!</p>
<h3 id="h2-502727c17-0001"><a class="XrefDestination" id="ThefourthKryptosmessage(K4)"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727c17-004"/>The fourth Kryptos message (K4)</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">The sculpture <em>Kryptos</em>, created in 1990 inside CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia, bears an encrypted inscription divided into four parts (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Appendix A">Appendix A</span> for details). While the first three parts have long been solved, number four (also known as K4) is still a mystery:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>                           OBKR</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>UOXOGHULBSOLIFBBWFLRVQQPRNGKSSO</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>TWTQSJQSSEKZZWATJKLUDIAWINFBNYP</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>VTTMZFPKWGDKZXTJCDIGKUHUAUEKCAR</code></p>
<p>Meanwhile, <em>Kryptos</em> creator Jim Sanborn has provided four different clues related to the K4 plaintext over the years. The first three were published in the <em>New York Times</em>, and the fourth was provided via email by the sculptor just shortly before the first edition of this book was published:</p>
<ol class="none">
<li>2010: The sixty-fourth through sixty-ninth positions of K4 are <code class="bold">BERLIN</code>.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c17-endnote-1" id="c17-noteref-1">1</a></sup></li>
<li>2014: The word <code class="bold">CLOCK</code> follows <code class="bold">BERLIN</code> in the K4 plaintext.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c17-endnote-2" id="c17-noteref-2">2</a></sup></li>

<li>August 2020: An additional word, <code class="bold">EAST</code>, appears at position 22.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following diagram shows K4 along with the four hints. Note that, just because the plaintext starts at a certain position, it does not necessarily mean that there is a one-to-one mapping with the ciphertext. For all we know, there may also be some transposition involved.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">On January 20, 1953, the body of eighteen-year-old student Paul Rubin was found in a ditch near Philadelphia International Airport. As it turned out, the cause of his death was cyanide poisoning. It is unclear whether Rubin committed suicide or was murdered, but as a chemistry student, he certainly had access to the kind of poison that killed him. When his corpse was found, Rubin had a small box attached to his abdomen that contained an encrypted message (see <a href="#figure17-1" id="figureanchor17-1">Figure 17-1</a>).</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">On June 30, 1999, police found a corpse in a cornfield near St. Louis, Missouri. After an investigation, they determined that he was a murder victim and identified him as forty-one-year-old Ricky McCormick. In one of his pockets, the investigators found two pieces of paper containing encrypted notes.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c17-endnote-5" id="c17-noteref-5">5</a></sup> The FBI engaged its codebreaking department, the CRRU, to uncover the plaintexts, but none of the specialists could solve the encryption, which is unusual, considering that the CRRU claims to have a high success rate. Members of the American Cryptogram Association who tried to break the encryption were also unsuccessful.</p>
<p>On March 30, 2011, the FBI took the extraordinary step of publishing McCormick’s two encrypted messages on the front page of the <a class="LinkURL" href="https://www.fbi.gov">https://www.fbi.gov</a> website, seeking the public’s help either in solving the cryptograms or identifying any other encrypted text that looked similar.

<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_366" title="366"/>Little is known for sure about the pigeon’s journey. The use of carrier pigeons was quite common in World War II, and the British Royal Air Force trained about 250,000 birds for this purpose. Typically, they dropped the pigeons into Nazi-occupied Europe, using parachutes. Agents picked them up and provided them to the British military for sending messages back home.</p>
<p>What we do know is that the pigeon that carried this message wore a ring indicating that it was banded in 1940. The message itself was carried in duplicate by two different pigeons. Each had a band from the National Union of Racing Pigeons (NURP):<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c17-endnote-7" id="c17-noteref-7">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="RunInPara"><span class="RunInHead">NURP 40 TW 194</span>  The “40” indicates that the pigeon was banded in 1940. “TW 194” probably means that it was pigeon #194 in Twickenham.</p>
<p class="RunInPara"><span class="RunInHead">NURP 37 DK 76</span>  This indicates that the pigeon was banded in 1937 and that its home was likely in Dorking.</p>
<p>The message is signed by a “Sergeant W. Stot,” which probably refers to Sergeant William Stott, age twenty-seven, who parachuted into Normandy on a reconnaissance mission. This dispatch was likely one of countless such messages transmitted around D-Day on June 6, 1944. The form said that its destination was X02, a codename for the Royal Air Force Bomber Command in High Wycombe.</p>
<p>Not much is known about which ciphers the British used at any particular time for encrypting their carrier pigeon traffic. It is therefore hard to say what kind of encryption was used for this message. Numerous codebreakers have tried to decipher it, without any luck. Some have suggested that the cipher used was a one-time pad (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 8"><a href="c08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a></span>), which would mean that the message will never be solved unless the key is found.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502727c17-0005"><a class="XrefDestination" id="NKRYPT"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727c17-008"/>The encrypted NKRYPT pillars</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst"><em>NKRYPT</em> is an art installation consisting of eight steel pillars located outside the Questacon Science and Technology Centre in Canberra, Australia (see <a href="#figure17-4" id="figureanchor17-4">Figure 17-4</a>). Installed in 2013, <em>NKRYPT</em> was designed by Stuart Kohlhagen, a science educator and the director of science and learning at Questacon.</p>
<p>Each of the <em>NKRYPT</em> pillars is covered with two laser-cut ciphertexts consisting of letters, numbers, and symbols. Around the base of each pillar, a string of numbers runs in a circular pattern, which some have suggested may represent DNA sequences. The cryptograms are all discrete but interlinked, and solving one may provide a clue to solving others.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c17-endnote-8" id="c17-noteref-8">8</a></sup> Additional challenges are located on and around the artwork, and the position and height of the columns have meanings, too.</p>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure17-4">Figure 17-4</a>: <em>NKRYPT</em> is an art installation located in Canberra, Australia. It displays a collection of encrypted messages, many of which are still unsolved.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to Kohlhagen, there are about sixty puzzles connected to <em>NKRYPT</em>. Some of them are hidden or only visible when others are solved, in a metapuzzle style. None of the cryptograms are based on modern crypto systems such as AES or RSA. The level of difficulty, at least of those that have been solved so far, varies considerably.</p>
<p>Two fan websites are dedicated to the sculpture: <em>NKRYPT</em> Sculpture by Melbourne-based computer scientist Glenn McIntosh<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c17-endnote-9" id="c17-noteref-9">9</a></sup> and DKRYPT by Greg Lloyd.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c17-endnote-10" id="c17-noteref-10">10</a></sup> As the pillars don’t have official names, we use Glenn’s labels of A through H. <a href="#figure17-5" id="figureanchor17-5">Figure 17-5</a> shows a blueprint of the artwork, which Stuart Kohlhagen provided to us. The sequence is the same in both, but reversed.</p>
<p>Of the sixteen obvious <em>NKRYPT</em> cryptograms, nine have been solved by Glenn McIntosh, Bob Dovenberg, and others. Most of these ciphertexts consist of lines of twenty-six characters. They were encrypted using a simple binary code, a Caesar cipher, a pigpen system, a rotor cipher, and a scytale. In many cases, Kohlhagen employed an additional route transposition via an irregular pattern (or, at least, a pattern that does not yet seem to have a definable rule). On pillar A, for instance, the route looks like this:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="175" src="image_fi/502727c17/g17002.png" width="568"/></figure>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_368" title="368"/><figure>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure17-5">Figure 17-5</a>: This blueprint by Kohlhagen shows the cryptograms on the eight <em>NKRYPT</em> pillars.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The plaintext begins at the top left-hand corner, <code class="bold">3527421491373 . . .</code> This sequence of numbers represents latitude and longitude coordinates for locations around Canberra, in the following format: S 35.2742, E 149.1373; then, S 35.2984, E 149.1312; etc. The transposition paths on the other pillars look similar but are not the same. Kohlhagen has told us that once all eight are completed, they form a part of the sculpture’s metapuzzle.</p>
<p>As a first example of an unsolved <em>NKRYPT</em> ciphertext, we’ll look at the upper message on pillar G (see <a href="#figure17-6" id="figureanchor17-6">Figure 17-6</a>). It consists of rounded figures with one angle (a symbol called a <em>squircle</em>), which form the aforementioned twenty-six-column pattern. Like all <em>NKRYPT</em> challenges, it doesn’t have an official name, so we will simply call it the squircle cryptogram.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_369" title="369"/><figure>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure17-6">Figure 17-6</a>: The squircle and PVL cryptograms are still unsolved.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The alphabet used in the squircle cryptogram consists of only four symbols, which McIntosh transcribes as <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code>. Here’s his transcript of the message:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>01110011011101021231331012</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>02030013322303333000200032</code></p>

<p class="BodyCustom"><code>30110333202120112302112123</code></p>
<p>The squircle cryptogram consists of 260 characters but too few distinct symbols or even digraphs to encode twenty-six letters. Therefore, our guess is that Kohlhagen used tetragraphs (i.e., groups of four characters). A single tetragraph, with a range of 0000 to 3333, could represent 256 possible numbers. This is an ideal amount for encoding ASCII characters, including upper and lowercase letters, numbers, punctuation symbols, and so forth. The ciphertext message on the pillar consists of sixty-five tetragraphs, meaning that (if we are right) it could potentially lead to a plaintext of sixty-five ASCII characters.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_370" title="370"/>Kohlhagen additionally pointed out to us that the cipher used for the squircle cryptogram includes a path transposition similar to the ones used for the other challenges. As all other known paths are based on a grid of single characters, independently of whether the cryptographic system uses digraphs or tetragraphs, one might have to form the tetragraphs after performing the transposition. Of course, the reverse could be true, as well!</p>
<p>Another unsolved <em>NKRYPT</em> ciphertext is depicted on pillar H. Again, each line consists of twenty-six characters, with ten lines in total and the letters <code>P</code>, <code>V</code>, and <code>L</code> written in a larger font. It has been called the PVL cryptogram. Here’s the transcript that McIntosh provides on his website:</p>

<p>Kohlhagen told us that the PVL cryptogram forms a final code, meaning one can only solve it if one knows the solution of some other puzzles.</p>
<p>As far as encrypted sculptures go, <em>NKRYPT</em> has received considerably less attention in the crypto community than the famous <em>Kryptos</em>. If you want to try your hand at breaking an unsolved cryptogram, cracking one of the unsolved <em>NKRYPT</em> ciphertexts might be the easier goal!</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">In our book, we have endeavored to introduce the most important techniques for breaking classical ciphers using both manual and computer-based methods. We believe our book is unique in that it is oriented toward the most frequent classical ciphers encountered in practice and introduces <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_372" title="372"/>many genuine solved and unsolved cryptograms. We are not aware of another book with a similar scope, but of course, there are many other fine codebreaking books on the market.</p>
<p>The following ones were written decades ago and are therefore computer agnostic:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Helen Fouché Gaines, <em>Cryptanalysis</em> (1939): This work is a classic and probably the most successful book about codebreaking ever written. Now outdated, as it was created before the computer age, it is still filled with valuable information for anyone interested in codebreaking techniques.</li>
<li>André Langie, <em>Cryptography</em> (1922): This is a great book that explains the ciphers and codebreaking methods of its time in an easy-to-understand way.</li>
<li>William Friedman, <em>Military Cryptanalysis, Parts I–IV</em> (ca. 1938): Friedman’s widely used work delivers a scientific approach to codebreaking in over a thousand pages. Considered the most famous cryptologist in history, Friedman is also the person who coined the terms “cryptanalysis” and “index of coincidence.”</li>
<li>Andreas Figl, <em>Systeme des Dechiffrierens</em> (<em>Systems of Decipherment</em>) (1927): Written by a World War I–era Austrian codebreaker in German, this book, along with its sister book, <em>Systeme des Chiffrierens </em>(1926), is outdated. However, in addition to Gaines’s <em>Cryptanalysis</em>, it is one of the best and most comprehensive codebreaking books of the pre-computer era.</li>
<li>US Department of the Army, <em>Basic Cryptanalysis</em> (1990): This field manual about breaking simple substitution ciphers, polyalphabetic ciphers, and transpositions is available for free on the internet.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c17-endnote-27" id="c17-noteref-27">27</a></sup></li>
<li>Solomon Kullback, <em>Statistical Methods in Cryptanalysis</em> (1976): This book focuses on codebreaking with statistics, such as frequency analysis and the index of coincidence.</li>
<li>Parker Hitt, <em>Manual for the Solution of Military Ciphers</em> (1916): This compact codebreaking work is published by the Press of the Army Service Schools. It covers simple substitution, polyalphabetic ciphers, transpositions, and Playfair.</li>
<li>Abraham Sinkov, <em>Elementary Cryptanalysis</em> (1966): This codebreaking book follows a mathematical approach.</li>
<li>William and Elizebeth Friedman, <em>The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined </em>(1957): In a lighthearted style, the famous codebreaking couple goes back to their roots to thoroughly debunk the idea that there were hidden messages in the works of Shakespeare.</li>
<li>Dermot Turing, <em>The Bombe: The Machine that Defeated Enigma</em> (2021): This book provides a very good description of the machine that was used by the British during World War II to break Enigma messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Codebreaking books that include computer-based techniques for solving historical ciphers are not as common:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_373" title="373"/>Robert Reynard, <em>Secret Code Breaker: A Cryptanalyst’s Handbook</em> (1996): This ninety-page book has a very basic introduction to cryptanalysis and mentions a number of computer programs from the time, though few of them are still relevant today.</li>
<li>George Lasry, “A Methodology for the Cryptanalysis of Classical Ciphers with Search Metaheuristics” (2018): This is George Lasry’s PhD thesis about breaking manual and machine ciphers with hill climbing and other methods.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c17-endnote-28" id="c17-noteref-28">28</a></sup></li>
<li>Al Sweigart, <em>Cracking Codes with Python</em> (2018): This work introduces many algorithms for implementing and breaking manual ciphers and also covers modern cryptography.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c17-endnote-29" id="c17-noteref-29">29</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there are many books that cover modern computer-based crypto algorithms, such as DES, AES, RSA, and Diffie-Hellman, but there are only a few that specialize in the cryptanalysis of those methods. <em>Applied Cryptanalysis: Breaking Ciphers in the Real World</em> (2007) by Mark Stamp and Richard M. Low and <em>Algorithmic Cryptanalysis</em> (2009) by Antoine Joux are good choices for anyone interested in cryptanalysis of modern systems.</p>
<p>Here are some other books that include information about codebreaking but do not focus on this topic:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>David Kahn, <em>The Codebreakers</em>, 2nd edition (1996): First published in 1967, this is the classic book about crypto history. As the title implies, it focuses more on the people who worked as codebreakers (and codemakers) than on codebreaking. Nevertheless, it is a must-read for everybody interested in cryptanalysis and the encryption methods of the last 4,000 years.</li>
<li>Bernhard Esslinger and CrypTool team, <em>Learning and Experiencing Cryptography with CrypTool and SageMath</em> (2018): This free book contains interesting information about classical encryption systems and how they can be broken with free software.</li>
<li>Craig Bauer, <em>Secret History: The Story of Cryptology</em>, 2nd edition (2021): This very interesting book combines the history of cryptology with mathematical descriptions of historical crypto algorithms. It is a good book for anyone who wishes to understand the mathematics of classical ciphers.</li>
<li>Craig Bauer, <em>Unsolved!</em> (2017): This well-researched book is about famous unsolved cryptograms; it includes a great deal of information about potential approaches to these interesting codebreaking mysteries.</li>
<li>Simon Singh, <em>The Code Book</em> (1999): This is a bestseller about the history of encryption. Some codebreaking techniques are explained.</li>
<li>Simon Singh, <em>The Cracking Code Book</em> (2002): Based on <em>The Code Book</em>, this work provides an entry-level introduction to codebreaking, mainly for children. Some editions are titled <em>The Code Book for Young People</em>.</li>
<li>Friedrich Bauer, <em>Decrypted Secrets</em> (2006): This classic was first published in 1997 and describes historical and modern encryption algorithms, along with cryptanalysis.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_374" title="374"/>Denise Sutherland and Mark Koltko-Rivera, <em>Cracking Codes &amp; Cryptograms for Dummies</em> (2011): Despite the promise of the title, only about 10% of this book is actually about codebreaking, but it still can be of interest because it has a large number of puzzles to solve.</li>
<li>A.J. Jacobs, <em>The Puzzler</em> (2022): Another bestseller, this was written by multiple-time TED speaker Jacobs in his entertaining point of view. He got in touch with experts (including us!), traveled to puzzle conventions, and even received an invitation from the CIA to see their encrypted <em>Kryptos</em> sculpture.</li>
<li>Liza Mundy, <em>The Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II</em> (2017): This is an absorbing work about the thousands of young women who helped with the war effort and then took the secrets of their codebreaking adventures to their grave. We are glad to finally see their stories properly told.</li>
<li>Benedek Láng, <em>Real Life Cryptology: Ciphers and Secrets in Early Modern Hungary</em> (2018): This book was published in both Hungarian and English, and the English version is available as a free download. It covers a variety of cipher types in medieval Europe in multiple languages.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c17-endnote-30" id="c17-noteref-30">30</a></sup></li>
<li>John F. Dooley, <em>History of Cryptography and Cryptanalysis: Codes, Ciphers, and Their Algorithms </em>(2018): This is a textbook about the history of cryptology, from ancient Greek and early Arabic writings up through a bit of modern computer-based cryptography. Though it doesn’t focus on computers, it includes more about modern encryption than other books of its kind.</li>
<li>Herbert O. Yardley, <em>The American Black Chamber</em> (1931): One of the most famous books on cryptology ever published, this text was quite controversial in its time because it described the inner workings of an American governmental cryptography organization. Critics said it might even have given Japan an edge during World War II. Primarily, it covers stories about codebreaking without much focus on cryptanalysis, though there is some good information on frequency analysis and the breaking of a German transposition cipher.</li>
<li>Tom Mahon and James J. Gillogly, <em>Decoding the IRA</em> (2008): This is an interesting read about Irish history in the 1920s, when the Irish Republican Army, a paramilitary organization, was fighting for independence from British rule and using ciphers in its communications. In the first chapter, Gillogly explains his deciphering methods.</li>
</ul>
<p>Last, but definitely not least, we are pleased to see that codebreaker Elizebeth Friedman (1892–1980) has been receiving some long-overdue attention. Over the last few years, a documentary and multiple books about her (for both adults and children) have been released. We especially recommend the following:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>Jason Fagone, <em>The Woman Who Smashed Codes</em> (2017): This is a well-researched and very readable biography/adventure story about Elizebeth’s life.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_375" title="375"/>G. Stuart Smith, <em>A Life in Code</em> (2017): This biography of Elizebeth Friedman was written by her great-nephew.</li>
<li>Amy Butler Greenfield, <em>The Woman All Spies Fear: Elizebeth Smith Friedman and Her Hidden Life</em> (2021): Written for grades 8 and up, this is a Kirkus Best Book of the Year and a very readable biography.</li>
<li>Laurie Wallmark (author) and Brooke Smart (illustrator), <em>Code Breaker, Spy Hunter: How Elizebeth Friedman Changed the Course of Two World Wars</em> (2021): This is an illustrated book about Elizebeth for young readers.</li>

    shown in our two-dimensional, spreadsheet-filled world. *The Shape of Data* walks
    you through this richer view and illustrates how to put it into practice.”

    application of geometry to the field of machine learning. It is expansive in scope
    and contains loads of concrete examples and coding tips for practical implementations,
    as well as extremely lucid, concise writing to unpack the concepts. Even as a
    more veteran data scientist who has been in the industry for years now, having
    read this book I’ve come away with a deeper connection to and new understanding
    of my field.”

    in data science. Topology and geometry advance the field of machine learning on
    unstructured data, and *The Shape of Data* does a great job introducing new readers
    to the subject.”

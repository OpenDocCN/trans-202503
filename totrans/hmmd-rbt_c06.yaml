- en: Buffer is very similar to Wobbler in many regards, but the main difference is
    its wheels. For this bot, you’ll attach two round “buffer” wheels to downward-facing
    motors that are rotating toward each other, so when you turn the bot on, it propels
    itself in the direction the scrubbers are spinning. Buffer looks a bit like a
    tiny street sweeper, but it moves differently from its larger cousin. However,
    it may actually clean your floor. Buffer is an easy little bot to build and fun
    to use.

- en: First, you’ll modify the servos, just like you did with Wobbler (see also Chapter
    4) or use one of the geared motor alternatives from Appendix A. Once this is completed,
    you’ll build the lint-brush buffer wheels. Then, you’ll attach the motors to the
    box lid and the buffing wheels to the motors, facedown toward the ground. Finally,
    you’ll wire together and power up the whole circuit.

    to attach the servo horn to the wheel itself. Cut the ruler into two 7-inch sections,
    which should be the diameter of the stainless-steel plumbing flange repair rings.![f06002](image_fi/500235c06/f06002.png)

    ruler sections to the repair ring and begin making Buffer’s wheels. First, position
    one ruler section across your repair ring, and with a marker pen, mark the ruler
    through the repair ring’s mounting holes at both ends of the ruler piece, as shown
    here. Try to get the mark as near to the center of the ruler’s width as possible.
    Repeat with the second section of the ruler.![f06003](image_fi/500235c06/f06003.png)

    the ruler. Mark the ruler through the other two holes you previously drilled into
    the servo horn. Do the same for the other ruler section.![f06007](image_fi/500235c06/f06007.png)

    of a repair ring so it forms a circle, zip-tying it in place as you go. Cut off
    excess zip-tie leads and any extra lint brush that remains. Repeat the process
    for the second lint brush and repair ring.![f06012](image_fi/500235c06/f06012.png)

    shorter edges of the lid. Try to get the marks in the center. Drill a ½-inch hole
    where you placed your two marks. If the plastic cracks or chips a little, it’s
    okay, so long as you can still zip-tie the motor in place.![f06013](image_fi/500235c06/f06013.png)

    the servo motor shaft into the center of one of the holes you just drilled. Make
    a mark on the lid over each of the four servo-mounting holes. Repeat this process
    for the other hole you drilled. Finally, drill holes through these eight marks
    using a 1/8-inch drill bit.![f06014](image_fi/500235c06/f06014.png)

    the servo horn and a hole in the ruler, then back up through one of the holes
    in the servo horn that sticks off the edge of the ruler, and then tie the zip
    tie. Repeat this process with the second zip tie, and make sure everything is
    firmly secured. Trim all excess zip-tie leads.![f06019](image_fi/500235c06/f06019.png)

    of the exposed solder joints can touch each other and short the bot. Alternatively,
    insulate the connections with shrink tube.![f06020](image_fi/500235c06/f06020.png)

<p class="CO">Sometimes it can be hard to explain to nontechnical staff that they, too, have a role to play in a cybersecurity incident. In this final chapter, we focus on exercises designed to engage specific groups within the business—namely, physical security, communications, and human resources.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">While these scenarios might also involve information technology and information security staff, we’ve designed them to show an organization that incident response involves more than just technical responders. An organization feels the real impact of a cybersecurity incident when it affects the business.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec1">&#13;
<h3 class="H1" id="sec1"><span id="h-152"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">A Physical Security Breach</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">It’s easy to forget that information security incidents can stem from security failings in the physical world. In fact, a threat actor who breaches the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_146" aria-label="146"/>physical security of a building can cause just as much damage, if not more, as an attacker compromising the information technology network from abroad.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">One of the benefits of exploring such a scenario is that it involves a team not typically included in an information security tabletop: physical security. Some organizations might not even have such a role, instead placing the responsibility of securing the property to risk management or another unrelated function.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">A physical security breach can certainly be far-fetched and resemble scenes from a <i>Mission: Impossible</i> movie (picture a threat actor crawling through heating and cooling air ducts). But even a simple attack can cause headaches, as in the example we outline here.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec2">&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec2"><span id="h-153"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">The Scenario</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">A threat actor gains access to a physical building by circumventing security controls. While in the building, they’re relatively unimpeded and have free rein to explore the facility. After some time, they leave with several items of value, including laptops, external storage devices (such as hard drives), and documents.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">In the exercise introduction, the threat actor is dressed in business casual clothing and enters the lobby of the corporate headquarters for MedCo, a medical insurance company. In order to proceed, the threat actor must present an access card to a radio-frequency identification (RFID) reader, which grants access and unlocks the door.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">At 8:30 <small>AM</small>, when foot traffic is greatest for employees arriving at MedCo to start their workday, the threat actor fumbles around in their backpack until a MedCo employee uses their card to enter, causing the RFID reader to beep and unlock the door. The threat actor smiles and gestures to indicate that they found their card, pulling a similarly colored access card out of their backpack. They pass it over the RFID reader (which does not beep) and grab the door as it is closing.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">The threat actor now has access to MedCo’s secure facility.</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Do MedCo employees undergo training on physical security access threats (such as tailgating, which occurred here)? If so, what are employees trained to do?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Would a security guard, camera, or other monitor have observed this inappropriate access?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Who is responsible for the physical security of the facility?</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec3">&#13;

<p class="TNI">Posing as an employee of MedCo, the threat actor sits at a desk meant for visiting remote employees. They pull out a laptop and plug the available network cable into their laptop, then attempt to connect to the network.</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Is there an authentication process that the laptop must undergo to connect to the organization’s network? What MedCo resources could the threat actor have reasonably accessed?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_147" aria-label="147"/>Would the information security team be alerted to the presence of an unknown information system connecting to the network? Would any other alerts be tripped?</li>&#13;

<p class="TNI">The threat actor walks up to an administrative assistant’s desk and states, “I’m with Phil &amp; Son’s HVAC Systems. We had an appointment to perform a maintenance check on the server room’s HVAC system. Can you let me in? Dave should know I’m coming.” The threat actor has a small bag of tools and appears, at first glance, to be an HVAC technician. Dave is MedCo’s IT manager, and his information is easy to find on LinkedIn.</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">What process does a contractor need to follow to request access to a system or room?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Is there a unique process for requesting access to sensitive rooms, such as the one containing servers?</li>&#13;

<p class="TNI">The administrative assistant asks the threat actor to take a seat while she wisely checks with information technology. The threat actor excuses themselves to use the restroom. Concerned that they may be discovered, they make their way to the exit.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Before leaving, the threat actor collects three laptops from unattended cubicles, places them in a backpack, and walks out the door.</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Assuming the employees discover that their laptops are missing when they return to their cubicles, is there a designated process in place for them to report the theft?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">In the past, have employees used this designated process?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Are there security cameras in the lobby, parking lot, working areas, or other locations? If so, how long is their footage retained?</li>&#13;

<li class="BL">How long would it take to determine the identifying information (such as serial numbers) of the stolen laptops? Would the organization be able to determine (a) if the device was encrypted and (b) what sensitive information was on the device?</li>&#13;

<p class="TNI">To adapt the scenario, consider making the following modifications:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">The threat actor is an ex-employee with intimate knowledge of how to navigate the facility.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">The threat actor steals data (contained on laptops or external hard drives) that is extremely sensitive and necessitates a significant response.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">The threat actor attains a more significant beachhead into the organization’s network.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">The threat actor poses as a member of the help desk team, pretends that there’s an issue at a workstation, and requests access to the employee’s system.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">The threat actor enters the facility after hours, pretending to be a member of the cleaning crew.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">The threat actor causes a disruption to the environment, either virtually or by physically tampering with network equipment.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">The threat actor installs a physical device in the environment, such as a rogue Wi-Fi access point mimicking a legitimate signal.</li>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec8"><span id="h-155"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">A Social Media Compromise</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Organizations use social media accounts to varying degrees. For some, these accounts are their primary mechanism for communicating with customers (and potentially employees). Social media also enables organizations to curate their brand image, which could take years to develop. The following scenario is most appropriate for these social media–forward companies.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Because a social media compromise is public facing from its initial moments, responding to it requires increased urgency. More importantly, it requires collaboration between teams that don’t typically work closely together, such as information security and the team that is responsible for social media (usually marketing). And, as you might discover, it isn’t uncommon for the marketing team to run its social media accounts without information security controls like multifactor authentication and password hygiene requirements.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2"><span id="sec9"/><span id="h-156"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">The Scenario</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">In this scenario, a threat actor posts to the organization’s social media accounts. Though simple, this exercise can quickly generate discussion about a myriad of pressing concerns and an incident bubbling into the public domain. Because the organization has lost control of the account and can’t log in, staff must quickly determine how to (a) regain control of the accounts and (b) communicate with a public concerned about the content of the posts.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Begin at 3 <small>AM</small> on Saturday morning, when Happy Bear Childcare Centers, a regional childcare facility with over 150 locations in Canada and almost 4,000 full- and part-time employees, finds that its social media feeds have been populated with propaganda from the Levant Liberation Army.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">The propaganda includes derogatory messages about various parties, along with several other offensive statements. The messages contrast starkly with Happy Bear Childcare Centers’ previous social media messages promoting their business.</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">At 3 <small>AM</small> on the weekend, is any member of Happy Bear’s staff monitoring the social media platforms?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Has Happy Bear hired a social media brand reputation company, which may have seen the messages from the Levant Liberation Army? If so, what is the process for alerting staff?</li>&#13;

<p class="TNI">Most organizations make security investments focused on keeping themselves safe from external threat actors, but insider threats are an equally consequential possibility that tabletop exercises should explore.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Insider threats take many forms: lackadaisical employees failing to take security seriously, employees determined to cause harm to their employer, or staff who want to profit from the sale of intellectual property, to name a few.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">If you’ve engaged an outside consultant for an insider threat scenario, it’s especially important to leverage a trusted agent from the organization to help you craft a realistic scenario. Most insider threats occur when employees abuse their previously granted privileges, and a trusted agent is more likely than the facilitator to understand these potential control breakdowns.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">During the scenario, be sure to contemplate both technical and nontechnical threats. The internet is filled with stories about sensitive data being lost simply because someone stole printouts or took pictures of data with a cell phone camera.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Finally, while the scenario will likely involve technical controls, various policies and procedures might also come into play, requiring legal or other teams to get involved.</p>&#13;

Many businesses face the following scenario: <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_153" aria-label="153"/>an insider steals key intellectual property with the intention of opening a competing business.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Begin the scenario when David, a longtime account manager at Mica’s Fleet Repair, finishes a meeting with one of Mica’s original clients, Central Delivery Services. Central had recently decided to end its relationship with Mica’s. When asked why, Central responded that it was happy with Mica’s services, but it had received a quote that was 10 percent cheaper from NYFleet, a new upstart formed by a former Mica employee, Ajay.</p>&#13;

They would like to preserve any of Ajay’s information in case it becomes relevant for investigatory purposes and potential litigation.</p>&#13;

<p class="TNI">A former colleague of Ajay’s, Martin, approaches his manager after hearing rumors that Ajay is being investigated. Martin tells his manager that Ajay once bragged about how easy it would be to email client information to himself and start his own competing business. It has been four months since Ajay’s departure.</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">How long does Mica’s maintain email accounts following an employee’s departure? Is there a retention or destruction policy?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">After four months, what remaining investigatory artifacts could help verify whether Ajay emailed himself the documents?</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;

<p class="TNI">As the investigation unfolds, it becomes clear that a number of policy and technology breakdowns would have enabled Ajay to steal intellectual property. Executive management wants to make changes so this does not happen again.</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Given that the breakdown occurred across teams, should a certain role take the lead in addressing it? If so, who? Perhaps audit or risk management?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">How will Mica’s validate that the identified gaps have been corrected? Who, specifically, can determine that the implemented solutions are adequate?</li>&#13;

<h4 class="H2"><span id="sec26"/><span id="h-160"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Possible Modifications</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">To adapt the scenario, consider making the following modifications:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">The vector used to steal sensitive information includes printing documents, using a cell phone camera, or downloading files to a USB drive.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">The sensitive information is relevant to the organization conducting the exercise. For example, it may include chemical formulas, prototype drawings, or research data.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Instead of losing client information, the insider stole regulated data (such as health information) or information that necessitates notifying other businesses.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">The insider is a current employee, and their role makes them highly knowledgeable about information technology processes. This means they are capable of covering their tracks by deleting logs. (Also, if the departure of such an employee would cause significant hardships, discuss during the exercise the possibility of making some employee tasks redundant to ensure that power and knowledge don’t reside solely with one person.)</li>&#13;

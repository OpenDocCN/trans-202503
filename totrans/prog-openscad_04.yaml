    not harder. First, you’ll learn to use a very useful programming tool called a
    *loop*. Loops let you draw many similar shapes with only a few lines of code.

- en: This is particularly useful when your designs have repeated features. For instance,
    if you’re creating a model of the Empire State Building, typing one individual
    statement for each window in the building would consume a lot of time. With a
    loop, you can repeat a single window along a fixed pattern so OpenSCAD can take
    care of the tedious work of copying and pasting the same window many times. You’ll
    also learn how to use variables to keep track of important data related to your
    designs. Because these new OpenSCAD tools will allow you to create more complicated
    designs, you’ll also learn how to use comments to leave notes for yourself and
    other collaborators on your design.

    designs. *Comments* provide a way for you to leave notes to yourself and others
    who might read your code. OpenSCAD ignores comment statements, as they are meant
    only as notes for the humans who read them rather than as instructions for OpenSCAD
    to draw a particular shape.

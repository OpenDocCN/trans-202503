- en: First of all, thank you to my wife, Philly, and our kids, Lyra and Hazel, for
    making this all worth it. I’m sorry so many of my evenings have been taken up
    with writing, and I promise I won’t write another book for at least a year!

    my editor Nathan Heidelberger for your excellent work in shaping my text (and
    for putting up with my many delays!), and to everyone else at No Starch for your
    work in turning this book into reality.

    me to Twitter and later referred me to Bill Pollock—I wouldn’t be here writing
    this if it weren’t for him.

    from users when your Arduino isn’t connected to a device with a keyboard. For
    example, you might like the ability to turn something on or off by entering a
    secret number. One option would be to wire up 10 or more push buttons to various
    digital input pins (for the numbers 0 through 9), but it’s much easier to use
    a numeric keypad like the one shown in [Figure 11-1](#figure11-1).

- en: One of the benefits of using a keypad is that it uses only 8 pins for 16 active
    buttons, and with the use of a clever Arduino library, you won’t need to add pull-down
    resistors for debouncing as we did in Chapter 4.

- en: 'When you need to compare two or more variables against another value, you’ll
    often find it easier and neater to use a `switch case` statement instead of an
    `if then` statement, because `switch case` statements can make an indefinite number
    of comparisons and run code when the comparison returns true. For example, if
    we had the integer variable `xx` with a possible value of `1`, `2`, or `3` and
    we wanted to run different code based on whether the value was `1`, `2`, or `3`,
    we could use code like the following to replace our `if then` statement:'

- en: In this project, we’ll start to create a keypad-controlled lock. We’ll use the
    basic setup described in the sketch in [Listing 11-1](#listing11-1), but we’ll
    also include a six-digit secret code that a user needs to enter on the keypad.
    The Serial Monitor will tell the user whether the code they’ve input is correct
    or not.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The secret code is stored in the sketch but is not displayed to the user. The
    sketch will call different functions depending on whether the input code (PIN)
    is correct. To activate and deactivate the lock, the user must press `*` and then
    the secret number, followed by `#`.

- en: After the usual setup routines (as described in [Listing 11-1](#listing11-1)),
    the sketch continually “listens” to the keypad by running the function `readKeypad()`
    at 6. After a key is pressed, the Arduino examines the value of the key using
    a `switch case` statement at 5. The Arduino stores the values of the keys pressed
    on the keypad in the array `attempt`, and when the user presses `#`, the Arduino
    calls the function `checkPIN()`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At 2, the Arduino compares the values of the pressed keys against the PIN stored
    in the array `PIN` at 1. If the correct sequence is entered, the function `correctPIN()`
    at 3 is called, where you can add your own code to execute. If an incorrect sequence
    is entered, the function `incorrectPIN()` at 4 is called. Finally, once the user’s
    entry has been checked, the code deletes the entry from memory so the code is
    ready for the next test.

    press star (`*`) on the numeric keypad, type the secret number, and then enter
    the pound sign (`#`). Try entering both correct and incorrect numbers. Your results
    should be similar to the output shown in [Figure 11-4](#figure11-4).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This example serves as a perfect foundation for your own PIN-activated devices,
    such as locks, alarms, or anything else you can imagine. Just be sure to replace
    the code in `correctPIN()` and `incorrectPIN()` with the code you want to run
    when a correct or incorrect sequence is entered.

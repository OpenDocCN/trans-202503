<h1 class="ChapterTitle"><a id="_idTextAnchor123"/>Networking a Coding Community</h1>&#13;
</header>&#13;
<p class="ChapterIntroFirst">To further ensure the success of your learners, in this chapter we’ll explore community building efforts you can promote at your school to encourage a safe, supportive, and engaging learning environment. Research indicates that students who feel connected to their school community are more likely to exhibit altruistic behaviors, be more academically driven, and develop improved social-emotional skills. The activities and programs covered here are intended to foster a sense of belonging and accomplishment for your students. They’ll also involve constructing a support system that will hopefully extend beyond the school walls and into the local community.</p>&#13;
<h2 class="HeadA"><a id="_idTextAnchor124"/>Your Computer Science Community</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Your community is a network of personal relationships and connections. As a computer science educator, you know the power of large networks. <em class="EmphasisItalic">Metcalfe’s</em><em class="EmphasisItalic"> law</em> states that the number of possible unique connections in a network grows proportional to the square of the number of users connected to it. The maximum number of unique connections, is equal to <em class="EmphasisItalic">n</em>(<em class="EmphasisItalic">n</em>-1)/2, where <em class="EmphasisItalic">n</em> is the number of nodes on the network. Similarly, the more people in a group, the more ways the people in that group can form relationships and collaborate. A classroom of 20 students can form 190 possible relationship connections, and a computer science program of 100 students can form 4,950. But you, as the educator, must provide the environment in which these relationships can grow.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="HeadB"><a id="_idTextAnchor125"/>Classroom Meetings</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">One popular way to begin building a sense of community with your classroom is to hold regular <em class="EmphasisItalic">classroom meetings</em>. This is a set time when you encourage students to compliment one another, discuss what is and isn’t working in the class, share class-related anecdotes from their home life, or help one another with homework. </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">This is also a time to help students build a sense of ownership of their education. To do so, you should think about curriculum areas where you can empower student voice and choice. Classroom coding exercises are one such area. In Chapter 7, we walked through several coding exercises and examined how to address multiple computer science standards in each one. As an educator, over the years, you’ll curate a collection of class exercises. In your class meetings, offer students some options and let them debate and choose an activity based on their collective interests.</p>&#13;

<h2 class="BoxHead">Robert’s Rules of Order</h2>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Classroom meetings empower many students to show leadership and take responsibility for their learning, like meetings in the real world. But students can also fall prey to overpowering personalities speaking over more introverted students. To prevent this problem, many organizations adopt <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">Robert’s Rules of Order</em>, which are parliamentary procedures for conducting meetings in a fair, respectful manner.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">From a computer science perspective, Robert’s Rules are like an algorithm for conducting meetings in such a way that everyone gets equal time to share their voice. There are procedures for raising issues, putting them aside, and recognizing speakers. When debating an issue, each participant can speak twice on the topic, but must wait for all participants to have the opportunity to speak a first time before they can speak a second time. This way, everyone feels secure in knowing the algorithm, when properly followed, will allow them the opportunity to be heard.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">When speaking, participants preface their comments with specific terminology that demonstrates they’re obeying the procedural rules. For example, to interrupt a speaker without being impolite, a student might state “Point of privilege . . .” and ask the speaker to raise their voice so everyone can hear or ask for others in the room for silence. They might say “I move that . . .” to introduce a subject for discussion, or they might state “Point of order . . .” to object when they feel a procedure isn’t being properly followed. In a way, these statements are like function calls in programming to formally direct the discussion.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">An important part of Robert’s Rules is the respectful mind-set they encourage in participants. Here are some important principles they include:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li class="BoxBulletListA">Listen to the other side.</li>&#13;
<li class="BoxBulletListB">Focus on issues, not personalities.</li>&#13;
<li class="BoxBulletListB">Avoid questioning motives.</li>&#13;
<li class="BoxBulletListC">Be polite. </li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyLast">Robert’s Rules emphasize the importance of separating ourselves from our ideas so we don’t take criticism of our ideas as personal criticism. Incorporating these rules into your classroom meetings immerses your students in this popular parliamentary algorithm so they can absorb the experience and use it in leadership roles in other organizations.</p>&#13;
<div class="bottom hr"><hr/></div>&#13;
</section>&#13;
</aside>&#13;
<p class="Body">In addition to letting your students discuss and choose some of their classroom activities, you can allow them to choose a <em class="EmphasisItalic">programming style</em> or <em class="EmphasisItalic">code style</em> the class will use to write code. For example, what’s the maximum number of characters per line of code before breaking to a second line? Will you use <em class="EmphasisItalic">camel case</em> for variables names, capitalizing each word after the first, like <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">camelCase</span>, or will you use <em class="EmphasisItalic">snake case</em> and separate words with underscores, like <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">snake_case</span>?</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">How many spaces will you indent your nested code? For curly braces, will you keep the open brace on the same line as your function or conditional statement, as in Listing 10-1?</p>&#13;
<pre>if( a == b ) {&#13;
   . . .&#13;
}</pre>&#13;
<p class="Listing">Listing 10-1: Open brace on the same line</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Or will you line up the open braces, as in Listing 10-2?</p>&#13;
<pre>if( a == b )&#13;
{&#13;
   . . .&#13;
}</pre>&#13;
<p class="Listing">Listing 10-2: Open braces lined up with one another</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Listing 10-1 and Listing 10-2 are common and legitimate coding styles. Students might become surprisingly passionate about these details, just like programmers in the professional world are. The great aspect of these choices is that they’re low stakes if you lay out the options and allow for modifying the standards at a later point. Including students in the process of defining standards like these gives them a sense of ownership, responsibility, and academic motivation.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="HeadB"><a id="_idTextAnchor126"/>Pair Programming</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">In addition to classroom meetings, another common strategy for building student connections is a <em class="EmphasisItalic">buddy program</em>. Traditionally, this is where an older student is paired with a younger student of at least two grade levels’ difference. The younger student benefits from the mentoring and one-on-one time spent with the older student; the older student benefits from taking a leadership role and the responsibility that comes with it. Both students benefit from the cooperative nature of the relationship as it relates to their academic lives.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Analogous to the buddy program in schools is the Agile methodology technique of <em class="EmphasisItalic">pair programming</em>, where two developers work together on one computer. In this exercise, one developer works at the keyboard writing the code and the other reviews the code as it’s written. The two switch places regularly, alternating between writing code and reviewing it.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">The relationship and benefits of this technique can depend on the skill levels of the two programmers. If one programmer has more experience, they’ll take a mentoring role to the less experienced member. It’s very important in such a pairing that the more experienced programmer not drive the development, putting the less experienced programmer into a more passive role. If the two programmers are equally proficient, they’ll both benefit from the differing backgrounds and experience they bring to the exercise. In all pairings, the programmers will benefit from increased productivity because they must remain focused out of respect for their peer, and increased quality because two sets of eyes review every line of code committed during the exercise. Students will also practice their technical communication and collaboration skills when using this technique.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Several studies on pair programming have found significant benefits for girls specifically. One study found that girls who took part in pair programming exercises in a computer science class performed significantly better on the final exam. Another study found that the practice helped to close the gender gap and encourage more girls to take computer science as a major later on. Pair programming can help break the perception of computer science as a solitary and isolating discipline by promoting socialization and collaboration among students.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Extending the pair programming technique is <em class="EmphasisItalic">mob programming</em>, where a team or your class collaborates on writing software on a single computer. This exercise might be useful when introducing new concepts or as a fun way to engage the class. But with many participants, the exercise can become less personalized and difficult to manage.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="HeadB"><a id="_idTextAnchor127"/>Online Forums</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">In the previous chapter, we reviewed online forums as a place where students can seek help and find answers to their tough programming conundrums. Online forums can also provide opportunities for your students to engage in <em class="EmphasisItalic">asynchronous communication</em>, where the conversation doesn’t occur in real time. This allows students time to think about what they want to post and properly articulate their thoughts. Online forums are a great way to bring more introverted students into the conversation, because they aren’t put on the spot in face-to-face activities.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">One option for your classroom forum is to set up a members-only discussion board, so only students in your classes can participate. The problem with forums restricted to just your students is that they’ll naturally suffer from low participation. To be successful, forums need a critical mass of members to produce, read, and respond to content. To overcome any lack of participation, you can mandate that students post regularly and engage with their classmates in the forum.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Another option is to engage with an existing public forum like Stack Overflow. These communities are successful because they maintain productive discourse using <em class="EmphasisItalic">reputation scores</em>, where users award substantively helpful posts and comments with upvotes. These upvotes translate into points for the poster who can earn badges and level up to earn more site privileges. In this way, the platform gamifies constructive c­ommunity participation.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">One way to engage with this platform is to sort students into teams, with each group having a team account on the forum using a name that preserves student anonymity. Teams then earn points for submitting questions, submitting advice on improving the wording of questions, or answering questions posed by other users. See which teams earn the highest reputation scores. As we’ll see in the “Professional Development Services” section, these scores can have real-world benefits when students are looking for employment.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Another important aspect of building an inclusive computer science community at your school is in how that community interacts with the larger schoolwide population. One of the greatest aspects of computer science is that so many examples of it are already at work in your school. In the next section, we’ll look at outreach strategies that will increase visibility for your computer science program while providing services to your school.</p>&#13;
<h2 class="HeadA"><a id="_idTextAnchor128"/>Your Schoolwide Community</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">So far, we’ve covered some strategies to build bonds between the students in your classrooms and the computer science department. An important aspect of your computer science community’s identity is how it fits into and contributes to the larger academic community. Here we’ll cover some ways your computer science program and your students can make meaningful contributions to your school while getting hands-on experiences. Those experiences will provide them with a deeper understanding of computer science standards involving hardware, software, and computer systems, and how users interact with these systems. </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">We’ll examine three documents you should maintain at your school as a best practice: your Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), current state assessment, and technology strategic plan. These documents will define how users are allowed to access your infrastructure, catalog your existing systems, and articulate a vision for how you and your students want IT to serve your school’s mission in the future. Each document is a computational artifact, and constructing or revising each document involves collaboration, research, and deep inquiry. By including your students in a document’s revisions, you’re connecting computer science standards to the concrete ways they apply to your school. Students who help with the revision process will have deeper insights into the school’s computer systems as they work with them throughout the school year.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="HeadB"><a id="_idTextAnchor129"/>Student Privacy Is Paramount</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Before discussing your school’s IT infrastructure and the systems where your students can assist, we need to note those systems your students can’t access. The United States <em class="EmphasisItalic">Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)</em> prohibits schools from releasing any academic information about a student without parental permission or permission of the student if they are of legal age. Third-party software providers can work with student academic data if they’re providing services to the school and a school official has authorized access to the data.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Software providers working with student <em class="EmphasisItalic">Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</em>, data they can use to link a student to education records, must satisfy several requirements to ensure that data’s security. These requirements include transparency as to what student data is collected and how it will be used, and notifying parents of its use to allow them to opt out. The provider must have a security plan and a policy for handling a potential data breach. They must also have a process for certifying data destruction when the services are complete.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Although students at your school can’t work on these systems, it can be enlightening for them to learn about FERPA and its implications for your school’s IT infrastructure. These kinds of legal insights help inform discussions when defining what is allowable on school computer systems.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="HeadB"><a id="_idTextAnchor130"/>Acceptable Use Policy</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">When a school provides computers, internet access, and web applications to students, it’s a best practice to have those users sign or accept an AUP. This document defines what behaviors are prohibited on school resources to protect the school, its equipment, and the students from harm. It prevents destructive behaviors and protects student identities.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">The US Department of Education recommends including students in the process when revising your school’s AUP to encourage a sense of ownership of the document and buy-in for it. The AUP should be student centered and student friendly, and explain the reasons for its policies rather than just what is prohibited.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">For example, not allowing food and drink near school computers is an example of a prohibited behavior that protects the school’s technology from spills. You and your students might agree to prohibit students from accessing personal accounts, such as email or social networking, on public computers. The sites students visit might be stored in the browser’s history, allowing other users to see the sites they’ve visited, including web searches. Imagine one student using a school computer to search on a private medical issue and then another seeing that search in the browser history. If a site stores cookies to avoid having to enter a username and password with each visit, other users on the same computer might be able to access the student’s account. Explaining to students how these policies protect them not only encourages adherence, but also educates students on how to protect themselves outside the classroom.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Enforcing the AUP is another area in which to include your students. Policies like maintaining computer access logs, using site filtering software, and mandating a teacher be present when computers are in use can ensure policies are being followed.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Students in your computer science program can learn a lot from helping to revise the AUP, and you can also enlist them in publicizing it. You could create a project in which students use multimedia to promote and explain the AUP to their peers. Your students could also visit other classrooms, give presentations, and answer questions to help get the word out.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="HeadB"><a id="_idTextAnchor131"/>School IT Infrastructure</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">To best inform your computer science students and their understanding of the AUP, you can familiarize them with your school’s existing IT infrastructure. Although your students are prohibited from working with systems that handle student academic data, most likely many other systems are available for students to learn about, such as computer labs and Wi-Fi, which are used in classroom instruction. Learning the details of these systems will give students a sense of ownership and responsibility for them.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Providing your students with the opportunity for hands-on experience with your school’s IT infrastructure provides a meaningful way to cover several computer science standards relevant to hardware, software, and troubleshooting. As you talk with your students about your school’s hardware and software, make sure they’re using appropriate terminology when identifying components. Highlight when hardware upgrades improve software performance so they can better understand how hardware and software relate to one another. Illustrate how these many components within each computer interact and depend on each other to form a system. </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">This is also an opportunity for students who don’t have access to computers at home to play with hardware that they might not otherwise have access to and to experience processes common in the professional world. For example, you could have a lab or workshop where you lead the class through the process of upgrading hardware or software components on a group of computers.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Start by familiarizing your students with the systems they access at school. What are the various hardware specifications for the computers they use? What is the central processing unit (CPU) operating frequency? How much RAM do systems have installed? For storage, do they use hard disk drives (HDD), solid state drives (SSD), or a hybrid of the two? What is the storage capacity? Which internet service provider (ISP) does the school use? What is the connection’s bandwidth?</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">On the software side, have them determine which operating systems the school uses. What software is installed for productivity? Which versions of this software are installed, and how are they maintained? How are upgrades deployed? Does the school’s IT staff use <em class="EmphasisItalic">disk imaging software</em>, which allows engineers to make a copy of all the software and configurations on one computer to deploy on other systems with the same hardware?</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">In addition to your school’s supported infrastructure, the school might also use <em class="EmphasisItalic">shadow IT</em>, which is tech used at your school for productivity or on the network that isn’t officially supported. This could include apps teachers use to manage their classrooms or apps students use to connect to the Wi-Fi on their smartphones. It can also include documenting how people are using the software provided or if they’re quietly forgoing it because the applications fail to meet their needs. Your students will derive novel insights when they compare their expectations of how users are supposed to interact with technology to how it’s actually being used at your school.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Work with your students to compile all these findings into a <em class="EmphasisItalic">current state assessment</em> report. Such inventories are essential in the professional world, and your school is no exception. By creating this report, your students will gain firsthand experience with computer science facets related to hardware, software, and how people use information technology. Once the infrastructure is cataloged, students can begin reviewing and revising potential future states for IT at your school.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="HeadB"><a id="_idTextAnchor132"/>Technology Strategic Plan</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Once your students understand your school’s current technological state, you can begin thinking about its future state. A <em class="EmphasisItalic">technology strategic plan</em> is a living document that clearly defines your school’s vision for how technology will contribute to your organization’s mission. It outlines goals for supporting the mission and implementation strategies for achieving those goals at a high level. You should revise the strategic plan annually. The yearly revision presents a great opportunity to include students in the process as a learning activity and to gather their insights as community members.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Before revising the strategic plan, have your students explore what plans related to your organization already exist. Are there strategic plans at the district, county, or state levels? What about plans for other schools? What aspects of these plans do your students like or dislike? Seeing the various ways local organizations approach this document should give students an appreciation for how your local institutions enhance their IT infrastructure to meet their educational goals.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Because your technology program services your school, your strategic plan should tie into your school’s mission statement and tie your technology vision into serving that. How is your technology tied to learning outcomes at your school? How does your technology build community bonds and foster collaboration? You might want to address certain attributes, such as accessibility, productivity, problem solving, and technological literacy. Many computer science concepts related to digital citizenship, such as inclusiveness, equity, regulations, ethics, and safety, are important in the plan. Having your students wrestle with and discuss these many dimensions of IT as they relate to your school and themselves helps them practically apply these concepts.</p>&#13;
<aside epub:type="sidebar">&#13;
<div class="top hr"><hr/></div>&#13;
<section class="feature1">&#13;
<h2 class="BoxHead">A School Code Repository</h2>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Tradition is an effective force for strengthening student connections at your school. Many schools have a tradition where art students paint a mural for the school year on a wall in the cafeteria or other public space. Like yearbooks and literary magazines, murals from previous classes are like windows that connect students to the lives of the school’s alumni.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">You can set up an additional tradition with your computer science classes by using a <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">code repository</em>. A repository is an online site where your students save and manage their code projects. Repositories are indispensable for how they keep track of changes and store snapshots of different versions of code bases using <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">version management</em>. They also allow for collaboration by empowering multiple students to work on the same code simultaneously to later merge their changes into a single product.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">Repositories are also invaluable because they let users share code. A feature-rich repository provides tools for students to search through the applications, select one, and <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">fork</em> or <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">clone </em>it—that is, make a copy of the code—and then enhance it along a new development branch. Repositories that contain code from alumni can provide current students with a fruitful resource to learn from and extend.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyLast">As each year’s students build a library of applications through projects and events, you can store them in your school code repository for future students. Each set of projects becomes another mural connecting the alumni to the new generation of students. This thread of school history serves two practical purposes: it provides sample code from which to learn and the common cultural connections on which to build tradition.</p>&#13;
<div class="bottom hr"><hr/></div>&#13;
</section>&#13;
</aside><p class="Body">Once your vision is collaboratively defined, you’ll craft a road map for IT at your school that lays out future software and hardware upgrades into a general timeline of projects. Your students should enjoy being in the know about future efforts and take pride in being part of the decision-making process. Sharing this road map with your users provides enhancements they can look forward to and gives you a reason to promote your computer science program as they’re accomplished.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="HeadB"><a id="_idTextAnchor133"/>Metrics</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">One challenge for your IT cataloging efforts will be learning how satisfied your users are with the technology at your school. For this reason, regular user satisfaction surveys are a great tool for keeping a finger on the pulse of how happy your users are with your tech and providing your students with deeper insights into how people interact with technology. These are brief, anonymous questionnaires sent out at regular monthly or quarterly intervals. They ask your users to rate their satisfaction with areas of the IT infrastructure on a scale. </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">A sample question might be “How satisfied are you on a scale of 1 to 10 with the school website: 1 is very unsatisfied and 10 is very satisfied?” These surveys will help you initially identify problem areas in your infrastructure. Then, as you make improvements to the service, you can see how the responses change over time.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">For services like the school website or software applications, another technique is to sit down with users and have them walk you through how they use the product. The people who use your school’s information systems the most will develop tricks and shortcuts to increase their productivity. Often, you’ll find ways to improve these applications with new features that will help your power users.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">An important question for your strategic plan is “How do you define success?” A measure of success could include an increase in positive responses on surveys. From a technical standpoint, a measure of success could be an increase in system performance or internet speeds. Setting specific, quantifiable, and reasonable goals will give your students a sense of achievement as you meet them.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Most important, celebrate your victories. When you successfully run an upgrade on your systems or migrate to software that better meets your users’ needs, take the time to publicize this fact and celebrate with your students. As we’ll see in the next section, they can also bring these achievements home to celebrate with their families.</p>&#13;
<h2 class="HeadA"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/>Your Local Community</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">An important part of building a supportive, interconnected school community is connecting with your students’ local communities. Throughout this book, we’ve focused on activities and technologies many of your students can continue to work with when they leave the school grounds. Chapters 5 and 6 described a development environment your students can find on any computer, so they can continue experimenting with and exploring code on their own or show off to their families.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Find ways to tie additional learning for your students between home and school. Chapter 3 covered the history of computer science, learning how advancements built on top of one another. Have your students ask their older relatives about the information technologies they had while growing up. Maybe they worked with green-screen computers, floppy disks, rotary telephones, slide rulers, card catalogs, or some of the technologies that now only exist as icons on our smartphones. What stories of antiquated tech will your students bring to your classroom meetings?</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Chapter 8 reviewed PBL as a tool for deeply engaging your students in research and sustained inquiry. At the end of the development process was the deployment phase, a public event where students presented their projects. Such events provide another opportunity to build community connections between home and school. </p>&#13;
<h3 class="HeadB"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>Host a Hackathon or Code Camp</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">One event that can connect a student’s home life with their school life is a <em class="EmphasisItalic">hackathon</em>. Most often, this is an intense 24-hour coding marathon where students or teams of students produce a start-to-finish application. The experience breaks students out of the school routine, puts them into a strongly focused mind-set, and builds camaraderie among peers as they weather fatigue and rise to challenges to make the deadline.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Best held on weekends to allow students time to catch up on sleep, hackathons culminate with a final presentation session. During the session, projects in various states of completion are presented to judges who evaluate the projects on a variety of pre-established criteria. Parents and mentors are welcomed into the process to provide emotional and technical support. In this sense, the hackathon becomes a condensed PBL experience.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Like a hackathon but less intense is the option to host a <em class="EmphasisItalic">code camp</em>. This would be a one- to two-week-long program hosted over the summer break, where students work on a project from start to finish. Whereas a hackathon is best geared toward middle and high school students, a code camp is a great experience for elementary school students as well. By taking place during the summer, code camps can help mitigate some of the dreaded “brain drain” that can happen to students when they’re out of school for a prolonged period of time.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">An important aspect of your hackathon or code camp is its theme. Many hackathons in the professional world have charities, and nonprofits send subject matter experts (SMEs) from the organization to bring application requests to the event. Programmers then review the various requests and donate their time to those where they think they can best contribute. You could set up a similar format for your events. Earlier in the book, we talked about having your school’s teachers send out requests for explorable explanations. Have your school faculty bring application requests to the event and act as the SME for students willing to take on the project.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Similarly, you could involve your local business community in the event. Perhaps some local businesses or nonprofits could use custom information system solutions. Many companies will donate money or promotional materials (“swag”) to your event, which you can pass along to students to keep up their spirits.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="HeadB"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"/>Professional Development Services</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Building bonds with your local businesses through event sponsorships and participation can also benefit your students professionally. In recent years, major tech companies, such as IBM, Google, and Apple, have stopped requiring a four-year college degree for some programming positions. By doing so, they’ve opened opportunities to individuals who have attended boot camps, completed online code challenges, or are self-taught. Considering candidates without degrees will hopefully increase diversity within these organizations’ workforces. You can help your students take advantage of these changes by offering them some career services.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">The skills your students learn throughout this book will easily transfer to the professional world. Chapter 2 touched on the idea of “Iterative You,” where students track their self-improvement throughout their education to see how their learning builds on learning into a tree of knowledge. In the professional world, we track our self-­improvement through <em class="EmphasisItalic">resumes</em>, documents that track our professional background, skills, and accomplishments.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Encourage your students to write a resume early on. Even with after-school or summer work, they won’t have much professional experience to include, so they should highlight their skills and achievements. An achievement might be a project they completed for class or a high reputation score in a coding forum. For skills, they should include the operating systems, programming languages, and software development tools they work with in school and on their own. Here is a sample skills section for a skills-based resume:</p>&#13;
<p class="ListPlainA"><strong class="EmphasisBold">Operating Systems</strong> Microsoft Windows (7 through 10), Macintosh OS</p>&#13;
<p class="ListPlainB"><strong class="EmphasisBold">Web Browsers</strong> Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge</p>&#13;

<p class="Body">The earlier your students create a basic resume, the sooner they can begin to see areas they need to work on. Have your students review resumes of other professionals online for ideas on how they can outline their skills and experience. If students read these resumes and get discouraged because of their lack of experience, remind them that experience is an iterative process and not to compare their lack of professional experience to someone else’s 10th or 20th year in the workforce. Instead, students should view professional resumes as a source of inspiration for what they want to learn next or what field they want to work in. Professional resumes can be a great resource for setting personal goals. Your students can also share their resumes with other classmates for additional ideas on how to phrase or organize them.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Every student should view their resume as a personal dashboard for keeping track of their professional progress. That progress begins in grade school and continues throughout their lives. Resumes are a catalog of personal accomplishments. Students should cultivate them with pride.</p>&#13;
<h2 class="HeadA"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>Summary</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">In this chapter, we explored ways you can build a sense of community at your school to further support your students and improve their academic outcomes. Having a strong connection to your classroom and identifying with your school will motivate your students and inspire a sense of responsibility for their academic lives. Students who feel safe and supported in their school life can focus on the educational challenges you present them.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">At the classroom level, we explored classroom meetings as a forum where students can provide feedback on what is and isn’t working in the classroom. Additionally, you can offer them choices on their classroom exercises to promote student voice and choice. By following the algorithms for conducting meetings prescribed in Robert’s Rules of Order, you can ensure that all students get an equal opportunity to contribute and be heard, and also learn to listen to one another respectfully.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">At the schoolwide level, we brought students into the policy-making and processes surrounding your organization’s IT infrastructure. By including students in a yearly revision of the AUP, they can learn why these policies are in effect, offer fair methods for enforcing them, and help educate their peers on their importance. When you include students in cataloging your IT infrastructure and revising the vision of how it should grow, they get hands-<a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>on experience in how IT departments manage and maintain technology in the professional world.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">At the local level, tying learning in school to experiences at home helps students connect the two worlds into a seamless community. With events like hackathons and code camps, you can draw parents and local businesses into the school’s academic life. With professional services like resume counseling, you can teach your students to track their academic accomplishments with a document they’ll proudly take with them into the professional world.</p>&#13;

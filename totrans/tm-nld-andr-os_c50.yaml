- en: Timing is everything. It’s true for comedy, it’s true for life overall, and
    it’s certainly true for Android’s success. For Android, it was the difference
    between being an interesting mobile platform (of which there were several at the
    time) and becoming an operating system that now runs on over three billion devices
    worldwide.

    1.0 and deliver update releases, when hardware was available and fast enough for
    this new device form factor, and on and on. But the most important element of
    timing can be summarized in one word: *competition*.'

- en: After the iPhone was announced, manufacturers were desperate for a touchscreen
    offering of their own to compete in the evolving smartphone market. Given the
    closed ecosystem of the iPhone, these other companies were on their own to create
    a compelling system, but nobody was in a good place to do that. Meanwhile, Android
    had been working on a platform that was intended to support different kinds of
    devices and requirements including, for example, a touchscreen.

    use that open source platform to create their own smartphone devices.

    GPUs, memory, and display technology all converged to enable more powerful smartphones.
    This increase in hardware capabilities enabled not only new kinds of phones, but
    also an entirely new niche of computing hardware that could break away from the
    bonds of the existing, entrenched platform players of the old PC world.

- en: Timing also had an impact on building the original team. Android was staffing
    up at a time when a core group of OS people from companies like PalmSource, Danger,
    and Microsoft were available and anxious to take on a new project together. The
    fact that all of these people joined around the same time meant that Android was
    jump-started by a group of people who not only had relevant experience, but also
    had worked together already and didn’t have to spend time building team dynamics.
    They just got down to work.

  zh: 时间把握还对原始团队的组建产生了影响。Android 在一个核心操作系统团队（来自 PalmSource、Danger 和 Microsoft 等公司）可用且渴望共同承担新项目的时刻进行了人员招聘。这些人同时加入的事实意味着，Android
    在一个拥有相关经验且已经有过合作经验的团队的推动下启动，这些团队成员不需要花时间去建立团队动态，他们只是直接开始工作。

- en: The final part of timing was that the team was able to move fast enough to capitalize
    on the opening they were given. For one thing, the team had been able to build
    up the core Android platform to a reasonable place by the time the iPhone was
    announced, so it was nearly ready for manufacturers that needed a competing solution
    quickly. Also, the team was able to pivot in reaction to the new reality of touchscreens,
    getting 1.0 and the G1 to market before other viable solutions could.

  zh: 时间把握的最终部分是，团队能够足够迅速地利用他们所获得的机会。首先，团队在 iPhone 发布时，已经能够将核心 Android 平台建设到一个合理的阶段，因此当时它几乎已经准备好供那些需要快速推出竞争方案的制造商使用。此外，团队能够根据触摸屏的新现实做出调整，成功地将
    1.0 和 G1 推向市场，领先于其他可行的解决方案。
- en: Without the unique combination of hardware capabilities that enabled smartphones,
    and the singular impact that the iPhone had on an industry thrashing about for
    a way to compete with that new device, Android may not have found a foothold,
    and would have just been another of the many failures littering the curbside of
    mobile device history. Instead, it was able to become a viable alternative at
    the right time for manufacturers across the world to ship their own smartphones,
    enabling the Android ecosystem that we know today.

  zh: 如果没有使智能手机得以实现的硬件能力的独特组合，也没有 iPhone 对一个正在苦苦寻找与新设备竞争方法的行业产生的独特影响，Android 可能无法找到立足点，最终只能成为许多失败品中的一员，沉寂于移动设备历史的街头。但相反，Android
    能够在合适的时机成为一个可行的替代品，使全球制造商能够推出自己的智能手机，促成了我们今天所知道的 Android 生态系统。

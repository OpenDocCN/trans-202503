- en: Timing is everything. It’s true for comedy, it’s true for life overall, and
    it’s certainly true for Android’s success. For Android, it was the difference
    between being an interesting mobile platform (of which there were several at the
    time) and becoming an operating system that now runs on over three billion devices
    worldwide.

    1.0 and deliver update releases, when hardware was available and fast enough for
    this new device form factor, and on and on. But the most important element of
    timing can be summarized in one word: *competition*.'

- en: After the iPhone was announced, manufacturers were desperate for a touchscreen
    offering of their own to compete in the evolving smartphone market. Given the
    closed ecosystem of the iPhone, these other companies were on their own to create
    a compelling system, but nobody was in a good place to do that. Meanwhile, Android
    had been working on a platform that was intended to support different kinds of
    devices and requirements including, for example, a touchscreen.

    use that open source platform to create their own smartphone devices.

    GPUs, memory, and display technology all converged to enable more powerful smartphones.
    This increase in hardware capabilities enabled not only new kinds of phones, but
    also an entirely new niche of computing hardware that could break away from the
    bonds of the existing, entrenched platform players of the old PC world.

- en: Timing also had an impact on building the original team. Android was staffing
    up at a time when a core group of OS people from companies like PalmSource, Danger,
    and Microsoft were available and anxious to take on a new project together. The
    fact that all of these people joined around the same time meant that Android was
    jump-started by a group of people who not only had relevant experience, but also
    had worked together already and didn’t have to spend time building team dynamics.
    They just got down to work.

- en: The final part of timing was that the team was able to move fast enough to capitalize
    on the opening they were given. For one thing, the team had been able to build
    up the core Android platform to a reasonable place by the time the iPhone was
    announced, so it was nearly ready for manufacturers that needed a competing solution
    quickly. Also, the team was able to pivot in reaction to the new reality of touchscreens,
    getting 1.0 and the G1 to market before other viable solutions could.

- en: Without the unique combination of hardware capabilities that enabled smartphones,
    and the singular impact that the iPhone had on an industry thrashing about for
    a way to compete with that new device, Android may not have found a foothold,
    and would have just been another of the many failures littering the curbside of
    mobile device history. Instead, it was able to become a viable alternative at
    the right time for manufacturers across the world to ship their own smartphones,
    enabling the Android ecosystem that we know today.

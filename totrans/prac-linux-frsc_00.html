<div class="image1"><img src="Images/common01.jpg" alt="Image" width="190" height="189"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Welcome to <em>Practical Linux Forensics: A Guide for Digital Investigators</em>. This book covers a variety of methods and techniques for finding and analyzing digital evidence found on modern Linux systems. Among digital forensic investigators, the phrase <em>Linux forensics</em> may have one of two meanings. In one case, it refers to using Linux as a digital forensics platform to perform acquisition or analysis of any target system under investigation (which could be Windows, Mac, Linux, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xviii"/>or any other operating system). In this book, however, Linux forensics refers to analyzing or examining a suspect Linux system as the target of an investigation (independent of the platform or tools used).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I will focus on identifying common artifacts found on various Linux distributions (distros) and how to analyze them in the context of a forensic investigation. The forensic analysis methods described in this book are independent of the tools used and will benefit users of FTK, X-Ways, EnCase, or any other forensic analysis tool suite. The tools I use in the examples and illustrations tend to be Linux-based, but the concepts remain fully tool independent.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1_100"><strong>Why I Wrote This Book</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In some ways, this book is a logical continuation of my first book, <em>Practical Forensic Imaging</em> (No Starch Press, 2016). After performing a forensic acquisition of a system and securing a drive image, analysis is the next step performed in a typical digital forensic investigation. This book dives into the technical details of analyzing forensic images of Linux systems.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">There are many books on Windows and even Mac forensic analysis, but few books focus on the analysis of a Linux system as the target of an investigation. Even fewer focus specifically on postmortem (dead disk) analysis of modern Linux installations. I’ve been hearing digital forensic investigators in the community increasingly comment: “We are starting to get more Linux images in our lab, but we don’t know exactly what to look for.” Such comments are coming both from forensic labs in the private sector (corporations) and the public sector (law enforcement). This book is intended to provide a resource that addresses this growing area of interest. It will help forensic investigators find and extract digital evidence found on Linux systems, reconstruct past activity, draw logical conclusions, and write comprehensive forensic evidence reports of their analysis.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Another reason for writing this book is out of personal interest and motivation to better understand the internals of modern Linux systems. Over the past decade, significant advancements in Linux distributions have changed how Linux forensic analysis is performed. I teach classes in both digital forensics and Linux at the Bern University of Applied Sciences in Switzerland, and writing this book has helped me stay current on those topics.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Finally, I wrote this book because doing technical research and writing is fun and interesting. Writing is a learning process for me as an author, and I find myself constantly filling gaps in my knowledge that I didn’t realize existed.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2_159"><strong><em>How This Book Is Unique</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This book was written as a guide for digital forensic investigators using any forensic analysis platform or tool. There is no requirement to use Linux as a platform or to use Linux-based tools. The book is intended to be a useful resource even for people using commercial digital forensic analysis tools on Windows or Mac, as long as those tools support the analysis of Linux artifacts.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This book is Linux distribution agnostic. There is no favoritism toward any particular distro and the most popular Linux distributions are used across all the examples. The research, testing, and examples used in this book have been conducted primarily with four Linux distribution families <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xix"/>and derivatives: Debian (including Ubuntu), Fedora (including Red Hat), SUSE, and Arch Linux. These four distributions are the basis for the vast majority of Linux systems in use today and are the core focus of this book. Whenever possible I try to describe concepts that are distro independent and consistent across most Linux distributions. However, many forensic artifacts are distribution specific and still need to be explained. Those are covered as well, but not as comprehensively.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This book is also architecture independent. The concepts here should apply to Linux systems installed on any CPU architecture or hardware system. The examples provided tend to focus on the 64-bit x86 PC (Intel and AMD) platform, with additional references to ARM-based Raspberry Pi systems. I might mention certain hardware peculiarities if they affect the digital forensics process in some way.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Another aspect of this book is the discussion of Linux systems with a variety of uses and purposes. I cover methods for investigating both Linux server systems as well as Linux desktop systems. A wide range of scalability is assumed, and analysis techniques are applicable from tiny embedded Linux systems and Raspberry Pis, all the way up to large server clusters and Linux-based mainframes.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The assumption throughout this book is that we are performing a postmortem forensic analysis on a drive image, also known as <em>dead disk</em> forensics. Many books cover incident response and analysis of live Linux systems using commands while logged in to a running system. This book doesn’t cover live systems and assumes that a drive image has been acquired in a forensically sound manner or that a drive is safely attached to an examination machine with a forensic write blocker. That said, everything in this book will also be useful in the context of live system incident response.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This book avoids going into too much depth on fringe or rare topics. In some cases, obscure topics might be mentioned and references provided, but the focus remains on covering the most popular Linux distributions, hardware architectures, and system applications.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This book tries to remain non-political and non-religious about technology. In the community there are often strong opinions about which technology is better or worse, which licenses are good or bad, which tech companies are altruistic or evil, and so on. I make a deliberate effort to avoid praising or criticizing any particular technology or company and avoid providing my personal opinions unless they are relevant to digital forensics.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This combination of factors provides a book that is unique in the marketplace of digital forensics books, especially among those covering topics related to forensically analyzing Linux systems.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2_160"><strong><em>Linux Forensic Analysis Scenarios</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The motivation for performing forensic analysis on target systems is wide ranging. We can divide the forensic analysis of computer systems into two broad categories: <em>victims</em> and <em>perpetrators</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the case of victims, the analysis typically involves cyberattacks, intrusions, and online social engineering incidents. These systems are owned by <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xx"/>the victims and are usually provided to forensic investigators voluntarily. For example:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Servers that have been hacked or compromised by technical exploitation of vulnerabilities or misconfiguration</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Unauthorized access to servers using stolen credentials</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Client desktops that have been compromised by malware, usually from users clicking malicious links or downloading malicious executables and scripts</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Victims of social engineering who have been tricked into performing actions they wouldn’t otherwise do</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Users who are being coerced or blackmailed into performing actions they wouldn’t otherwise do</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Computer systems that need to be analyzed as part of a larger investigation in a victimized organization</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In all of these scenarios, digital traces can be found that help reconstruct past events or provide evidence of wrongdoing.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the case of perpetrators, analysis typically involves computer systems seized by authorities or corporate investigation and incident response teams. These systems may be owned, managed, or operated by a perpetrator suspected of malicious or criminal activity. Some examples include:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Servers set up to host phishing sites or distribute malware</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Command-and-control servers used to manage botnets</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Users who have abused their access to commit malicious activity or violate organizational policy</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Desktop systems used to conduct illegal activity such as possessing or distributing illicit material, criminal hacking, or operating illegal underground forums (carding, child exploitation, and so on)</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Computer systems that need to be analyzed as part of a larger criminal investigation (organized crime, drugs, terrorism, and so on)</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Computer systems that need to be analyzed as part of a larger civil investigation (litigation or e-discovery, for example)</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In all of these scenarios, digital traces can be found that help reconstruct past events or provide evidence of wrongdoing.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When Linux systems are lawfully seized by authorities, seized by organizations who own the systems, or voluntarily provided by victims, they can be forensically imaged and then analyzed by digital forensic investigators. Linux is already a common platform for server systems as well as Internet of Things (IoT) and other embedded devices, and the use of Linux on the desktop is growing. As Linux usage increases, the number of both victim and perpetrator systems needing forensic analysis will increase.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxi"/>In some cases, especially where people have been falsely accused or are innocent and under suspicion, forensic analysis activity may also provide evidence of innocence.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1_101"><strong>Target Audience and Prerequisites</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">I wrote this book with a specific audience in mind. It is primarily aimed at digital forensics practitioners who are experienced at performing Windows, Mac, and mobile forensics and want more knowledge in the area of Linux. Forensic examiners need to know basic Linux concepts, where to find forensic artifacts, and how to interpret evidence collected. This does not mean examiners must know how to use Linux (though it can help); they need to know only what to look for and how to draw conclusions from the evidence found.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2_161"><strong><em>Who Should Read This Book?</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This book will directly benefit people working in private- and public-sector digital forensics labs who are responsible for conducting forensic examinations of computer systems, including Linux. The book specifically targets the growing number of forensic practitioners from incident response teams; computer forensic investigators within large organizations; forensic and e-discovery technicians from legal, audit, and consulting firms; and traditional forensic practitioners from law enforcement agencies. Although this book is intended primarily for experienced digital forensic investigators wanting to advance their Linux knowledge, it will benefit other groups of people, as well.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Experienced Unix and Linux administrators who want to learn digital forensic analysis and investigative techniques will also benefit from this book. This could be system administrators wanting to transition into the field of digital forensics or to leverage digital forensic methods to improve their troubleshooting skills.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Security professionals will also find this book useful. Information security risks associated with a default Linux installation may need to be assessed, resulting in security-driven changes. This may include reducing the amount of information stored on a system for confidentiality reasons. Conversely, forensic readiness requirements may result in increasing the amount of information logged or saved on a system.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Privacy advocates may find this book helpful as it highlights the amount and location of personal and private information stored on a default Linux system. People can use this book to reduce their exposure and increase the privacy of their systems (possibly resulting in the loss of functionality or convenience).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Linux application and distro developers may find this book useful as well. Potential privacy and security issues in the default configurations are shown, which may help developers create safer and more secure default settings that protect users.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxii"/>An unfortunate side effect of every digital forensics book is that criminals are also interested in what the forensics community is doing. Malicious actors look for new ways to exploit systems and subvert security, including forensic analysis techniques. Throughout the book, I mention the topic of anti-forensics when relevant. Forensic examiners should be aware of potential anti-forensic techniques used to manipulate or destroy evidence.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2_162"><strong><em>Prerequisite Knowledge</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The prerequisite knowledge needed to get the most benefit from this book can be described in one of two ways:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li class="noindent">People with digital forensics knowledge, but limited knowledge of Linux</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">People with Linux knowledge, but limited knowledge of digital forensics</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="indent">People with experience performing digital forensic analysis of Windows or Mac systems will learn to translate those same skills to Linux systems. Familiarity with digital forensic analysis will make it easier to learn new areas of Linux.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">People with experience working with Linux systems, especially troubleshooting and debugging, will learn how to apply those skills to digital forensic analysis. Familiarity with Linux will make it easier to learn new digital forensics concepts.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Regardless of whether your background is forensics or Linux, there is an expectation that you understand basic operating system concepts. This includes a basic understanding of booting, system initialization, logging, processes, storage, software installation, and so on. Having some expertise with any operating system should be enough to understand the general principles that apply to all operating systems, including Linux.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2_163"><strong><em>Forensic Tools and Platforms Needed</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">To perform the analysis techniques described here, any full-featured digital forensic toolkit can be used. Common commercial tools in the industry include EnCase, FTK, X-Ways, and others. These can all be used to perform Linux analysis work.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Having a Linux-based analysis system available is not required, but may be easier in some cases. Most of the examples shown in the book are demonstrated using Linux tools on a Linux system.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The book doesn’t cover how to find, download, compile, or install various tools or Linux distributions. If you have a reasonably new machine (a year before this book’s publication date) with a recent distribution of Linux, the examples should work without any issues. Some of the tools used are not part of standard (default) Linux distributions, but can easily be found via internet search engines or on GitHub, GitLab, or other online platforms. In most cases, I’ll provide references to online sources.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1_102"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxiii"/><strong>Scope and Organization</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This section describes the scope of the book, how the book is organized, and the structure of the individual sections.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2_164"><strong><em>Content Scope</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This is a book on postmortem digital forensic analysis, which means the drive images containing digital evidence have already been secured in a forensically sound manner (by using write blockers, for example) and are ready for examination. The examination process includes identifying various aspects of the drive contents, searching for specific content, extracting evidence traces, interpreting information, reconstructing past events, and gaining a full understanding of the contents of the drive. This analysis activity will allow investigators to draw conclusions and create forensic reports about a particular case or incident.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The broader scope of the book is the “modern” aspect of Linux. In my <em>Modern Linux</em> class, students often ask what <em>Modern</em> means in this context. I didn’t want my course to be based on converted Unix material, but rather wanted to focus on aspects unique to Linux. Linux has Unix foundations, but has also drifted away from Unix in significant ways. The most fundamental (and controversial) example of this is systemd, which is used in most Linux distributions today and is covered extensively in this book. Other topics included under my modern Linux definition include: UEFI booting, new kernel features like cgroups and namespaces, D-Bus communication, Wayland and the standards at <em><a href="http://freedesktop.org">freedesktop.org</a></em>, newer filesystems like btrfs, new encryption protocols like WireGuard, rolling-release models, universal software packaging, and other new topics associated with the latest Linux distributions.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Some topics are too large, too diverse, or too obscure for inclusion in this book. In such cases, I’ll describe the topic at a high level and provide pointers on where to find more information. One example is the analysis of Linux backups. So many different backup solutions exist that writing about all of them could easily take up a significant portion of the book. Another example is Android forensics. Even though Android is based on Linux, it is such a large topic that it could easily fill a book on its own (and indeed many Android forensics books are on the market today). There are many highly customized Linux distributions designed for embedded systems and specialized hardware (robotics, automotive, medical, and so on). These custom and specialty systems may be mentioned here, but detailed coverage is outside the book’s scope.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Writing a book about free and open source software (FOSS) is challenging because everything is constantly changing at a rapid pace. By the time this book reaches the market, there will very likely be new topics that are not included here, or it’s possible that topics I’ve written about are no longer relevant. The biggest changes tend to be Linux distribution specific, so wherever possible I focus on distribution-independent topics. Overall, I cover stable topics that are not expected to change significantly in the coming years.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxiv"/>The content in this book is not exhaustive, and there are certainly forensic artifacts missing. The FOSS community is all about choice, and choice means far too many different possibilities to include in a single book. Out of practical necessity, this book focuses on the most popular technologies and Linux distros. Less popular, obscure, or fringe technologies are left out of the scope. However, the forensic analysis principles shown here can usually be applied to those technologies that are not covered.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The goal here is not to teach people how to use Linux. It is to teach people what to look for in terms of digital forensic artifacts. You don’t need to be a Linux expert for this book to be useful.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2_165"><strong><em>Book Organization and Structure</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">I spent a lot of time thinking about how to organize this book. It needed to be comprehensive and approachable for people unfamiliar to the topic. It also needed to be obvious from the table of contents that this is a forensics book before it is a Linux book. Thus, the structure shouldn’t look like a general Linux book.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The most obvious way to organize this book is by grouping chapters and sections by Linux technology (boot process, storage, networking, and so on). Each section dives deeper into the different Linux subsystems, resulting in a structure looking similar to most Linux technical books. This structure is useful for people who already have some Linux knowledge and know exactly what they are looking for in terms of forensic artifacts.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Another way to organize the book is chronologically according to a typical forensic examination. Here each step of a typical forensic analysis is covered in detail, but with a focus on Linux. The structure would look similar to most computer forensics books that focus on Microsoft Windows analysis (probably the majority of computer forensics work today). This was partly what I wanted, but it’s still very focused on the user’s desktop. I wanted the book to be useful for analyzing the various Linux distros, desktop systems, server systems, and embedded Linux systems.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The most comprehensive and systematic way to organize this book would be to focus on the filesystem layout and describe each directory of the filesystem tree with the relevant forensic artifacts. This bottom-up approach would exhaustively cover every part of the operating system’s storage, which is fitting for a postmortem analysis book. However, such a structure would resemble a dictionary rather than a book intended to teach and explain concepts.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I opted for a combination of all three approaches. The chapters and sections are organized by Linux technology, grouped at a high level. The subsections are organized by digital forensic analysis tasks and goals. I tried to cover all the relevant areas of the Linux filesystem in the forensics subsections. The appendix also contains a listing of the files covered in the book with a brief comment on their forensic relevance.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The book is divided into chapters covering broad topic areas of a Linux system. Those chapters are divided into sections that cover the major components of each topic area. The sections are further divided into subsections that go into the individual details of particular forensic analysis techniques. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxv"/>Most subsections follow a common format that is presented in a series of paragraphs. The first paragraph provides an introduction or overview of the technical topic under examination, sometimes with historical context. The second paragraph explains what information can be extracted and why this is useful in the context of forensic investigations. Subsequent paragraphs show examples and explain how to analyze this information and extract it as digital evidence. A final paragraph may be included to mention any caveats, gotchas, additional tips, and concerns related to evidence integrity and reliability.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The book starts with a general overview of digital forensics where I cover the history and evolution of the topic, and mention significant events that have shaped the field. I give special emphasis to the standards needed to produce digital evidence that can be used in a court of law. The overall book strives to be international and independent of regional jurisdictions because more and more criminal investigations span country borders and involve multiple jurisdictions. The book also provides an introduction to modern Linux systems, including the history, culture, and all the components that make up a “modern” Linux system today. After providing this dual foundation, the rest of the book focuses on the forensic analysis of Linux systems.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Throughout this book, I try to demonstrate how Locard’s exchange principle can be applied to the analysis of Linux systems. Edmond Locard was a French criminal investigator who postulated that when committing a crime, both the criminal and the scene of the crime would exchange evidence. This principle can also be applied to digital crime scenes, electronic devices, and online connectivity.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Digital forensics books often have a separate chapter dedicated to the topic of encryption. However, encryption today is pervasive and part of every computing subsystem. In this book, the encryption topic will be integrated into every relevant section rather than being discussed in a separate chapter. However, the filesystems chapter does have a dedicated section on storage encryption.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Rather than a chronological list of steps, this book is intended to be more of a cookbook of tasks grouped by technological area. The book is also designed as a reference, so you don’t need to read it from beginning to end (except for the first two overview chapters). Certain sections assume some knowledge and understanding of prior sections, but helpful and appropriate references are noted.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I begin the sections in each chapter with a brief introduction to the technology behind the topic, followed by questions and comments from a digital forensics perspective. I describe potential evidence investigators might find, together with pointers to the location of that evidence. I show examples of extracting and analyzing the evidence, and give tips for interpreting that evidence. I also comment on the challenges, risks, caveats, and other potential pitfalls, and I provide words of caution and advice based on my experience as a forensic investigator.</p>&#13;

<p class="noindentin"><strong><a href="app01.xhtml">Appendix: File/Directory List for Digital Investigators</a></strong> This resource provides a table of the files and directories covered throughout the book. It is intended as a reference to allow investigators to quickly look up a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxviii"/>particular file or directory and find a short description with the digital forensic relevance. This is a living appendix, and an updated version is available on my website: <em><a href="https://digitalforensics.ch/linux/">https://digitalforensics.ch/linux/</a></em>. Many thanks to No Starch Press for allowing me to maintain an independent version of this appendix.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1_103"><strong>Conventions and Format</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The internet provides vast amounts of resources in the form of blogs, videos, and websites. The quality, accuracy, and completeness of those resources can be good, but they can also be poor or even outright false. Where possible, I’ll refer readers to authoritative sources of information outside the book. When performing digital forensic investigations, having accurate information is critical. Authoritative sources typically include the original developers of software (documentation, source code, support forums), standards bodies (such as RFCs and <em><a href="http://freedesktop.org">freedesktop.org</a></em>), peer-reviewed scientific research (such as <em>DFRWS</em> and Forensic Science International’s <em>Digital Investigation</em> journal), and professional technical books (like many No Starch Press titles).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I’ll often refer to the standard Linux documentation, or manual pages, that come with most Linux software packages. These are also known as <em>man pages</em>, and together with a section number appear as follows: systemd(1). The Linux shell command to view this man page with the section number is <span class="literal">man 1 systemd</span>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Certain styles and conventions are used throughout this book. Each chapter covers a different aspect of Linux forensic analysis. Each section within a chapter typically provides a set of command line tasks with corresponding output and explanations. Subsections may provide different variations of a task or further features of a particular tool used. However, these are only examples for illustration. The focus is not on how to use Linux tools, and any forensic analysis tools should be able to replicate the results.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Examples of code, commands, and command output are displayed in a monospace or fixed-width font, similar to what you see on a computer terminal screen. The ellipsis symbol (<span class="literal">...</span>) is used to snip out portions of command output that are not directly relevant to the message conveyed in the example, which helps to simplify examples and improve clarity. File and directory names are displayed in an <em>italic font</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Throughout the book, in the file contents, code, and command output examples, I’ll use <em>pc1</em> to refer to the hostname of the system under analysis. If a Linux username is shown, I call them <em>sam</em> (for Samantha or Samuel). These names have no special significance except for the fact that they are both short and unlikely to be confused with the rest of the example output (no duplicate words).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the computer book industry, it is common practice to change the timestamps in blocks of code and command output to a point in the future after the book’s release, giving the contents a newer appearance. As with my previous book, I felt that writing about forensic evidence integrity and then <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxix"/>manipulating the very evidence provided in the book (by forward-dating timestamps) isn’t appropriate. In addition, changing visible dates in the examples may cause dates in encoded data to be inconsistent or cause forensic timelines to be false. The output of a particular tool might also be different when performed at a later point in time. I wanted to avoid these risks of inconsistency. All the command output you see in this book reflects the actual output from testing and research, including the original dates and timestamps. Aside from snipping out less relevant areas with <span class="literal">...</span> and renaming host and user names with <em>pc1</em> or <em>sam</em>, the command output is unchanged.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I refer to the investigator’s or examiner’s workstation as the <em>analysis host</em> or <em>examination host</em>. I refer to the disk or image undergoing analysis as the <em>subject drive</em>, <em>suspect drive</em>, or <em>evidence drive</em>. I use those terms interchangeably.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Several other terms are also used interchangeably throughout the book. <em>Disk</em>, <em>drive</em>, <em>image</em>, <em>media</em>, and <em>storage</em> are often used interchangeably when used in a generic sense. <em>Forensic investigator</em>, <em>examiner</em>, and <em>analyst</em> are used throughout the book and refer to the person (you) using the examination host for various forensic tasks. <em>Imaging</em> and <em>acquiring</em> are used interchangeably, but the word <em>copying</em> is deliberately excluded to avoid confusion with regular file copying (which is not part of the forensics process).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A bibliography is not provided at the end of the book or end of the chapters. All references are included as footnotes at the bottom of the page that references them, or mentioned directly in the text.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2_167"><strong><em>Formatting and Presentation</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The contents of files, code, commands, and command output are shown in monospace font, separate from the rest of the book’s text. If an example of a shell command is shown, it will be in bold. In some cases, this may be a command you can enter on your own analysis machine. In other cases, it was only for illustration using my test system (and not intended for you to enter). Here are some examples of commands entered:</p>&#13;
<pre>$ <span class="codestrong1">tool.sh &gt; ~/file.txt</span>&#13;
$ <span class="codestrong1">tool.sh &lt; ~/file.txt</span>&#13;
$ <span class="codestrong1">tool.sh | othertool.sh</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here is an example of the contents of a file:</p>&#13;
<pre>system_cache_dir=/var/cache/example/&#13;
user_cache_dir=~/.cache/example/&#13;
...&#13;
activity_log=/var/log/example.log&#13;
error_log=/var/log/example.err&#13;
...&#13;
system_config=/etc/example.conf&#13;
user_config=~/.config/example/example.conf&#13;
...</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxx"/>For readers less familiar with Linux, the tilde shown in directory path names (~/) always represents the user’s home directory. So <em>~/file.txt</em> is the same as <em>/home/sam/file.txt</em> (where <em>sam</em> is a normal user account on the system). When a directory name is shown, it will have a trailing forward slash (/).</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2_168"><strong><em>Data Flow Diagrams</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Forensic analysis involves locating traces of evidence and reconstructing past activity. To achieve this goal, we must understand where interesting data (potential evidence) is flowing and being stored. The diagrams used in this book illustrate the flow of data between programs, daemons, hosts, or other data processing systems (over a network). The files and directories that are interesting from a forensic evidence perspective are also shown in diagrams.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="ch00.xhtml#ch00fig01">Figure 1</a> shows a fictitious system to explain the diagrams used throughout the book. The boxes indicate the source or destination of interesting data (files, programs, and other machines). The lines indicate an associated flow of data (read/received or written/sent).</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch00fig01" src="Images/fmfig01.jpg" alt="Image" width="658" height="267"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 1: Example data flow diagram</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In this example system, the program (<em>example.py</em>) is at the heart of the diagram. A remote host and a daemon are exchanging data (a daemon is a program running in the background). There are configuration files, logfiles, temporary files, and cached data.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In some diagrams, I may include arrows to indicate a direction of flow, rather than just the association. In some diagrams, I may have a box representing a simplified view consisting of several programs (creating an abstraction when other details are not useful to know).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The diagrams in this book are not intended to be complete. They show only the components interesting from a digital forensics perspective within the context of the given section. Using diagrams like this helps visualize the location of potential forensic evidence on the Linux system.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Writing this book was a lot of fun and I hope you enjoy reading it. For the forensic investigators and security incident response people, I hope you learn a lot about how to analyze Linux systems. For the Linux engineers and enthusiasts, I hope this helps you leverage digital forensic investigations to perform troubleshooting and debugging.</p>&#13;

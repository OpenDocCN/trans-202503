<div class="imagel"><img alt="Image" src="../images/common.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In information security, we refer to people as the “weak link” of security programs. Regardless of the security measures you set, you have little control over your employees who might click dangerous links, send sensitive information via unprotected channels, hand over passwords, or post important data in conspicuous places.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Worse yet, attackers can take advantage of these tendencies to conduct <em>social engineering attacks</em> that manipulate people to gain information or access to facilities. These attacks usually rely on the willingness of people to help others, particularly when faced with someone who appears to be in distress, someone intimidating (such as a high-up manager), or someone who seems familiar.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">That said, you can take measures to protect your organization from these attacks by setting appropriate policies and teaching your employees <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_108"/>to recognize danger. In this chapter, you’ll learn about the kind of data attackers might collect, several types of social engineering attacks, and how to set up an effective security training program to inform your staff.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch08lev1sec1">Gathering Information for Social Engineering Attacks</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">To protect your organization, you’ll need to know how social engineers collect data. People can gather information about individuals and organizations more quickly today than ever before. A staggering wealth of information exists in online databases, public records, and social media sites, and in many cases, this data is free for the taking. Many people post detailed personal information regarding their day-to-day activities for the entire world to see.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Once an attacker collects information about internal processes, people, or systems, they can use it to conduct sophisticated attacks. If an attacker called a company and flat-out asked for a report containing sensitive sales data, the person on the other end would likely refuse. On the other hand, if an attacker used social engineering techniques by calling in a panicked voice and asked for a copy of the latest TPS-13 report from the sales directory on the SalesCom server because they have a meeting with Mr. Kurosawa in 15 minutes and their laptop just crashed, they’re more likely to succeed. (This is a social engineering attack known as pretexting. I’ll discuss it in more detail later in this chapter.)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">It’s worth knowing what kind of information attackers might use in cases such as the one just discussed. When protecting people and commercial organizations, you should look at two primary sources of information: human intelligence and open source intelligence.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec1"><em>Human Intelligence</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A chief tool for military and law enforcement organizations across the world, <em>human intelligence (HUMINT)</em> is data gathered by talking to people. HUMINT data might include personal observations, people’s schedules, sensitive information, or any of a number of other similar items. You can collect HUMINT with hostile techniques such as torture or by tricking participants with subtle scams. Security professionals focus on the latter.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For example, you might use HUMINT as the basis for conducting other social engineering attacks. You could observe the traffic going in and out of an office building and notice that the office receives frequent package deliveries and that a shift change happens at 8 <small>AM</small> every morning, causing many people to enter and exit the building at the same time. You’d have a much better chance of entering the facility in an unauthorized manner during this busy time, while dressed in a familiar delivery uniform.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec2"><em>Open Source Intelligence</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><em>Open source intelligence (OSINT)</em> is information collected from publicly available sources, such as job postings and public records. This publicly available <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_109"/>data can reveal an enormous amount of useful data, including the technologies in use in a particular organization, the organization’s structures, and the specific names of people and their positions. OSINT is one of the primary sources of information on which to base social engineering attacks.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Résumés and Job Postings</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In résumés, you might find work histories, skill sets, and hobbies, which an attacker can use to set up social engineering attacks based on the target’s skills or interests. In job listings, companies often expose information that they would otherwise consider sensitive, including office and data center locations, network or security infrastructure details, and the software in use. Recruiters might consider it necessary to post this information for the hiring process, but attackers can also use it to plan attacks or add focus to future surveillance efforts.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For example, if you collect information about a company and determine it runs Windows servers in its cloud hosting environment and uses CompanyX antivirus software, you’ve just dramatically reduced the number of variables you must consider when planning attacks against the company. If you collect additional information about the location and members of their information security team, you might also be able to predict the skill level and timing of any responses to your attack, making your attack more effective.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Social Media</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Attackers can easily collect OSINT using social media tools, such as Facebook and Twitter, by following someone’s activities, finding their friends and other social contacts, and even tracking their physical location. They can use this information to monitor people or take more direct action, such as blackmail. In many cases, younger people tend to document questionable activities more willingly and may provide a richer source for this type of information.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Attempts to manipulate the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election provide an example of how attackers can take advantage of social media tools. In the months preceding the election, the Russian-based company Internet Research Agency purchased approximately 3,500 Facebook ads intended to incite tensions among targeted groups of voters by touching on themes such as race, policing, and immigration. In February 2018, a US federal grand jury indicted 13 Russians working for Internet Research Agency for these activities.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch08fn1" id="kch08fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> This is a classic example of social engineering, which I’ll discuss in detail later in this chapter.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Public Records</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Public records can provide a wealth of information about a target, including evidence of mortgages, marriages, divorces, legal proceedings, and parking tickets. Attackers often use this data to conduct additional searches and locate even more information.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_110"/>What exactly constitutes a public record can vary based on the geographical location of the record and the agency that holds it. In the United States, the laws in each state differ, so information that you may access legally in one state may be illegal in another.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Google Hacking</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Google and other search engines are an excellent resource for information gathering, particularly when attackers make use of advanced search operators, such as the following:</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentintt"><strong>site</strong> Limits results to a specific site (site:<a href="http://nostarch.com">nostarch.com</a>)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentint"><strong>filetype</strong> Limits results to a specific file type (filetype:pdf)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentint"><strong>intext</strong> Finds pages containing a words or words (intext:security)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentintb1"><strong>inurl</strong> Finds pages containing a word or words in the URL (inurl:security)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can combine these operators into a single search to retrieve specific results. For instance, entering <strong>site:<a href="http://nostarch.com">nostarch.com</a> intext:andress security</strong> into a search should return the publisher’s page for this book, as shown in <a href="#ch8fig1">Figure 8-1</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch8fig1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/08fig01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 8-1: Google search operators at work</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The Google Hacking Database (<em><a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database/">https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database/</a></em>), shown in <a href="#ch8fig2">Figure 8-2</a>, contains canned Google searches that make use of advanced search operators to find specific vulnerabilities or security issues, such as files that contain passwords or vulnerable configurations and services.</p>&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_111"/>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch8fig2"><img alt="Image" src="../images/08fig02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 8-2: The Google Hacking Database</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Not only does this provide a set of preassembled searches that you can click easily, but it also demonstrates some of the more complex ways that you can use search operators. For example, the bottom search in <a href="#ch8fig2">Figure 8-2</a> shows you a combination of three different operators (inurl:, intext:, and ext:). You could easily switch out the terms to repurpose the search for your own use.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">File Metadata</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><em>Metadata</em> is the data about data found in almost any file that can reveal not only mundane information such as timestamps and file statistics but also more interesting data such as usernames, server names, network file paths, and deleted or updated information. File metadata provides data for searches, sorting, file processing, and so on, and it generally isn’t immediately visible to users. Many professional forensic tools, such as EnCase (<em><a href="https://www.guidancesoftware.com/encase-forensic/">https://www.guidancesoftware.com/encase-forensic/</a></em>), have specific features to quickly and easily recover these data types in forensic investigations.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Image and video file metadata, called <em>EXIF data</em>, includes information such as the camera settings and hardware. You can view and edit EXIF data with ExifTool (<em><a href="https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/">https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/</a></em>), a great cross-platform tool that works with a wide variety of file types. Especially <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_112"/>in document files that have been around for a while and edited by multiple people, the amount of metadata that they contain may surprise you. Try downloading and using it to analyze a few documents or image files.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Image files produced by devices containing Global Positioning System (GPS) information might also contain location coordinates; many smartphones embed users’ location information into image files if they’ve enabled the location setting on the camera, which means uploading these images to the internet could leak sensitive data.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A multitude of tools exist to assist with information gathering from OSINT (and other) sources. Two of the more common and well-known among these tools are Shodan and Maltego.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Shodan</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Shodan, shown in <a href="#ch8fig3">Figure 8-3</a>, is a web-based search engine that looks for information saved on internet-connected devices.</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch8fig3"><img alt="Image" src="../images/08fig03.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 8-3: Shodan</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Shodan allows you to search for specific information, such as particular hardware, software, or open ports. For example, if you knew of a vulnerable version of a specific File Transfer Protocol (FTP) service, you could ask Shodan for a list of all its instances in its database. Likewise, you could ask Shodan for everything that it knows about a domain or server and instantly see where specific vulnerabilities might be present.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_113"/>Maltego</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Maltego (<em><a href="https://www.paterva.com/">https://www.paterva.com/</a></em>), shown in <a href="#ch8fig4">Figure 8-4</a>, is an intelligence-gathering tool that uses relationships between particular points of data, called <em>transforms</em>, to discover information related to information that you already have.</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch8fig4"><img alt="Image" src="../images/08fig04.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 8-4: Maltego</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For example, you might start by giving Maltego a website’s domain name and then use a transform to find names and email addresses listed on the website. From these names and email addresses, you could find other addresses and names based on the same mail format elsewhere on the internet. You could also find the server Internet Protocol (IP) addresses that host the domain and then find other domains hosted on the same server.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Maltego displays the results of your search on a graph that shows the links between each of the items discovered. You can use the graph to conduct additional searches on specific items by clicking them and selecting a new transform.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec3"><em>Other Kinds of Intelligence</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">OSINT and HUMINT are by no means the only kinds of intelligence you can gather. You may also see references to these other types:</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentintt"><strong>Geospatial intelligence (GEOINT)</strong> Geographical information, typically from satellites.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentint"><strong>Measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT)</strong> Measurement and signature data from sensors, such as optical or weather readers. MASINT contains some sensor-specific kinds of intelligence, such as RADINT, or information collected from radar.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentint"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_114"/><strong>Signals intelligence (SIGINT)</strong> Data gathered by intercepting signals between people or systems. You may also see this called communications intelligence (COMINT) when referring to communications between people and electronic intelligence (ELINT) when referring to communications between systems.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentint"><strong>Technical intelligence (TECHINT)</strong> Intelligence about equipment, technology, and weapons, often collected with the purpose of developing countermeasures.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentint"><strong>Financial intelligence (FININT)</strong> Data about the financial dealings and transactions of companies and individuals, often acquired from financial institutions.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentintb1"><strong>Cyber intelligence/Digital network intelligence (CYBINT/DNINT)</strong> Intelligence gathered from computer systems and networks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Most other types of intelligence will fit into one of these categories.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch08lev1sec2">Types of Social Engineering Attacks</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This section discusses some of the social engineering attacks a person could conduct with the information gathered in the previous section.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec4"><em>Pretexting</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In <em>pretexting</em>, attackers use information they’ve gathered to assume the guise of a manager, customer, reporter, co-worker’s family member, or other trusted person. Using a fake identity, they create believable scenarios that convince their targets to give up sensitive information or perform actions they wouldn’t normally do for strangers.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">An attacker could use pretexting in face-to-face encounters or over some communication medium. Direct interactions require a heightened level of attention to details such as body language, while indirect encounters, such as those conducted over the phone or through email, require a stronger focus on verbal mannerisms. Both types require good communication and psychological skills, specialized knowledge, and a quick mind.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Pretexting gives social engineers an advantage. For example, if the social engineer can drop names, provide details about the organization, and give the target sufficient cause to believe that they’re entitled to the information or access for which they’re asking—or, for that matter, that they already have it—their chances of success increase substantially.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec5"><em>Phishing</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><em>Phishing</em> is a social engineering technique in which an attacker uses electronic communications such as email, texting, or phone calls to collect the target’s personal information or install malware on their system, often by convincing the target to click a malicious link.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The fake sites used in web-based phishing attacks typically resemble well-known websites, such as banking, social media, or shopping sites. Some <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_115"/>look obviously fake, with poor imitations of the company’s logo and terrible grammar, while others are extremely difficult to distinguish from the legitimate page. Fortunately, many browsers have improved security in recent years and now render phishing attacks more difficult by showing warnings like the one in <a href="#ch8fig5">Figure 8-5</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch8fig5"><img alt="Image" src="../images/08fig05.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 8-5: A phishing warning</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Even without these warnings, however, most phishing attacks fail unless the target has an account on the site being faked; someone who doesn’t have a MyBank bank account won’t fall for a phishing attack that redirects to a fake MyBank bank website. Even if the target does have an account, people have become more cautious of unsolicited emails from their banks or other websites. In general, phishing attacks rely on a lack of attention to detail on the recipient’s part, and their rate of success remains low.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To achieve higher rates of success, attackers may turn to <em>spear phishing</em>, or targeted attacks against specific companies, organizations, or people. A spear phishing attack requires advanced reconnaissance so that the message appears to come from someone the target would trust, such as human resources staff, a manager, the corporate IT support team, a peer, or a friend.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">While a normal phishing attacks might appear clumsy and poorly constructed, aimed at tricking a small percentage of a large pool of recipients, spear phishing attacks take the opposite approach. For example, spear attackers typically send clean emails containing the expected logos, graphics, and signature block, and they’ll disguise any malicious links present. If the attack exists to steal credentials for a site or service, the attacker may even use the freshly stolen credentials to log the target into the real site, leaving no error message or broken session to clue them in that something strange took place.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec6"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_116"/><em>Tailgating</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Physical <em>tailgating</em>, or piggybacking, is the act of following someone through an access control point, such as secure door, instead of using the credentials, badge, or key normally needed to enter. The authorized person may let you in intentionally or accidentally.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Tailgating happens in almost any place that uses technical access controls, partly because of the carelessness of authorized users and partly because most people tend to avoid confrontation. A few tricks of equipment, such as knowing which props to use, and the use of psychology to allow attackers to play on the sympathies of others will aid them in their tailgating efforts.</p>&#13;

<p class="noindent">Visit Chris Hadnagy’s website <em><a href="https://www.social-engineer.com/">https://www.social-engineer.com/</a></em> and his excellent book <em>Social Engineering: The Science of Human Hacking</em> for more information about social engineering. Hadnagy goes into much greater depth than I do here about what social engineering attacks can do.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch08lev1sec3">Building Security Awareness with Security Training Programs</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">To protect your organization, you’ll have to build security awareness in your users by instituting a security training program. These programs often consist of instructor-led or computer-based lessons conducted during the new-employee onboarding process, followed up with mandatory quizzes. You might also repeat the training at regular intervals so the employee retains the information.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This section outlines some of the topics you should typically cover in these training programs.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec7"><em>Passwords</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Although you can use technical tools to make sure users choose strong passwords, you can’t easily control what users will do with those passwords. An employee could write their password down and stick it to the underside of their keyboard, for example, or share it with other users for convenience’s sake.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Another kind of harmful behavior is using the same password for multiple accounts. Even if you force a user to create a strong password on a given system in the workplace, the user might manually synchronize all other systems in the organization to the same password (including their virtual private network credentials allowing external access to the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_117"/>organization’s networks) and then proceed to go home and do the same with their internet forum credentials, email, and online gaming passwords to make their life easier. Unfortunately, if an attacker compromises the password database for their forum and publishes the user’s email address and decrypted password, the attacker gains access to a disturbing amount of information—possibly including instructions for connecting to the company VPN that the user emailed to their home address.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Poor password hygiene is, unfortunately, a difficult problem to solve by technical means, and education is one of the best ways of tackling it. You should push users to create strong passwords even when they’re not directly forced to do so, tell them not to leave or record their passwords where they might easily be compromised, and ask them not to use the same password repeatedly across multiple systems or applications.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec8"><em>Social Engineering Training</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Training users to recognize and respond to social engineering attacks can be an incredibly arduous task because such attacks take advantage of our behavioral norms and tendencies. Thankfully, public awareness about phishing emails and fraud in general has grown.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Broadly, you should teach your users to be suspicious of anything that seems unusual, including atypical requests or emails in their inboxes and strangers in their working environments, even when these occurrences seem wrapped in a layer of normalcy.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Ask people to <em>trust but verify</em> when faced with even the slightest doubt. Your users may flood your security operations center with calls and emails, but at least they won’t wire thousands of dollars to someone in a foreign country claiming to be the company vice president who was mugged while on a sales trip and is in dire need of funds to return home.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec9"><em>Network Usage</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You should discuss proper network usage with your users. As I’ll cover in <a href="ch10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, people today have access to a variety of networks, both wired and wireless, from relatively restricted ones in the workplace to wide-open networks in homes, coffee shops, and airports.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">An uneducated user might assume that connecting a laptop to the network in a conference room at work is the same as connecting to the wireless network in a hotel, which is also the same as connecting to a network in an airport. Generally, people treat accessing networks in the same way they treat accessing any utility, like the power provided by a wall outlet or the light given off by a lamp; they expect it to be there and to function as expected. Beyond this, most people don’t think too much about the risks present.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You should guide users toward behaviors that will protect the enterprise network. That means you shouldn’t typically allow foreign devices to connect to it. Users need to know they can’t allow vendors to plug in a device in a conference room and that they shouldn’t connect their iPads to the production network, for example. You should instead provide a proper alternative <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_118"/>network that outside devices can use, like a guest wireless network, and make sure that users know how to connect to it, as well as the parameters within which they can use it.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Also, you should restrict the use of corporate resources on outside networks, a problem that has bitten many organizations badly over time. If you load your laptop with sensitive data and then connect to the network at the local coffee shop or hotel, you may accidentally share this data with everyone else on the network.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">An easy technical solution to this problem is to implement a VPN that allows users to access the corporate network. You should configure the VPN client to automatically connect the device to the VPN whenever it finds itself on a foreign network. Additionally, you should teach your users to avoid connecting devices containing sensitive information to insecure networks.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec10"><em>Malware</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Educating users about malware generally involves teaching them not to indiscriminately click things. While they’re surfing the web, opening email attachments, navigating social networks, and using smartphones, they should look out for the following common red flags:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">Email attachments from people they don’t know</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">Email attachments containing file types that are potentially executable and could contain malware, such as EXE, ZIP, and PDF</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">Web links using shortened URLs such as <em><a href="http://bit.ly/">http://bit.ly/</a></em> (if in doubt, they can verify the destination of shortened URLs with tools like <em><a href="https://linkexpander.com/">https://linkexpander.com/</a></em> or <em><a href="http://unshorten.me/">http://unshorten.me/</a></em>)</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">Web links with names that differ slightly from those you expect (<em>myco.org</em> instead of <em><a href="http://myco.com">myco.com</a></em>, for example)</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">Smartphone applications from nonofficial download sites</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">Pirated software</p></li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you instill a healthy sense of paranoia in your users, they’ll call your help desk or security team to ask questions before immediately clicking suspicious links.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec11"><em>Personal Equipment</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You should set rules for when and how employees can use personal equipment in the workplace. Typically, you might allow them to use it at the <em>border</em> of the organization’s network; that means you’d let them bring their laptops to work and attach them to a guest wireless network but not to the same network as the company’s production systems.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You should also be sure to communicate that these policies apply to devices such as vendor laptops or mobile devices that can connect to networks.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec12"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_119"/><em>Clean Desk Policies</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A <em>clean desk policy</em> states that sensitive information shouldn’t be left unattended on a desk for any significant period of time, such as overnight or during a lunch break. When introducing such a policy, you should also discuss how to properly dispose of sensitive data stored on physical media, such as paper or tape, by using shred bins, data destruction services, and media shredders.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec13"><em>Familiarity with Policy and Regulatory Knowledge</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Last, but certainly not least, if you expect your users to follow the rules, you need to communicate them effectively. You probably won’t actually educate them if you just send an email to all users containing a link to a lengthy policy and then have them attest to having read it. Instead, you might try condensing the most critical part of your policy into a kind of crib notes or highlights reel to make sure users retain the key points.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Also, if you’re creating a training presentation, you can try to make it more engaging. For instance, if you have an hour allotted to conducting security awareness training for newly hired employees, you might shorten your lecture portion to 30 minutes and then spend the second half of the time conducting an interactive quiz show–style game on the material you just covered. Once you’ve added an element of competition by dividing the class into teams and adding an incentive (such as prizes for the winners), you’ll have created a more interesting environment.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can also get your users’ attention with posters, giveaways of pens or coffee mugs, and newsletters. If you present the information through repeated and varied avenues, you’re more likely to educate users in the long term.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch08lev1sec4">Summary</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you explored a variety of issues concerning the human element of information security: the security issues that you can’t address by technical means alone. Whether because of mere carelessness or targeted social engineering attacks, the people who staff your organizations pose a security challenge that you can’t directly address with technical controls.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I discussed types of social engineering attacks, and you saw how attackers put these techniques to use to solicit information or coerce unauthorized actions from people in your organizations. I also covered how to build security awareness and training programs. Common issues to discuss with users include protecting passwords, recognizing social engineering attacks and malware, using networks and personal equipment safely, and adhering to a clean desk policy. If you make your security awareness and training programs engaging, this information is more likely to stick with users over time.</p>&#13;

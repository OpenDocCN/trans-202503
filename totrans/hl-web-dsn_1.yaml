    is a fancy way of asking, “What percentage of people are doing what I want them
    to do?” Once you’ve defined what “success” looks like for your website, you can
    make better decisions about your design, measure how well your current design
    works, and improve your conversion rate.

    every comment you receive. File them away in your mind, or keep a list, and then
    take care of all of those changes once you’ve heard from several people. Sometimes
    you’ll get contradictory feedback from two different people, and that’s fine (if
    one of them more closely fits the profile of your target user, that person’s feedback
    is more important!). Maybe there’s a third approach that could make everyone happy,
    or maybe it’s not worth worrying about that piece yet.

    easier to read and more modern, airy, and inviting.

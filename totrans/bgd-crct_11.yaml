    for creating great things with electronics. If you’re new to electronics, you
    might not have understood all the details of each circuit in this book, but that’s
    okay. This book was all about building circuits and improving your practical electronics
    skills.

    build your own, check out my book *Electronics for Kids* (No Starch Press, 2016),
    which will teach you electronics from scratch, even if you’re not necessarily
    a “kid” anymore.

    more advanced things, like use graphical displays, create melodies, and connect
    to the internet, I recommend exploring a popular device called Arduino (*[https://www.arduino.cc/](https://www.arduino.cc/)*).

    gadget for the world, you’ll need to develop the skills and knowledge necessary
    to build those projects. That’s why I’m constantly creating new learning material
    to help people bring their own ideas to life with electronics. To help people
    from all backgrounds develop these abilities, I’ve created a learning portal for
    electronics called Ohmify. It’s a place where you can sign up for courses to learn
    a variety of skills, including:'

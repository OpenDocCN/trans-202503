<div class="image1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/bfig00.jpg"/></div>
<p class="noindent">One of the challenges for locksport hobbyists is finding good sources for equipment. Some sellers will deal only with bona fide locksmiths, while others are happy to sell you gear, only for you to find out that it’s poorly made and not worth your money. To that end, we’re providing this appendix of trustworthy vendors and merchants that sell lockpicking hardware.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s worth noting that shops sometimes come and go, and others might ship only to a limited number of countries. Additionally, lockpickers each tend to have their own preferences, so what works for one person might not be great for another. Finally, not every tool from every vendor is great. Please don’t view this list as an endorsement, but rather as a guide if you’re having trouble finding the tools you need for locksport.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="lev117">Impressioning Tools</h3>
<p class="noindent">Several good places offer tools for impressioning:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bullet"><a href="http://LockPicks.com">LockPicks.com</a> states that it sells picking tools only to locksmiths, but it’ll sell other items, including impressioning grips, files, and key blanks, to everyone: <em><a href="https://www.lockpicks.com/locksmith-tools/impressioning-tools.html">https://www.lockpicks.com/locksmith-tools/impressioning-tools.html</a></em>.</li>
<li class="bullet">Foxhole Security sells a pocket-size impressioning handle and impressioning file: <em><a href="https://www.hooligankeys.com">https://www.hooligankeys.com</a></em>.</li>

<li class="bullet">The lightweight Pro-Lok handle can be found at <em><a href="https://www.pro-lok.com">https://www.pro-lok.com</a></em> and various resellers.</li>
<li class="bullet">For files, magnification solutions, and light sources, check jeweler’s supply stores like Cousins at <em><a href="https://www.cousinsuk.com">https://www.cousinsuk.com</a></em>.</li>
<li class="bullet"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_367"/>Manfrotto Super Clamps can be found at camera and theater stores like B&amp;H at <em><a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com">https://www.bhphotovideo.com</a></em>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">For measuring tools, any sliding calipers will do. Calipers with a dialed scale (mentioned in <a href="ch9.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>) can be bought from several sources. If you want to purchase Kroeplins, check out the vintage and secondhand market as well, as prices for mint units can be rather steep (eBay is also a good option).</p>
<p class="indent">The best tip for getting your hands on locks and blanks is “befriend a local locksmith.” Anyone running a key duplication service can also help with blanks. Keep in mind that they might use steel blanks as a default, so be precise in what you want to order.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev118">Safe Locks and Accessories</h3>
<p class="noindent">Ready to start manipulating safe locks? Try these sources:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bullet">MBA USA (<em><a href="https://mbausa.com">https://mbausa.com</a></em>) has locksmith-restricted items, but if you’re just purchasing locks and accessories, it’ll sell to you. Look for safe lock sales in October, when most retailers celebrate “Locktoberfest.” Often bulk buys are an affordable option. MBA also sells lock mounts (search <em>lock stand</em>). Be willing to pay a little extra for the models with the threaded inserts; they will survive many a lock swap-out and tightening.</li>
<li class="bullet">eBay, both in the US and several European countries, sells plenty of appropriate safe locks. Sourcing closer to home might save you some shipping costs and delays, however.</li>
<li class="bullet">Wendt, a large reseller out of Germany, sells safe locks and sometimes cutaway safe locks: <em><a href="https://www.zieh-fix.com/en">https://www.zieh-fix.com/en</a></em>.</li>
<li class="bullet">Amazon has plenty of retailers with locks for sale, but their premiums are often steep.</li>
<li class="bullet">Large security hardware wholesalers, such as IML Security Supply (<em><a href="https://www.IMLSS.com">https://www.IMLSS.com</a></em>), IDN (<em><a href="https://www.idn-inc.com">https://www.idn-inc.com</a></em>), and Lockmasters (<em><a href="https://www.lockmasters.com">https://www.lockmasters.com</a></em>), have numerous supplies but often require you to jump through some hoops to establish an account in order to purchase from them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev119">Lever Locks</h3>
<p class="noindent">Lever locks can be hard to find outside of the UK. One option is to search for UK marketplace sites with vendors that might ship globally, such as <a href="http://eBay.uk">eBay.uk</a>, <a href="http://Amazon.co.uk">Amazon.co.uk</a>, and Alibaba or AliExpress.</p>
<p class="indent">Alibaba also often has a few lever lock picks for sale, usually labeled as <em>locksmith tools</em>. However, their quality and utility is rather unpredictable, so you’re often better off making your own tools to fit your specific lock.</p>
<p class="indent">Some lever locks are commonly sold outside the UK, such as safe deposit box locks and keyed safe locks. However, neither option is great for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_368"/>beginners. Safe deposit box locks tend to be small and use smaller-than-average keyways and levers. This can make learning on them difficult.</p>
<p class="indent">While keyed safe locks use standard-size levers, they’re typically designed to be high-security locks, making them a challenge for even experienced lever lockpickers.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev120">Lock Maintenance Tools</h3>
<p class="noindent">If your locks need a tune-up or a repinning, these vendors sell to non-professionals:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bullet"><a href="http://LockPicks.com">LockPicks.com</a> will sell pins, key blanks, and repinning tools to hobbyists: <em><a href="https://www.lockpicks.com">https://www.lockpicks.com</a></em>.</li>
<li class="bullet">SPARROWS Lock Picks has pinning mats, plug followers, Gut Wrenches, pinning tweezers, and security pins: <em><a href="https://www.sparrowslockpicks.com">https://www.sparrowslockpicks.com</a></em>.</li>
<li class="bullet">Houdini Lock Lube spray can be found at <em><a href="http://www.houdinilocklube.com">http://www.houdinilocklube.com</a></em>.</li>
<li class="bullet">HUK’s 12 in 1 Lock Disassembly Tool kit is great for taking apart Euro profile cylinders. It can be found on merchant sites such as AliExpress or Banggood from various sellers, usually for about $25. The same kit often appears on eBay or Amazon, but at a significant markup.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev121">Miscellaneous Items</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here are some other places to get locksport-related gear we’ve mentioned in the book:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bullet">Handcuffs, handcuff keys, and shims can be found at Handcuff Warehouse: <em><a href="https://www.handcuffwarehouse.com">https://www.handcuffwarehouse.com</a></em>.</li>
<li class="bullet">The SPARROWS Lock Picks Stretcher tool is an excellent under-door tool: <em><a href="https://www.sparrowslockpicks.com/product_p/underdoor.htm">https://www.sparrowslockpicks.com/product_p/underdoor.htm</a></em>.</li>
<li class="bullet">Travel cases to get tools and locks safely to international competitions can be purchased from Pelican: <em><a href="https://www.pelican.com">https://www.pelican.com</a></em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev122">Other Books and Papers</h3>

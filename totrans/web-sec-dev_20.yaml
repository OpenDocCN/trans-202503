    source control and decide on a branching strategy. Separate configuration from
    code, so it is easy to build testing environments. Use a testing environment to
    validate functionality before each release. Automate the deployment of code to
    each environment. Make sure your release process is reliable, reproducible, and
    revertible. Always know which version of the code is running on each environment,
    and be able to roll back to a prior version in a simple fashion.

- en: If you’re working in security, chances are you’re using data science more than
    ever before, even if you may not realize it. For example, your antivirus product
    uses data science algorithms to detect malware. Your firewall vendor may have
    data science algorithms detecting suspicious network activity. Your security information
    and event management (SIEM) software probably uses data science to identify suspicious
    trends in your data. Whether conspicuously or not, the entire security industry
    is moving toward incorporating more data science into security products.

    learning algorithms into their workflows. For example, in recent conference presentations
    and news articles, security analysts at Target, Mastercard, and Wells Fargo all
    described developing custom data science technologies that they use as part of
    their security workflows.[¹](footnote.xhtml#introfn1) If you’re not already on
    the data science bandwagon, there’s no better time to upgrade your skills to include
    data science into your security practice.

- en: '*Data science* is a growing set of algorithmic tools that allow us to understand
    and make predictions about data using statistics, mathematics, and artful statistical
    data visualizations. More specific definitions exist, but generally, data science
    has three subcomponents: machine learning, data mining, and data visualization.'

- en: In the security context, machine learning algorithms learn from training data
    to detect new threats. These methods have been proven to detect malware that flies
    under the radar of traditional detection techniques like signatures. Data mining
    algorithms search security data for interesting patterns (such as relationships
    between threat actors) that might help us discern attack campaigns targeting our
    organizations. Finally, data visualization renders sterile, tabular data into
    graphical format to make it easier for people to spot interesting and suspicious
    trends. I cover all three areas in depth in this book and show you how to apply
    them.

- en: 'Data science is critically important for the future of cybersecurity for three
    reasons: first, security is *all about data*. When we seek to detect cyber threats,
    we’re analyzing data in the form of files, logs, network packets, and other artifacts.
    Traditionally, security professionals didn’t use data science techniques to make
    detections based on these data sources. Instead, they used file hashes, custom-written
    rules like signatures, and manually defined heuristics. Although these techniques
    have their merits, they required handcrafted techniques for each type of attack,
    necessitating too much manual work to keep up with the changing cyber threat landscape.
    In recent years, data science techniques have become crucial in bolstering our
    ability to detect threats.'

- en: Second, data science is important to cybersecurity because the number of cyberattacks
    on the internet has grown dramatically. Take the growth of the malware underworld
    as an example. In 2008, there were about 1 million unique malware executables
    known to the security community. By 2012, there were 100 million. As this book
    goes to press in 2018, there are more than 700 million malicious executables known
    to the security community (*[https://www.av-test.org/en/statistics/malware/](https://www.av-test.org/en/statistics/malware/)*),
    and this number is likely to grow.
  id: totrans-9
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Due to the sheer volume of malware, manual detection techniques such as signatures
    are no longer a reasonable method for detecting all cyberattacks. Because data
    science techniques automate much of the work that goes into detecting cyberattacks,
    and vastly decrease the memory usage needed to detect such attacks, they hold
    tremendous promise in defending networks and users as cyber threats grow.

- en: Finally, data science matters for security because data science is *the* technical
    trend of the decade, both inside and outside of the security industry, and it
    will likely remain so through the next decade. Indeed, you’ve probably seen applications
    of data science everywhere—in personal voice assistants (Amazon Echo, Siri, and
    Google Home), self-driving cars, ad recommendation systems, web search engines,
    medical image analysis systems, and fitness tracking apps.

    education, and other areas. Because data science has become a key enabler across
    the technical landscape, universities, major companies (Google, Facebook, Microsoft,
    and IBM), and governments are investing billions of dollars to improve data science
    tools. Thanks to these investments, data science tools will become even more adept
    at solving hard attack-detection problems.

- en: This book focuses on data science as it applies to *malware*, which we define
    as executable programs written with malicious intent, because malware continues
    to be the primary means by which threat actors gain a foothold on networks and
    subsequently achieve their goals. For example, in the ransomware scourge that
    has emerged in recent years, attackers typically send users malicious email attachments
    that download ransomware executables (malware) to users’ machines, which then
    encrypt users’ data and ask them for a ransom to decrypt the data. Although skilled
    attackers working for governments sometimes avoid using malware altogether to
    fly under the radar of detection systems, malware continues to be the major enabling
    technology in cyberattacks today.

    attempting to cover security data science broadly, this book aims to show more
    thoroughly how data science techniques can be applied to a major security problem.
    By understanding malware data science, you’ll be better equipped to apply data
    science to other areas of security, like detecting network attacks, phishing emails,
    or suspicious user behavior. Indeed, almost all the techniques you’ll learn in
    this book apply to building data science detection and intelligence systems in
    general, not just for malware.

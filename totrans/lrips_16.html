FUERZA, LOOKOUT HILL LIGHTHOUSE</em></span>. Laurie and Xor couldn’t see any lighthouse, but
there was a cloud of dust rising from the hill.</p><p>“You work for Winsome, eh? Right on time,” said Bruto when they arrived.
“I’m sorry to say we’re behind schedule. Our lighthouse isn’t finished.
We’ve been working double-time, day and night.”</p><p>“Are you going to put the lighthouse on top of that castle?” Laurie asked.</p><p>“Castle?” asked Bruto. “That <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> the
lighthouse.”</p><p>Dozens of Green-Shelled Round machines were busy all around the enormous structure. They
looked just like Tinker’s turtle, but they were the size of a large truck. Instead of drawing
dots on paper, these turtles were laying bricks on top of bricks, making WALLs, STAIRs, and WINDOWs
right before Laurie’s eyes.</p><p>“What are all those things coming out from the wall?” she asked, pointing to a
forest of supports and buttresses on one side of the tower.</p><p>“We’ve had no end of problems,” said Bruto, shaking his head and spitting.
“The south wall was falling outward. So we had to shore it up. Then it started falling
<span class="emphasis"><em>inward</em></span>.”</p><p>“Is that why you’re behind schedule?” she asked. There was something about
the scene that bothered Laurie, but she couldn’t put her finger on it. It looked . . .
messy.</p><p>“Things are always going wrong,” Bruto said. “Big ideas come with big risks.
But we can fix any problem with more power and hard work!”</p><p>“You certainly have a lot of both,” Laurie said, with just a teensy tiny bit of
envy. The things she could do with all those turtles! “How do you teach the turtles to build a
tower?”</p><p>“Here, let me show you.” Bruto led her to a tent nearby. A small army of people
was working around a table. “First we write the plans on paper.”</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="strong"><strong><span class="blue">BRICK-LINE</span>:</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Lay a brick,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>move forward,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>lay a brick,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>move forward,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>lay a brick,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>move forward,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>. . .</strong></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“That part makes a LINE of bricks.

and that’s how a wall gets built. To make the wall thicker, we just add more

“It must have taken forever to write all of this.”</p><p>“Big buildings need big plans. Big plans need big teams. It’s only logical,”
Bruto said. “Writing the plans wasn’t the worst part, though. We’re running out of
bricks!”</p><p>“Really? But why?”</p><p>“The first version wasn’t strong enough, and it fell down. So now I’m making
a tower twice as big, twice as thick, and twice as tall. Two times two times two is
eight.”</p><p>“So it needs eight times as many bricks?” Laurie asked.</p><p>“It’s just a matter of supplies.”</p><p>“How do you know this version of the plan will work?”</p><p>“We’re not a bunch of amateurs, girlie. We do extensive testing of our
algorithms,” Bruto said. “Take a look at this!” Off to the side was a table
covered with tiny turtles and tiny bricks.</p><p>“Hey, they’re building a tower, too!” Laurie exclaimed. Sure enough, the
turtles were following the same plan as their bigger cousins.</p><p>“We test new plans by building a scale model,” Bruto explained.</p><p>“But, Bruto, the model doesn’t have the same extra stuff keeping the walls from
falling down.”</p><p>“Some problems only show up in the full size. When that happens, we have to
adapt.”</p><p>“Oh,” Laurie said. “But if the model is not the same as the real thing, how
can you be sure that—”</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00042a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00042"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="figs/web/116fig01.png.jpg"/></div></div><p>They turned around just in time to see the full-size tower collapse into a big pile of bricks.
Bruto stood still for a long time, watching the dust settle as the turtles got to work cleaning up
the mess.</p><p>“Are you going to make it even bigger now?” Laurie asked.</p><p>“No. What we need . . . what we need . . . is a radical change of plan! All right,
everyone,” Bruto said to no one in particular. “Clear the decks! Empty your minds!
Brainstorm! I want new ideas!”</p><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>Let’s make the walls four times as thick, but the tower only three
times as high</em></span>,” said one worker.</p><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>More supports inside and out!</em></span>” shouted another.</p><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>Use bigger bricks!</em></span>”</p><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>Make bricks out of steel!</em></span>”</p><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>Steel is too expensive. How about iron?</em></span>”</p><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>Are you crazy? Iron will rust!</em></span>”</p><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>I told you we should have used a triangle.</em></span>”</p><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>Make the outside steel, but the inside brick.</em></span>”</p><p>“Good! This is good! Keep them coming. We’re thinking outside the box. Anyone
else?” Bruto asked.</p><p>“Why not a circle, like the lighthouse on Abstract Island?” Laurie suggested. She
thought about it for a minute, then wrote out a pair of little poems.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="strong"><strong><span class="blue">BRICK-CIRCLE</span>:</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Lay a brick,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>turn right one degree,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>move forward,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>repeat three hundred sixty times.</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong><span class="blue">TOWER-CIRCLE</span> (<span class="red">how-high?</span>):</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Make a <span class="blue">BRICK-CIRCLE</span>,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>repeat <span class="red">how-high?</span>
times.</strong></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“See? You make a circle of bricks, then put a circle on top of that, all the way to the
top!” Laurie explained.</p><p>“Ha ha ha, cute idea, girlie! But that can’t possibly work,” Bruto
replied.</p><p>“Why not?” Laurie asked.</p><p>“It’s too small!” Bruto said. “How do you expect to make a great big
tower out of a teeny little plan like this?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Laurie said. It seemed sensible to her, but maybe they knew
something she didn’t. They were professionals, after all. “I . . . I think it will
work.”</p><p>“Hmph,” Bruto hmphed. “Even if it were big enough, it has a major
flaw.”</p><p>“What flaw?”</p><p>“Our first plan was a hollow square, and it fell down,” Bruto said. “The
second plan was a hollow square, twice as big, and it also fell down. Your plan is a hollow
circle.”</p><p>“I don’t understand. Shouldn’t a circle be stronger?”</p><p>“Obviously, the problem isn’t shape or size—the problem is that they are
<span class="emphasis"><em>hollow inside</em></span>!” said Bruto. “We need to fill up the insides with
brick, too. It’s only logical.”</p><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>You’re right, Bruto!</em></span>” said one worker.</p><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>That’s why you’re the boss</em></span>,” said
another.</p><p>“But I’ve seen hollow towers,” said Laurie. “They’ve been built
before.”</p><p>“How do you know they won’t fall down eventually? The evidence is very
clear,” said Bruto.</p><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>Yes, very clear</em></span>,” the other workers agreed, nodding to each
other.</p><p>“But I—”</p><p>“No, I’ve made up my mind,” Bruto said. “The tower must be solid. In
fact,” he said, looking at the pile, “we’re going to build a
pyramid.”</p><p>“A pyramid?!”</p><p>“A pyramid can’t fall down. It’s already fallen down,” explained
Bruto. “It’s one of the perfect solids!”</p><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>Yes, that’s right!</em></span>” agreed one worker.</p><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>Genius!</em></span>”</p><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>It’s just a matter of more work and more
materials.</em></span>”</p><p>“Okay! We have a plan,” said Bruto. “Everyone, let’s get to work! Send
Winsome my apologies, girlie, and tell her that we need more time to get it right.”</p><p>Some people can’t be argued with. As Laurie and Xor set out for the
<span class="emphasis"><em>Doppelganger</em></span>, Bruto and his team were busy writing out the instructions for his
PYRAMID, brick by brick by brick.</p></div></body></html>

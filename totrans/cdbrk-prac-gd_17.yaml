    the main concepts we’ve explained, you have learned a lot about codebreaking.
    You’re a considerable way along the path to becoming a skilled cryptanalyst. However,
    there is still a good deal more you can learn, and there are many more crypto
    challenges waiting to be solved. In the following sections, we will tell you how
    you can proceed on your codebreaking journey from here.

    ciphers ([Chapter 6](c06.xhtml)). Here are some more. Unlike the ones we have
    covered so far, these cryptograms cannot be assigned to a certain cipher type

    was quite common in World War II, and the British Royal Air Force trained about
    250,000 birds for this purpose. Typically, they dropped the pigeons into Nazi-occupied
    Europe, using parachutes. Agents picked them up and provided them to the British
    military for sending messages back home.

    kind of encryption was used for this message. Numerous codebreakers have tried
    to decipher it, without any luck. Some have suggested that the cipher used was
    a one-time pad (see [Chapter 8](c08.xhtml)), which would mean that the message

- en: The squircle cryptogram consists of 260 characters but too few distinct symbols
    or even digraphs to encode twenty-six letters. Therefore, our guess is that Kohlhagen
    used tetragraphs (i.e., groups of four characters). A single tetragraph, with
    a range of 0000 to 3333, could represent 256 possible numbers. This is an ideal
    amount for encoding ASCII characters, including upper and lowercase letters, numbers,
    punctuation symbols, and so forth. The ciphertext message on the pillar consists
    of sixty-five tetragraphs, meaning that (if we are right) it could potentially
    lead to a plaintext of sixty-five ASCII characters.

    cryptogram includes a path transposition similar to the ones used for the other
    challenges. As all other known paths are based on a grid of single characters,
    independently of whether the cryptographic system uses digraphs or tetragraphs,
    one might have to form the tetragraphs after performing the transposition. Of
    course, the reverse could be true, as well!

    breaking classical ciphers using both manual and computer-based methods. We believe
    our book is unique in that it is oriented toward the most frequent classical ciphers
    encountered in practice and introduces many genuine solved and unsolved cryptograms.
    We are not aware of another book with a similar scope, but of course, there are
    many other fine codebreaking books on the market.

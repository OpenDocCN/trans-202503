    you’ve explored, is possible for the same reason: manufacturing tolerances. When
    the lock is made, the levers are stamped out from multiple tools to give the variations
    of lift, so the levers aren’t *exactly* the same size, and the stump can’t be
    perfectly aligned. When you tension the lock, the longest lever will be caught
    by the stump first. This will keep the bolt from traveling farther back and hold
    the lever in place. When you move that one binding lever, the next binds up, and
    so on, until, with any luck, the lock opens.'

    it is the balance of tensioner rotational force to drive the bolt back and the
    resulting holding force applied to the levers. The concept is similar to pin tumbler
    lockpicking: if you don’t apply enough tension, nothing will bind, the lock will
    keep resetting, and you’ll never open it. If you apply too much tension, everything
    will jam up so that you won’t be able to manipulate the working parts. With the
    right amount of tension, however, one lever should bind up enough that you notice
    it and can hold it in place while moving the picking tool to another location.'

    levers into position and probe them to get feedback. Nudge, don’t fire, the levers—if
    they bind too hard, you’ll lose control over them.

    out its location comes with experience. The lever pack can be anywhere, but generally
    it’s next to the bolt, inside the keyway. What you’re feeling for is the solid
    contact of the bolt and the springy or “clattering” movement of the levers.

    is facing to the left, with the levers above the keyway and in front of the bolt,
    as shown in the photos throughout this section. Keep in mind that if the bolt
    is *right facing*, the levers are now behind the bolt. In that case, you’d reverse
    your tools: using the picking tool to tension in the opposite rotation, and using
    the tensioner to pick.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Usually, the side with the bolt facing left is easier. I’m not entirely sure
    why; the bolt lath making the levers a few millimeters farther away surely has
    a negligible effect. Possibly it’s because most people practice that more frequently.
    On all lever padlocks I know of, you also pick as if the bolt were facing left,
    because internally it is. Likewise on 95 percent of safe locks, although they
    can be mounted such that the bolt points vertically as well (a few old ones out
    there, I suspect, are also right facing). You can reverse any double-sided lock
    for the challenge of picking “right facing” if you wish.

    recall ever seeing one outside the books before. Though fairly responsive, the
    lock would go only so far from the “outside”—that is, with the bolt facing to
    the right. Yes, it was a little worn, but it was also very “gritty” and very hard
    to turn back the curtain to reset the lock. After almost an hour, I gave up and
    walked to the other side of the door to try it “left facing.” Just a couple of
    minutes later, it gave up the fight.

    good practice. Nearly all British Standard curtained lever locks have five levers.
    Make sure you have free and full movement under the lever pack; that is, ensure
    you can get from the front of the lock case to the back, reaching every lever,

    a little to get clearance for the picking tool. You won’t need to do this with
    the 2-in-1/Hobbs-type picks, as they rotate like a key. As long as you rotate
    these picks back far enough toward the keyhole, you’ll clear the lever pack and/or
    bolt and can move freely back up under the lever of your choice.

    are all the same. If not, odds are high that a lever with a longer belly requires
    a higher lift, and one with a shorter belly requires a lower lift, or vice versa—there’s
    information there, and you just have to determine which way around it is! (In
    many high-security-rated locks, all the bellies are identical to prevent you from
    using this trick. Indeed, some standards insist on it.)

    tool. Nudge the lever to see whether it moves freely and returns under spring
    pressure (where applicable—if the tool you’re using takes off the spring pressure,
    this won’t apply until you reset the lock). Also check whether the lever returns
    loosely under gravity or returns when driven in the opposite direction. A bound
    lever, like a bound pin, won’t move freely.
  prefs: []

- en: If the lever is tightly bound, excessive pressure from the stump means you won’t
    be able to move it easily either. When you apply sufficient picking force to overcome
    the binding force, the energy stored in the natural spring of the picking tool
    will “fire” the lever upward, like a rubber band flicked across the room. This
    often pushes the lever past the gate to its maximum height, but there’s no way
    to know whether you have then *overlifted* it (gone too far and blocked the stump).
    If you have, it’s game over; you can never deliberately reset a chosen lever on
    a single-bitted key lock.

    the lever might be such that it simply stopped binding. (Some locks, such as the

    repeated lifts, as they bind, then stop binding when lifted slightly. See [Figure
    15-21](ch15.xhtml#ch15fig21).) When released, the lever drops back to almost exactly
    where it started, and the bolt moves imperceptibly. Lift the next binding lever,
    and the bolt moves imperceptibly again, and that lever also returns almost to
    its original position.

    on some locks by *compressing the pack*: pulling the entire pack of levers together,
    pinching them with the tensioner, and effectively jamming them against the lock
    case and their neighboring levers. If you compress them too hard, the entire pack
    could move as one, or just the target lever and the adjacent one(s). If you pull
    too gently, the entire pack, or individual levers, could drop and reset when you
    reduce the tension.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As with the more usual tensioning method, this technique requires a proper balance.
    Not only that, but it doesn’t work the same on all locks. In some locks with stamped
    steel levers and no spacers, like the StrongBOLT shown in [Figure 16-1](ch16.xhtml#ch16fig1),
    compressing the pack can cause the levers to move into the empty spaces between
    them or to bind into the space where two stamped bumps meet, locking the levers
    together. Compressing the pack for center bolt locks with levers on either side
    produces different results as well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A true gate is generally larger than a false gate. Therefore, when compressing
    the pack, you might be able to feel out the locations of the false and true gates,
    based on the feedback such as a lever slapping or a lack of resistance from a
    lever rubbing on the stump, even if you can’t get the levers to stay quite where
    you want just yet. Mentally note these gate locations for later in the picking
    process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On single-spring locks with double-bitted keys, there’s simply no way to move
    just a single lever reliably, even without pack compression. These levers are
    very light and free to pivot, so they’ll shift whenever a neighbor is disturbed.
    Fortunately, you can always push the lever up or down in a double-bitted lock,
    so record or remember your positions, and then dial them back to where they should
    be, and you’ll be one step closer to your open.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, note that tilting your tensioner will have much the same effect as
    compressing the pack. This is fine if you’re doing it intentionally, but if you
    aren’t, then you’ll be making the task more difficult for yourself, as the feedback
    you get will be altered. Remember to keep your picking tools in the correct place—perpendicular
    to the lock.

    move back slightly into the V, and the lever will stop binding. As you find other
    binding levers and set them, this one will start binding again as the stump moves
    farther into the V, slowing you down. When you lift this early binding lever higher,
    the V notch will force the stump, bolt, and tensioner backward, probably releasing
    some unknown other levers at the same time. Annoying! This is, of course, the
    role of an antipick: to frustrate the lockpicker and slow them down.'

    it before to go right past the false gate and reach the true gate, or at least

    the true gate. It may help to try to compress the lever pack (by pulling the tensioner
    back toward you) as you do this, to slow or stall the other levers dropping back
    to rest. Just don’t throw it too high, or you might well be stuck again.

- en: A picker, of course, can easily use this information to their benefit by decoding
    with the wire and then lifting straight to the area of interest. In the case of
    an ABACD lock, you’d go, perhaps, high, medium, high, medium, low with your lifts,
    rather than picking purely with feedback, which could help you avoid antipicks
    and mapping out the lock by feel.

    with antipicks above the true gate, and compare them to those with antipicks below
    the true gate. A grouping emerges, with those stamped 1 through 4 in one group,
    and 5 through 8 in the other (not all are pictured).

    You can see how the lever bellies betray the lift; the low lift has a smaller
    radius than the high. To increase the picking difficulty and available key differs,
    the front edge of the lever gate is narrow, while the back is widened to prevent
    jamming.

    of the levers to defeat this simple way of decoding, making it harder to find
    out. See the Asec/Legge with vertically sliding levers, shown in [Figure 16-8](ch16.xhtml#ch16fig8);
    and the Mauer 76000 series and the S&G FAS 69x0 series are other examples. Manufacturers
    might also restrict the rotation of the curtain to prevent easy access to the
    levers, leaving the fronts of the levers all the same, with the only variation
    being at a steep angle through the curtain (examples include the UNION StrongBOLT
    and ERA Fortress). In that case, the lock’s levers can sometimes then be decoded
    from the heel.

    can see the reduced contact lever bellies that slide vertically. A wire picking
    tool of a standard length will miss the details required to decode, making the
    task harder. Early models had full-width bellies and were easily read with a wire.

    the tendency of the wire to get trapped by the front edge of the cutaway lever
    toe as it rotates.

- en: Other decoding methods, including *optical* (use of a camera, endoscope, or
    tiny mirror on a stick), *wire* (poking one or more wires in and gauging rotations),
    or alternate impressioning techniques (using plasticine or putty to impression
    the key) may or may not be allowed in competition settings. You’ll have to ask
    and should expect a no. You can often decode the toe or heel of the levers by
    using the same double-bend picking wire or 2-in-1 tool you use for the actual
    picking. You’ll need to practice this on a few target locks beforehand if you
    want exact results.

- en: However, simply knowing that the first lever is a high lift because the pick
    rotates much farther before it hits the lever—as compared to the second lever
    you test, which has barely any rotation—gives you a big clue before you even start
    picking. You’ll need to know your lock in advance, though; as explained earlier,
    some are the reverse orientation, and others have identical bellies throughout.

    contest, decoding kits and endoscopes are likely fine, as they are equipment the
    locksmith owns already, and the goal is to open the lock neatly, not to get the
    best time. Many other decoding techniques can be used, but we’ve already strayed
    far enough from the subject of this chapter!

    Hopefully, you’ve seen that once you have some experience under your belt, the
    process isn’t as daunting as it might have seemed initially. Getting ahold of
    the locks and hardware will likely be your biggest challenge (your first ports
    of call should be friendly locksmiths or thrift and antique stores for locks,
    and hobby shops for piano wire).

<span class="ChapterTitle">Decisions, Decisions</span></h1>
</header>
<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">A</span> good team makes good decisions. Solid technology and business decisions helped propel Android toward a successful launch and ensuing growth as it was able to realize its potential with manufacturers, developers, and users.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c49-0001">The Tech—Features that Found Fans </h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Most of Android’s technology was just fundamental tech that any smartphone required: a device with data and wireless capabilities, plus standard applications like a browser, email, maps, and messaging applications. These features weren’t factors in Android’s growth; they were more like checkbox items that had to be there for the platform to even be relevant.</p>
<p>But other pieces of technology were unique to Android, which helped create a loyal fan base of both developers and users. They were features built into the platform from the start that distinguished Android from the other smartphone platforms.</p>
<ol class="none">
<li><span class="RunInHead">Notifications </span>  The system of notifications on Android helped bring the whole system together, as applications cooperated with the underlying system to propagate information to the user about things that they wanted to know about.</li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">Multitasking </span>  Allowing users to easily and quickly switch between applications with UI elements like the Back and Recents buttons foresaw the new dynamic of mobile computing where people constantly use several apps to get things done.</li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">Security </span>  From the beginning, the team realized that mobile apps were fundamentally different from desktop apps, and built a system <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_362" title="362"/>that isolated applications from each other. Security has only become more important over the years, but Android provided the fundamentals from the start, all the way down to the lowest layers of the kernel and the hardware.</li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">Size matters </span>  The team enabled applications to scale to different screen sizes and densities, which proved critical in enabling all kinds of devices and sizes, where applications would work just as well.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="h1-502680c49-0002">The Tools—Creating an App Ecosystem </h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">In the days before the iPhone and Android, third-party applications for mobile devices did exist. But apps weren’t really the reason why people bought their phones, and they didn’t dominate users’ time on their devices. Instead, the phones came with built-in applications that handled most of their needs: they could talk on the phone, check email, message, and maybe browse the web (in a limited way).</p>
<p>But once people started using smartphones, they could do so much more, and wanted so much more than device companies could provide in their own apps. So while the Google-provided Gmail, Maps, browser, and messaging apps were all very important on the early Android system, it was even more important for Android to open the door to <em>external</em> developers. Android allowed developers to write and provide their own applications, helping to create a rich ecosystem for users to be able to do much more than they ever could with just the apps that Google provided.</p>
<p>Enabling this app ecosystem was critical to the platform; any platform trying to enter the market now that doesn’t offer a rich selection of apps simply doesn’t have a chance. The team provided developers with a rich toolbox of capabilities that enabled these applications, and the entire application ecosystem, to exist.</p>
<ol class="none">
<li><span class="RunInHead">Language </span>  The choice of the Java programming language enabled new Android developers to bring existing skills over to this new platform.</li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">APIs </span>  Android was written from the beginning to be a platform for all developers, not just for the Android team. Offering public APIs for these developers to access core system functionality was critical for enabling powerful applications.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_363" title="363"/><span class="RunInHead">The SDK</span>  APIs alone would have made application development possible . . . but difficult. With the addition of documentation, an IDE, and a myriad of specialized tools for programmers, Android application development became possible for a large audience of developers anxious to create their own applications.</li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">Android Market</span>  Creating a centralized destination for developers to sell their applications, and for users to find a large and growing set of apps, jump-started the huge ecosystem of apps that everyone uses today.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="h1-502680c49-0003">The Business—Creating a Device Ecosystem</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">From the beginning, Android was intended to be an open platform that other companies could use to build their own products, not just a system for building a Google phone. A few key decisions and initiatives allowed this aspect of Android to achieve wide industry adoption.</p>
<ol class="none">
<li><span class="RunInHead">Open source </span>  Prior to Android, the only options that device manufacturers had were either building a platform themselves, licensing one for a significant cost, or cobbling something together from existing, but incomplete, solutions. Android provided a powerful, free, and open option for manufacturers that desperately needed it.</li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">Open Handset Alliance</span>  Bringing together the group of partner companies to form the OHA provided a single vision of what Android needed to be for the entire ecosystem. In the beginning, there were not even any Android users, much less devices, so having all of these competing interests and companies come together to support the shared vision was important in establishing the future that they were all hoping would come to pass.</li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">Compatibility</span>  One of the key elements to make Android work across a diverse ecosystem was compatibility of implementations, ensuring that developers could write apps that worked everywhere, instead of having to rewrite them for the plethora of available devices. To solve this problem, the Android team provided the Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) for manufacturers to ensure that they are providing a compatible implementation on every new device.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_364" title="364"/><span class="RunInHead">Partnerships</span>  Establishing relationships with a diverse set of partners and bringing them all into the Android community was crucial. It’s one thing to offer a platform. But manufacturers need help getting that platform working well on their devices in order to establish the momentum that Android needed to succeed. The Android team worked closely with partners to get the platform working well on new devices, building up a pipeline of devices for the market, establishing a large market of Android phones from manufacturers across the world.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="h1-502680c49-0004">The Acquisition—Building on a Solid Foundation</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">When Android was a fledgling startup, they had a choice: to continue to be independent, with venture funding they had secured, or to join Google. They opted to join Google, deciding that they had a better chance of achieving their vision for Android within that larger company than they could have on their own.</p>
<p>The fact that Android was developed inside of Google was undoubtedly an important factor in its growth. For one thing, Google had deep pockets, which made funding easier, including purchasing technology when it made more sense than building it from scratch. But Android’s achievements were due to more than just having access to Google’s money and resources. After all, many other large and successful companies did not fare as well with their mobile efforts during the same time period.</p>
<p>One of the aspects that worked for Android at Google was autonomy. Keeping themselves separate from the rest of the company gave the team that startup dynamic that they felt Android needed in those early days to ship the first product. At the same time, being a part of Google gave Android more leverage with partner companies than it would have had as an actual startup company. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Google had exactly the right kind of existing technical infrastructure that Android needed as it grew. Not only did the services team have the right experience to connect the Google apps to backend servers, but the team also had the advantage of relying on an infrastructure that could scale to their needs. A company that could handle the extreme download requirements of YouTube was able to deal with OTA updates for the small but growing base of Android users.</p>

<p class="TNI2">In this chapter, you’ll learn the basics of malware analysis, which, along with the next chapter, should give you a solid foundation for learning everything in the rest of this book. We’ll begin by walking through the malware analysis process, starting with initial triage of suspicious files. Then, we’ll dig into automated analysis in a sandbox environment, before wrapping up with a discussion of behavioral analysis in a virtual machine. As we progress through the chapter, I’ll point out areas in the malware triage and behavioral-analysis process that are especially relevant to investigating evasive malware. I’ll be focusing mostly on Windows executable files in this chapter and throughout this book.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_20" aria-label="20"/>As I noted in the <span class="Xref">introduction</span>, this book assumes you already have at least a beginner’s knowledge of malware analysis. This chapter therefore provides only the basic information required to quickly get you up to speed, and it skims over concepts that will be discussed in more detail in later chapters. I’ll point you to those chapters where appropriate.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Let’s get into it, starting with the importance of the analysis environment.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec1">&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec1"><span id="h-25"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">The Analysis Environment</samp></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI1">Building a safe and effective analysis environment is critical for successful malware analysis. You should put some thought into your analysis environment and tailor it to your needs. Malware analysts and researchers often use virtual machines and sandboxes, which offer a controlled environment in which to monitor the malware’s behavior. As a result, malware is increasingly using virtual machine and sandbox detection and circumvention techniques.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Before we go further, it’s important to establish some definitions. A <i>virtual machine (VM)</i> emulates a physical computer but runs entirely within an application known as a <i>hypervisor</i>. The hypervisor provides a sort of container that allows safe execution of malicious code and safe detonation of malware. A <i>malware analysis sandbox</i> is typically (but not always) a type of VM that is configured to automatically analyze malware and produce a report or assessment of the malware’s behaviors, capabilities, and properties. Some examples of sandboxes are the open source sandbox Cuckoo and the proprietary sandboxes Joe Sandbox and Any.Run. The main point here is that nearly all malware sandboxes are VMs, but not every VM is configured to be a malware sandbox.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">A typical malware analysis lab environment often consists of a host system and one or more VMs and sandboxes. The host system stores and runs the analysis VMs and sandboxes, and it may have Windows, Linux, or macOS as well as a hypervisor installed. The operating system and software configured on the VMs and sandboxes depend on the type of malware the analyst is investigating. For Windows malware analysis, for example, the analyst might have VMs running Windows 7, Windows 10, and Windows 11, as well as many specialized malware analysis tools.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec2"><span id="h-26"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">The Malware Analysis Process</samp></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI1">Imagine that you’re a malware analyst and you’re given an unknown file to investigate. This file could have no additional context, or it could be part of <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_21" aria-label="21"/>a larger breach and an ongoing incident response investigation. Either way, you must answer the following questions:</p>&#13;
<ul class="ul">&#13;
<li class="BL">What type of file is this?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">When the file is opened, what does it do?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Upon execution, what types of artifacts does the file create?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Does the executed file attempt to connect to the internet or communicate on the local network? If so, to which IP addresses or domains?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Does the executed file exhibit signs of potential malicious activity, such as hiding itself on the infected system, attempting to steal sensitive data, or attempting to detect malware analysis tools?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">If this file is malicious in nature, what are its capabilities and intentions?</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">These are questions that a good malware analysis process will help you answer. The exact process can differ from analyst to analyst, however. Expert analysts may deviate quite a bit from the many documented malware analysis processes, while beginner analysts might prefer to stick with a clear path. Most published malware analysis processes boil down to the same thing: start with the basics and slowly add in more advanced techniques as needed. For the remainder of this chapter, I’ll discuss the first stages of malware analysis, or malware triage, followed by manual behavioral analysis. In the next chapter, I’ll dive into the later stages of the malware analysis process.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec3"><span id="h-27"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Initial Malware Triage</samp></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI1">The word <i>triage</i> originates from the field of medicine, where patients are assessed (triaged) when there aren’t enough resources to treat all of them simultaneously. Patients with severe wounds are treated first, while those with minor scrapes and bruises can be treated later. Triaging malware is a similar concept. When faced with several different pieces of malware to investigate (during an incident, for example), an analyst must first triage the files to get an initial assessment of their behaviors before choosing which sample to investigate first.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">There are several objectives when it comes to initial triage. First, you need to determine what type of file you’re dealing with. Is it a Microsoft Excel document? A PDF? A script? An executable? The answer informs the rest of the malware analysis process. Second, you need to obtain as much information about the file as possible. For example, is the file known to public malware repositories and other researchers? This will help drive the third objective, which is to determine whether the file is malicious, and if so, what class of malware it is. Ransomware? Infostealer? Finally, you should have a basic understanding of the file’s capabilities. One of the primary objectives of initial triage is to help you determine your next steps in investigating the malware sample.</p>&#13;

<p class="TNI1">One of the most basic but important steps of malware analysis is identifying the file type, which will inform how you’ll approach your analysis, the tools you’ll use, and the order of the steps you’ll take. A file’s type is signified by its <i>magic bytes</i> or <i>signature</i>, one or more bytes of data at the beginning of the file. You can view the magic bytes in a hex editor such as McAfee FileInsight. The file shown in <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-1">Figure 2-1</a> has the magic bytes <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">4D 5A</samp> (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">MZ</samp> in ASCII), which is common for PE files.</p>&#13;

<p class="TX">In addition to a hex editor, you can use the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">file</samp> command to identify the file type in Linux. This tool reads the file’s signature and displays it in a human-readable format. Simply run the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W7Bold_B_11">file</samp> command with the malware file as an input parameter:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre-2"><code><span class="TheSansMonoCd_W7Bold_B_11">&gt; file suspicious.exe</span></code></pre>&#13;
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_23" aria-label="23"/>As you can see in the output shown here, this file is indeed an executable, specifically a Windows 32-bit PE file:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre-3"><code>remnux@remnux:~$ file suspicious.exe&#13;

<p class="TX">The <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">file</samp> command is a good general-purpose tool for identifying many common file formats, including non-PE files such as documents and archives. For PE files specifically, PE static analysis tools, or what I call <i>PE triage tools</i>, can come in handy. CFF Explorer (<a href="https://ntcore.com"><i>https://<wbr/>ntcore<wbr/>.com</i></a>), for example, is a great initial analysis tool because it provides information such as file size and file creation timestamps, some of which you can see in <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-2">Figure 2-2</a>.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec5"><span id="h-29"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_I_11">Obtaining the File’s Hash</samp></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI1">A file’s <i>hash</i> is a sort of fingerprint in that it is unique to that file. When a file is run through a hashing algorithm, the algorithm generates a fixed-size sequence of characters. The exact size depends on which hashing algorithm is used. The most common file-hashing algorithms used for malware analysis are MD5, SHA-1, and (the most recent and reliable of the three) SHA256.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">In <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-3">Figure 2-3</a>, the file’s MD5 hash is <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">C37CFC5C7EFD645BEE48ED745EC12906</samp> and its SHA-1 hash is <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">D2DD576536813A87CDC00E87FAC65DA75FB36A0F</samp>. These hash values <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_24" aria-label="24"/>uniquely identify this file. Note that MD5 is an older algorithm, but it’s still in use today. MD5 and SHA-1 have a risk of <i>collisions</i>, meaning that two or more files could have the same hash value; this is very rare, but it still happens. We won’t go into hash collisions here; suffice to say, if you spot two completely different files with the same signature, you likely have encountered a collision.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Once you’ve obtained the file’s hash, you can use it to get additional information about the file from other sources. Let’s look at how that works.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec6"><span id="h-30"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_I_11">Triaging with VirusTotal</samp></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI1">VirusTotal (<a href="https://www.virustotal.com"><i>https://<wbr/>www<wbr/>.virustotal<wbr/>.com</i></a>) is a publicly available platform for malware triage and analysis. No account is required, so anyone can upload files to get a quick assessment. VirusTotal runs the uploaded file against 60+ anti-malware software vendors to get the overall detection rate of the file, runs the file in a sandbox environment (which we’ll discuss shortly), and retrieves additional information on the file from multiple sources. A typical VirusTotal assessment can include the following:</p>&#13;
<ul class="ul">&#13;
<li class="BL">The number of anti-malware detections for the file (the <i>detection rate</i>)</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Sandbox reports from the file</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">The file’s metadata (file creator, creation date, and so on)</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Digital certificates associated with the file</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Yara rule matches (we’ll discuss Yara later in this chapter)</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Many other useful pieces of information</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">One key advantage of VirusTotal is its ability to query the very large malware database for a hash. You can simply paste the hash into VirusTotal, and it will run a passive query for the file, providing all the information as if you’d uploaded the file yourself. As long as the file is in the database, VirusTotal will provide a report on it. Running the SHA-1 hash for our malware file from <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-2">Figure 2-2</a> (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">D2DD576536813A87CDC00E87FAC65DA75FB36A0F</samp>) returns the report shown in <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-3">Figure 2-3</a>.</p>&#13;

</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_25" aria-label="25"/>You can see that this file has a detection rate of 56/68, meaning that 56 out of 68 anti-malware software vendors classify this file as malicious. From this information, we can conclude that the file is highly likely to be malware. In addition to the file’s detection rate, some vendors include the malware’s class and family name. Based on the report, we can make an educated guess that the malware family is potentially <i>Ave Maria</i>, a common variant of remote access trojan and infostealer. Note, however, that the malware classifications from VirusTotal aren’t always correct. The malware file may be packed, leading to a false classification. <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter17.xhtml">Chapter 17</a></span> will discuss packing in great detail.</p>&#13;

<p class="NOTE-TXT"><i>Querying VirusTotal for a file hash is always a good idea. But before actually uploading a file there, you should consider the risks of the file being publicly available on the VirusTotal platform. Ask yourself: Does this file contain sensitive information, such as data about me or my company? Is this file part of an active investigation involving my company? Will uploading this file alert the malware authors that their malware was discovered and is being actively analyzed? Remember, malicious actors are watching VirusTotal too.</i></p>&#13;

<p class="TX">It looks like we have a match! The line that begins with <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">AveMaria</samp> shows us that there was a successful match, and the lines following it show exactly which strings from the rule matched on our suspicious file.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Yara rules can help you quickly obtain valuable information about the file you’re dealing with and potentially even identify its associated malware family. For more information on Yara, see <a href="https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/stable/"><i>https://<wbr/>yara<wbr/>.readthedocs<wbr/>.io<wbr/>/en<wbr/>/stable<wbr/>/</i></a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Now, let’s take a look at how to assess an unknown file based on its static properties.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec9">&#13;
&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec9"><span id="h-33"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_I_11">Analyzing Static Properties</samp></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI1">You can learn a lot about an unknown file by inspecting its static properties. Some of these properties were discussed in <span class="Xref">“The PE File Format”</span> on <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter1.xhtml#pg_13">page 13</a></span>.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec10">&#13;
&#13;
<h5 class="H3" id="sec10"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Strings</samp></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI1"><i>Strings</i> are sequences of characters in various file types. Sometimes strings are human-readable text, and sometimes they’re simply a sequence of bytes. Either way, they can be a great starting point for inspecting an unknown file. The simplest way to extract strings from a file is to use the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">strings</samp> command line tool in Linux. This tool scans the file and attempts to locate and interpret strings of binary data into human-readable form:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre-7"><code>&gt; <b>strings suspicious.exe</b></code></pre>&#13;
<p class="TX">Note that by default, the strings command will only output ASCII strings. Another type of string, unicode (or wide), can be extracted by using the following command: <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">strings -e l suspicious.exe</samp>. The output already reveals some interesting things:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre-8"><code>remnux@remnux:/malware$ <b>strings suspicious.exe</b>&#13;
<var>--snip--</var>&#13;
127.0.0.2&#13;
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJK... &#13;
warzone160&#13;
<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_28" aria-label="28"/>.bss&#13;
USER32.DLL&#13;
MessageBoxA&#13;
Assert&#13;
An assertion condition failed&#13;
PureCall&#13;
<var>--snip--</var></code></pre>&#13;
<p class="TX">Most notably, there’s a reference to <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">warzone160</samp>. Running a quick search engine query reveals that this is very likely related to the Ave Maria or Warzone RAT malware family, as you can see in <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-5">Figure 2-5</a>. This is a good example of integrating open source intelligence (OSINT) into your malware analysis process.</p>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img class="img80" id="fig2-5" src="../images/fig2-5.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 2-5: An OSINT investigation for embedded strings in malware</samp></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">For executable files specifically, PE tools such as PEStudio can be very useful. PEStudio not only extracts various string formats from the executable but also orders and classifies those strings based on certain characteristics, as you can see in <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-6">Figure 2-6</a>.</p>&#13;
<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_29" aria-label="29"/>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img class="img100" id="fig2-6" src="../images/fig2-6.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 2-6: String classification in PEStudio</samp></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">PEStudio has discovered several notable strings: possible privilege escalation capabilities (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Elevation:Administrator</samp>), a command line command (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">cmd.exe</samp>) and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">powershell</samp> and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">wmic</samp> references, as well as references to SMTP services and passwords (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">SMTP</samp>, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">POP</samp>, and so on). From these strings, you might infer that this file has capabilities to elevate its privileges from a standard user to an administrator; invoke Windows tools such as <i>cmd.exe</i>, PowerShell, and WMIC; and use SMTP for network communication. The useful pieces of information you discover in strings can help guide you during your investigation, giving you clues about a malware file’s intentions.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Two additional tools that are very useful for string analysis are FLOSS and StringSifter. FLOSS (<a href="https://github.com/mandiant/flare-floss"><i>https://<wbr/>github<wbr/>.com<wbr/>/mandiant<wbr/>/flare<wbr/>-floss</i></a>) is a tool for identifying and extracting <i>obfuscated</i> strings—that is, strings that are being intentionally obscured to prevent prying eyes from viewing the data. Here’s an excerpt of FLOSS’s output for a different suspect file:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre-9"><code>remnux@remnux:~$ <b>floss unknown.exe</b>&#13;
<var>--snip--</var>&#13;
FLOSS decoded 29 strings&#13;
<var>--snip--</var>&#13;
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\W0rd.exe&#13;
taskkill /f /im W0rd.exe&#13;
ZwQueryInformationProcess&#13;
<var>--snip--</var></code></pre>&#13;
<p class="TX">In this case, FLOSS was able to decode some notable obfuscated strings including a filepath (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">C:\Program Files\Office\W0rd.exe</samp>), a command line tool reference (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">taskkill</samp>), and what could be a Windows function that the malware will import at a later point (<samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">ZwQueryInformationProcess</samp>). In <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter16.xhtml">Chapter 16</a></span>, I’ll discuss methods with which malware can obfuscate data, and I’ll also discuss how we can use FLOSS to reveal that data.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">StringSifter (<a href="https://github.com/mandiant/stringsifter"><i>https://<wbr/>github<wbr/>.com<wbr/>/mandiant<wbr/>/stringsifter</i></a>) takes the output from another string extraction tool, such as the aforementioned strings and FLOSS tools, and ranks and sorts the strings by their usefulness for <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_30" aria-label="30"/>and relevance to malware analysts. I won’t discuss StringSifter more in this book, but it can be very helpful for quickly analyzing a large set of strings.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<h5 class="H3" id="sec11"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Imports and Exports</samp></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI1">As <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter1.xhtml">Chapter 1</a></span> explained, imports are libraries and functions that the executable file is using, while exports are functions that the executable provides to other functions or programs for their use. Imports and exports can be used to get hints about the executable file’s intent. For example, if the file is importing libraries such as <i>Winhttp.dll</i>, we can make an educated guess (but always confirm!) that it may attempt to contact a remote server, such as a command and control server.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Once again, PEStudio can extract imports and exports from malware and display that information to you in an organized way, as demonstrated in <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-7">Figure 2-7</a>.</p>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img class="img100" id="fig2-7" src="../images/fig2-7.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 2-7: Function imports listed in PEStudio</samp></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">Here we can see the various Windows functions that this malware is importing and is likely to call during its execution. Some of the functions of special interest are the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">BCrypt*</samp> functions (possibly used to encrypt or decrypt data), <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">WriteProcessMemory</samp> and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">CreateRemoteThread</samp> (which may be used as part of process injection), and <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">WriteFile</samp> (which is used to write data to a file). Although not definitive evidence of a file’s maliciousness or capabilities, these functions are more clues that we can use during the malware analysis process.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec12">&#13;
&#13;
<h5 class="H3" id="sec12"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Metadata and Other Information</samp></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI1">Finally, the file’s metadata can give us clues about its intentions. PEStudio can show the file’s timestamps, which may represent when the file was first compiled. Also, it can show information about the programming language the file was written in, the various sections of the PE file, and even the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_31" aria-label="31"/>embedded certificates that may have been used to sign the file. In short, you can gather a wealth of additional information about a file using PE file analysis tools such as PEStudio. Be aware, however, that malware authors can alter and fake metadata, as we’ll explore later in this book.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec13"><span id="h-34"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Automated Malware Triage with Sandboxes</samp></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI1">After initially assessing your suspect file, you likely will still have questions. Even if you were able to determine what malware family the sample belongs to based on your initial analysis, you may still need to quickly identify its capabilities and extract key information. A good option is to use a malware analysis sandbox, which can provide a lot of information about the sample’s purpose, capabilities, and behaviors.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Malware analysis sandboxes are used to automate parts of the malware analysis process, especially initial triage. When a file is submitted to an automated sandbox, it is detonated (that is, executed) and its actions on the system are closely monitored. Automated sandboxes often produce a report of the file’s behaviors and capabilities after analysis.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">At the time of this writing, there are a myriad of sandboxes, each with different features. There are too many good sandboxes to list, but <a href="chapter2.xhtml#tab2-2">Table 2-2</a> lists some I have experience with and feel are worth mentioning. Many of these sandboxes allow you to upload files free of cost, but some have a limit on the number of files you are able to submit or other limitations for their free tiers. Note that the first two items in the list (CAPE and Cuckoo) are not commercial, so you’ll need to download the projects from GitHub and build them yourself. Additionally, take note that Cuckoo, at this time of writing, is not maintained anymore, but the project authors are working on a newer version.</p>&#13;

<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_32" aria-label="32"/>As with VirusTotal submissions, anything you submit to a public sandbox is immediately available to other researchers and the world. Make every effort to ensure the file you’re submitting doesn’t contain sensitive personal or business information, and consider the impact on the investigation if the sample is made available to the public.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX"><a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-8">Figure 2-8</a> shows the result of submitting our malware file to a Cuckoo sandbox instance.</p>&#13;

</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">This Cuckoo summary page has quite a bit of useful information, such as basic file information (file type, size, hashes, and so on), the detection score (“10 out of 10!”), and even Yara signatures. It seems that Cuckoo’s Yara engine is detecting this sample as possibly Gh0st or Ave Maria / Warzone. In comparison, Joe Sandbox reports that this sample is Ave Maria, as you can see in <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-9">Figure 2-9</a>.</p>&#13;
<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_33" aria-label="33"/>&#13;

</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">Simply knowing that this malware is likely associated with Ave Maria is helpful. This example also demonstrates that detonating a sample in more than one sandbox environment is never a bad idea. Sometimes different sandboxes can give different results, creating a more complete picture of the malware. Let’s inspect this sample in a bit more depth in Joe Sandbox. The malware’s process tree, shown in <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-10">Figure 2-10</a>, is a fundamental piece of information when you’re analyzing malware samples in a sandbox.</p>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img class="img100" id="fig2-10" src="../images/fig2-10.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 2-10: The malware’s process tree in Joe Sandbox</samp></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">This process tree shows the original malware executable’s process (<i>cY7cusWGCA.exe</i>) as well as all spawned child processes, which gives us some insight into the malware’s capabilities and behaviors. Notably, the PowerShell process is executing the command <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath C:\</samp>. This command adds the malware to the Windows Defender exclusion list, effectively bypassing anti-malware controls.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_34" aria-label="34"/>Also, the Anti Debugging section in Joe Sandbox, shown in <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-11">Figure 2-11</a>, illustrates some of the techniques that this sample may be using to detect and defend against debuggers.</p>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img class="img100" id="fig2-11" src="../images/fig2-11.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 2-11: The malware’s anti-debugging techniques in Joe Sandbox</samp></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">It appears that this malware sample may be using techniques such as dynamic library loading, manually reading the PEB, and calling <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">GetProcessHeap</samp> to detect debuggers.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">You can also see that Joe Sandbox has detected the use of several potential host defense evasion techniques, such as process injection and adding exclusions to Windows Defender (see <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-12">Figure 2-12</a>).</p>&#13;

<p class="NOTE-TXT"><i>Using sandboxes is always a wise first step in identifying and locating malware evasion techniques so that you can later circumvent them if necessary. Keep in mind, however, that sandbox results may be inconclusive or even incorrect. Always manually investigate sandbox results to verify the findings.</i></p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Finally, employing sandboxes is a great way to quickly extract <i>indicators of compromise (IOCs)</i> from malware samples. IOCs can be network artifacts (such as communication to a specific domain or IP address, or a specific HTTP header) or host artifacts (such as a specific filename or registry key modification, or suspicious command line execution) that you can use later to detect this malware and prevent it from infecting further hosts. For more information on what is and isn’t an IOC, visit <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/indicators-of-compromise/"><i>https://<wbr/>www<wbr/>.crowdstrike<wbr/>.com<wbr/>/cybersecurity<wbr/>-101<wbr/>/indicators<wbr/>-of<wbr/>-compromise<wbr/>/</i></a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">The Joe Sandbox environment was able to extract the command and control IP address from this sample, as shown in <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-13">Figure 2-13</a>.</p>&#13;

<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_36" aria-label="36"/>After analyzing the malware sample in a few sandboxes, we now have a fairly good assessment of many of its capabilities and behaviors. This malware sample is likely a variant of Ave Maria, and it is able to communicate with a command and control address (making it likely to download additional payloads), detect analysis tools such as debuggers, and evade host defenses using process injection and anti-malware bypass techniques. Depending on your malware analysis objectives for this investigation, this may be enough information for you. However, to understand a malware sample in detail, we must dive deeper.</p>&#13;

<p class="TNI1">Sandbox results can provide most of the information an analyst needs to determine a given malware’s intent, purpose, and potential impact, but key questions will likely remain unanswered. Many malware sandboxes are designed for quick-and-dirty analysis and initial assessment, and sometimes they don’t contain the detailed information that you may need during the investigation. Also, sandboxes can’t be easily modified on the fly to tailor the environment to the running malware, so their results may be incomplete, especially if the malware is using advanced sandbox detection and circumvention techniques.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX"><i>Interactive behavioral analysis</i> is a fancy term for manually detonating and monitoring malware in a controlled environment, rather than relying solely on fully automated detonation in a sandbox such as Cuckoo. Interactive behavioral analysis is a much more manual and, well, interactive process, giving you more freedom. This interactive analysis is typically conducted in a VM.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">One of the key reasons to use interactive behavioral analysis is that, if the malware sample is using sandbox detection techniques, you can attempt to thwart them by emulating a real user or otherwise giving the malware something it’s looking for. For example, malware may be searching for a specific file on the victim’s system, and since we fully control the interactive environment, we can provide this file so that the malware can continue executing. Fully automated sandboxes often fail in this regard.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">The tools we’ll explore are freely available. If you wish to follow along, you’ll need to download and install the following tools in a VM environment:</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec15"><span id="h-36"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_I_11">Monitoring Malware Behaviors</samp></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI1">A large part of interactive behavioral analysis is monitoring the malware’s behaviors or actions on the victim host. A popular tool for this is Process Monitor (Procmon), which is part of the Sysinternals suite. Procmon can capture many details of actions the malware takes on the host, such as spawning processes, reading and writing files and registries, and attempting to connect to the network. <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-14">Figure 2-14</a> shows the process tree in Procmon of a suspicious Microsoft Word file.</p>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img class="img100" id="fig2-14" src="../images/fig2-14.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 2-14: Analyzing a malware sample’s process tree in Procmon</samp></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">You can see that <i>WINWORD.EXE</i> (Microsoft Word) is spawning a suspicious process (<i>rundll32.exe</i>), a result that is always worth investigating further. The process tree can also be used to analyze parent-child process relationships and spot code injection mechanisms. We’ll discuss code injection in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a></span>.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">By inspecting the Files section of Procmon, we can see that this file is creating some suspect additional files (see <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-15">Figure 2-15</a>).</p>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img class="img100" id="fig2-15" src="../images/fig2-15.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 2-15: Viewing suspicious file writes in Procmon</samp></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">The main thing to notice here is the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">WriteFile</samp> operations, followed by the path where the file is being written. These two files (<i>diplo.ioe</i> and <i>flex.xz</i>) should be further inspected during analysis.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Similarly, <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-16">Figure 2-16</a> shows Procmon’s Registry tab.</p>&#13;
<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_38" aria-label="38"/>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img class="img100" id="fig2-16" src="../images/fig2-16.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 2-16: Viewing registry queries in Procmon</samp></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">The <i>rundll32.exe</i> process shown here is executing a <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">RegQueryValue</samp> operation, which indicates that it is reading several registry values on the host. The registry keys it’s particularly interested in all seem to be related to domain, hostname, and network adapter information. Registry-reading operations are not necessarily malicious, as all Windows applications must read different hives in the registry for normal operation, but sometimes they can hint at what the malware is trying to accomplish. In the case of targeted and evasive malware, as you’ll see throughout this book, it may be enumerating the registry and filesystem and searching for a specific value or pattern, such as a specific hostname or filepath.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Procmon is always a good first step in interactive behavior analysis. Suspicious activities revealed in Procmon can help further guide your investigation. For example, if the malware is writing to a strange file or reading a suspect registry key, part of interactive analysis is investigating those paths on the fly!</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Another tool for interactive analysis is Process Hacker, which, along with similar tools such as Process Explorer, can be used to inspect the process tree, investigate the malware process’s memory, and more. Memory inspection is a particularly useful task; you can do it by right-clicking the target process, selecting <b>Properties</b>, and then selecting the <b>Memory</b> tab. You can even query memory for specific string patterns. Searching for <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">http</samp> is always a good start, as you can see in <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-17">Figure 2-17</a>.</p>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img class="img100" id="fig2-17" src="../images/fig2-17.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 2-17: Querying process memory for a string pattern in Process Hacker</samp></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">The memory strings shown here contain some suspect data. We can see several URLs for domains such as <i>armerinin.com</i> and <i>siguages.ru</i>, which should be further investigated. The malware could be using these domains <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_39" aria-label="39"/>for command and control or downloading additional malware. Let’s test that theory.</p>&#13;

&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec16"><span id="h-37"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_I_11">Inspecting Malware Network Traffic</samp></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI1">Many malware samples will at some point attempt to connect to a remote server on the internet. They may do this for a variety of reasons, including the following:</p>&#13;
<ul class="ul">&#13;
<li class="BL">To download additional malicious files, payloads, and modules</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">To communicate with a command and control server, requesting further instructions</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">To send stolen information, such as credentials or files, to a remote server (often called <i>exfiltration</i>)</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">To determine whether the infected host is currently connected to the internet or to get the host’s public IP address (often used as a sandbox detection and evasion technique)</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">No matter the reason, it’s important to identify when and to whom the malware is connecting. A <i>web proxy</i> is a type of tool that can intercept and manipulate network traffic being sent to and from the host, and it serves as a great malware analysis tool. The web proxy Fiddler, shown in <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-18">Figure 2-18</a>, has captured some suspicious malware internet connection attempts.</p>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img class="img100" id="fig2-18" src="../images/fig2-18.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 2-18: Malware internet connection attempts in the Fiddler web proxy</samp></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">You can see that Fiddler has intercepted web requests to <i>api.ipify.org</i>, as well as three additional sites (<i>armerinin.com</i>, <i>houniant.ru</i>, and <i>siguages.ru</i>). If you query VirusTotal for the latter three domains, you’ll probably see that they’re rated as malicious. (They are at the time of this writing, anyway.) The malware is likely attempting to download additional malware from one of these domains. The <i>api.ipify.org</i> site simply returns a host’s external, public IP address. Why would the malware want to contact it? One possibility is that the malware is actually trying to obtain the host’s public IP address to identify its hosting country. Another possible reason is to determine whether the host is online at all. Both pieces of information can be used for anti-analysis and evasion, and I’ll discuss the associated techniques in greater depth throughout the book.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">The popular network monitoring tool Wireshark can also be used to capture internet connection activity. Additionally, Wireshark can capture general network activity, such as traffic not destined for the internet, like host-to-host communication on a local network. <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-19">Figure 2-19</a> displays some of this malware sample’s network connectivity in Wireshark.</p>&#13;
<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_40" aria-label="40"/>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img class="img100" id="fig2-19" src="../images/fig2-19.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 2-19: Malware DNS requests captured in Wireshark</samp></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">You can easily spot the DNS requests to the same hostnames that Fiddler found.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">It’s helpful to inspect HTTP and other protocol traffic in more detail. To view the web traffic, right-click an HTTP request and select <b>Follow</b><span class="MenuArrow"></span><b>TCP Stream</b>. You should see the HTTP POST request originating from this malware sample, as shown in <a href="chapter2.xhtml#fig2-20">Figure 2-20</a>.</p>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img class="img100" id="fig2-20" src="../images/fig2-20.jpg" alt=""/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 2-20: An HTTP POST request from the malware</samp></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">This sample is sending data such as the victim’s hostname, the IP address, and a unique identifier to its infrastructure (<i>siguages.ru</i>). Interestingly, the malware is also sending its <i>botnet ID</i> (in this case, “2209 _ubm”), which is an identifier assigned to a network of compromised computers. While this malware sends its data unencrypted, malware may also use encrypted channels for communication between the victim and its command and control infrastructure. This makes inspecting traffic in a web proxy or tool such as Wireshark more challenging. As we continue through the book, we’ll take a closer look at some of these techniques and how to overcome them.</p>&#13;

<p class="NOTE-TXT"><i>Many malware families try to determine whether a host is connected to the internet before infecting it as a sandbox evasion technique. If you’re investigating the malware in an offline (non-internet-connected) VM, you’ll likely want to use a tool that “fakes” network services, such as FakeNet or INetSim. I discuss these tools briefly in <a href="appendix-A.xhtml">Appendix A</a>.</i></p>&#13;

<p class="TNI1">This chapter covered the basics of triaging a malware sample to get a quick assessment and determine the next steps of your analysis. We discussed how automated malware sandboxes can be used as part of this process, as well as how to manually investigate malware behaviors in a controlled VM environment to understand them in greater detail. In the next chapter, we’ll look at how code analysis can supplement these triage and behavioral-analysis techniques.</p>&#13;

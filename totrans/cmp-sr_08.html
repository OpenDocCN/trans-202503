<p class="noindenttt"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_154"/>In this lesson, you’ll learn to watch videos on YouTube, a site with millions of videos available for free. Whether you want to hear Jane Fonda speak, learn how to change a tire, or watch a comedy show, you can do it all with your computer!</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3"><a id="toc_lev136"/>Watching Videos on YouTube</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">YouTube features millions of videos added by other people on the internet. On the YouTube website, you’ll find everything from clips of old TV shows to instructional videos showing how to fix your car, decorate a cake, or even upload your own YouTube video!</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4"><strong><a id="toc_lev137"/>PLAYING A VIDEO</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">To begin exploring YouTube, follow these steps:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">Open <strong>Microsoft Edge</strong> from the taskbar or the Start menu.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">Type the address <strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com">www.youtube.com</a></strong> into the address bar and press <small>ENTER</small>. You can also search for “youtube” in the Microsoft Edge search bar, as you learned in <a href="ch6.xhtml#ch6">Lesson 6</a>, and then click the link that matches this address.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">YouTube’s website should appear as shown in the following figure. Your page may look different because YouTube’s main page shows you a selection of videos it thinks you might like based on videos you’ve watched previously. If you haven’t watched any videos yet, it will likely show you the most popular videos in your region. Over time, YouTube’s suggestions should reflect your preferences.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">To view a video, click one that looks interesting on the YouTube home page. We’ll use the “Elton John Carpool Karaoke” video for this example, but you’ll probably have different videos on your page.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_155"/><img alt="Image" src="../images/f155-01.jpg"/></div></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">This link takes you to a page where your video loads and starts playing automatically. Keep in mind that a commercial might play before your actual video starts. YouTube makes money from advertisers who pay for their commercials to be shown before videos. After a few seconds into the commercial, you can sometimes skip it by clicking the Skip Ad button; if not, you may have to wait for the ad to finish playing.</p></li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<h4 class="h4"><strong><a id="toc_lev138"/>MEETING THE VIDEO PAGE</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The video should play automatically, but there are other functions of the video you’ll want to learn! For example, you can use the pause button to pause the video, the volume control to make the video louder or quieter, and the expand button to make the video larger. The following figure highlights the important parts of the video page.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_156"/><img alt="Image" src="../images/f156-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">These are the different sections of the screen:</p>&#13;
<p class="bullstar"><strong><span class="star-7">*</span></strong>   <strong>Video:</strong> This is the part of the screen where your video should play automatically.</p>&#13;
<p class="bullstar"><strong><span class="star-7">*</span></strong>   <strong>Video controls:</strong> These buttons let you play, pause, and otherwise control the video. (More on these in the next section.)</p>&#13;
<p class="bullstar"><strong><span class="star-7">*</span></strong>   <strong>Video description:</strong> This is a summary of the video. You can click “Show More” to read more information, if there’s more.</p>&#13;
<p class="bullstar"><strong><span class="star-7">*</span></strong>   <strong>Similar videos:</strong> This is a list of other videos you might like to see based on your choice of this video. You can click any one of these videos to go to that video’s page, and it will start playing. The video at the top of this list, titled “Up next,” should play automatically once the current video finishes.</p>&#13;
<p class="bullstar"><strong><span class="star-7">*</span></strong>   <strong>Comments:</strong> If you scroll down, you should see comments made about the video by other YouTube users.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_157"/><strong><a id="toc_lev139"/>YOUTUBE VIDEO CONTROLS</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The video controls play, pause, and otherwise adjust your video. Let’s take a look at them now.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f157-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="bullstar"><strong><span class="star-7">*</span></strong>   <strong>Progress bar:</strong> This bar shows the length of the video. The red section of the bar shows how much of the video you’ve watched.</p>&#13;
<p class="bullstar"><strong><span class="star-7">*</span></strong>   <strong>Timer:</strong> A timer underneath shows the length of the video (5 minutes, 8 seconds long) and how much of it you’ve already watched (18 seconds).</p>&#13;
<p class="bullstar"><strong><span class="star-7">*</span></strong>   <strong>Play/pause button:</strong> This button stops the video. Once pressed, it changes to a play button, which you can click to resume the video.</p>&#13;
<p class="bullstar"><strong><span class="star-7">*</span></strong>   <strong>Next video:</strong> This button skips the current video and starts the next one in the “Up next” list on the right side of your screen.</p>&#13;
<p class="bullstar"><strong><span class="star-7">*</span></strong>   <strong>Volume control:</strong> This control lets you turn the volume up or down. Hover your mouse cursor over this button to bring up a slider. You can click the white line and drag it to the right to turn up the volume or left to turn it down. Clicking the volume button mutes the video. Clicking the volume button again unmutes the video.</p>&#13;
<p class="bullstar"><strong><span class="star-7">*</span></strong>   <strong>Subtitles:</strong> This turns on subtitles/closed captions for the video, if they’re available. Subtitles can be terrific if you’re having difficulty hearing the video, but note that not all videos have subtitles available. If subtitles aren’t available, this button won’t appear.</p>&#13;
<p class="bullstar"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_158"/><strong><span class="star-7">*</span></strong>   <strong>Settings:</strong> This option lets you control the video’s quality settings. YouTube chooses the best settings automatically, so we won’t look at this in detail.</p>&#13;
<p class="bullstar"><strong><span class="star-7">*</span></strong>   <strong>Theater mode:</strong> This button makes the video screen bigger.</p>&#13;
<p class="bullstar"><strong><span class="star-7">*</span></strong>   <strong>Full screen:</strong> This button gives you the cinematic experience! Click this button, and the video will take up your entire screen so that you can see it clearly. Once clicked, this button should change to the exit full screen button. Clicking it should return your video to normal size. You can also return to the normal-sized video by pressing the <small>ESC</small> key on your keyboard.</p>&#13;
<div class="sidebar7">&#13;
<p class="sidetitle"><strong><a id="toc_lev140"/>ACTIVITY #19</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll practice playing a YouTube video and adjusting some of its controls. Before you begin, return to the YouTube home page by clicking the <strong>back button</strong>.</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">Start watching a video.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">Adjust the volume to a suitable level.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">Pause the video.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">Resume playing the video.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">Put the video into full screen mode.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">Return the video to normal size.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">Watch another video from the list of similar videos.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">Return to the YouTube home page.</p></li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_159"/><strong><a id="toc_lev141"/>SEARCHING FOR A YOUTUBE VIDEO</strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The list of videos on the YouTube home page is quite limited. Only a few dozen can fit on this screen, but YouTube has literally billions of videos to choose from! With the search feature, you can find a particular video or many videos on a particular topic. To search for a video, follow these steps:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">Click in the search box at the top of any YouTube page.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">Type a few words that describe the type of video you’re looking for. In the following example, we use “cake decorating.”</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f159-01.jpg"/></div></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">Click the <strong>search button</strong> or press the <small>ENTER</small> key.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">This should bring up a list of results, as shown here.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f159-02.jpg"/></div></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_160"/>Next to each video, you should see some useful information, including the length of the video, a brief description, the date it was published on YouTube, and its total number of views. This information can help you choose the video you want! For example, you might not want to sit through a two-hour documentary, or you might only be interested in videos created this year.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">Click the video you want to watch.</p></li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p class="noindent">When you’ve finished watching the video (or if it’s not what you were looking for), you can either choose another video from the list of similar videos on the right side of the screen or click the back button to return to the search results.</p>&#13;
<div class="sidebar7">&#13;
<p class="sidetitle"><strong><a id="toc_lev142"/>ACTIVITY #20</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In this activity, you’ll practice searching for and opening a specific video on YouTube.</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">Search for videos on how to change a car tire.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">Watch a video. Now you know how to change a tire!</p></li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3"><a id="toc_lev143"/>Explore: TED Talks</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The TED (technology, education, design) website features a variety of presentations by innovative leaders in the fields of business, academia, entertainment, politics, and more. The topics vary, but all are designed to be informative, entertaining, and thought-provoking. Best of all, these presentations, called TED Talks, are completely free and available to watch anytime!</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_161"/>To watch a TED Talk, enter <strong><a href="http://www.ted.com">www.ted.com</a></strong> into your address bar, press <small>ENTER</small>, and then click any video that looks interesting to play it.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f161-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3"><a id="toc_lev144"/>Explore: Netflix</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Netflix is a popular website that lets you watch a huge range of movies and TV shows online, whenever you like. This is known as <em>streaming</em>. It’s so popular that more than 50 million American households have subscribed to Netflix.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Unfortunately, unlike YouTube and TED Talks, it’s not completely free; Netflix requires a monthly subscription fee, but you can watch as many movies and shows as you like as a subscriber. You can try it for free for a month, and if you don’t want to keep it after the trial period is over, you can cancel your subscription at no cost.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_162"/><img alt="Image" src="../images/f162-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You need to provide payment details to use Netflix, even for the free trial, so it’s worth flipping back to “<a href="ch6.xhtml#toc_lev133">Online Shopping Tips</a>” on <a href="ch6.xhtml#page_150">page 150</a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">To sign up for Netflix, follow these steps:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">From Microsoft Edge, type <strong><a href="http://www.netflix.com">www.netflix.com</a></strong> in the address bar, or search for “netflix” and find the correct link.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">Click <strong>jOIN FREE FOR A MONTH</strong> and then type the information requested, including your payment information.</p></li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p class="noindent">After you create an account and sign in, you should be able to see the entire range of movies and TV shows available on Netflix. You can scroll down to see the different categories. Use the left and right arrows to see more results within each category. You can also use the search box at the top of the page to look for a particular title or actor.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_163"/><img alt="Image" src="../images/f163-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3"><a id="toc_lev145"/>Explore: Crackle</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Crackle is another online streaming site, run by Sony. Like Netflix, it contains a range of movies and TV shows you can watch from your computer. There aren’t as many titles available, but Crackle is completely free to use and is funded by advertisements rather than a subscription fee. You can watch videos without even having to sign up, or you can create an account and let Crackle recommend videos it thinks you’ll like.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f163-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_164"/><a id="toc_lev146"/>Phew, We Did It!</h3>&#13;

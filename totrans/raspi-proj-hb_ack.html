<p class="noindent">We both want to thank the No Starch Press team who have done such a great job producing this book. Special thanks to Liz Chadwick for the invitation to write this book and for her endless patience editing our non-native English writing. We also want to thank Laurel Chun for her attention to detail and for producing this book’s beautiful layout. Thanks to Les Pounder for his technical contribution and suggestions.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Many thanks to the Raspberry Pi Foundation for developing this tiny but powerful computer that made electronics and coding more accessible to general public.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We must also thank our friends and family for being supportive throughout this entire journey. Finally, we would like to thank the Random Nerd Tutorials community who indirectly have also made this book possible.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentt">Writing this book wouldn’t have been possible if it wasn’t for Sara Santos’s work and support, and her tireless effort to meet all the deadlines. I thank her greatly.</p>&#13;

<p class="noindentt">I would like to thank my coauthor Rui Santos for inviting me to take part in this journey. Thanks for showing me that we can work in something we love; we just have to chase our dreams.</p>&#13;

- en: PHP is a *scripted* programming language. This means a program called an *interpreter*
    translates the contents of a PHP file into machine code as the file is being executed.
    Other scripted languages include Python and JavaScript. Scripted languages are
    different from *compiled* programming languages like C, C++, and Swift, in which
    the translation happens in a separate step prior to execution. During this extra
    step, all program files are compiled and optimized into one or more executable
    files.
  id: totrans-27
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The interpreter that translates PHP scripts into executable code is usually
    called the *PHP engine*. When you click Replit’s Run button to run the *main.php*
    file, Replit invokes the PHP engine, which then reads the contents of the file
    and interprets and executes the lines of code inside it. For simple PHP scripts
    (such as our Replit *main.php*) that consist of just one or more statements meant
    to be executed in order, this is a straightforward process. Almost all programs
    involve more complex decision logic, however, performing tests so the code can
    respond dynamically to events and determine which statements to execute and in
    which order. The way the PHP engine decides what to do next is referred to as
    the *flow of control*. We’ll explore this concept further when we discuss conditionals
    and loops in [Chapters 4](chapter4.xhtml) and [6](chapter6.xhtml).

    <p> tags, meaning it will be rendered on the resulting web page as a body paragraph,

    PHP scripts to output HTML (or CSS or JavaScript) for display in a web browser.
    Some parts of the output are typically unchanging *template text*, while other
    parts are dynamically generated through the execution of PHP program statements.

    The web designer doesn’t need to write a separate script for displaying every
    possible configuration of items in a shopping cart. They just have to write one
    script that mixes the generic template text for the elements that would appear
    in any shopping cart (the hidden HTML head elements, a navigation bar, the company
    logo, and the like) with the PHP code needed to dynamically fill in the name,
    price, quantity, and other details of each specific cart item.

    <?php tag in our scripts so far, and why we sometimes need the closing ?> tag
    as well. Anything outside these tags is treated as template text and will be output
    verbatim; anything inside these tags is interpreted as PHP code and executed accordingly.
    If the script consists entirely of PHP code, as in [Listings 1-1](#lis1-1), [1-3](#lis1-3),
    and [1-4](#lis1-4), then only the opening <?php is needed; if the PHP code is

    needed as well.

    their behavior can change each time they’re executed based on different data and

    to data within code. Variables allow you to store values and refer to them with
    a meaningful name (an *identifier*).
  id: totrans-119
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a program is executed. For example, a variable might refer to the current date
    or time, and a program might have logic to do something special based on the value
    of this variable. Perhaps it will display a greeting on the user’s birthday or
    trigger an alarm each day at 6 AM. Another variable might represent the size of
    a logfile, and the program might automatically back up the contents of this file
    and start a new one whenever the size exceeds a certain threshold.

    they can also change *during* the course of a program’s execution. For example,

    at 0 and then update as items are added or removed. A variable holding the number
    of simultaneous users logged into a system would also change as a program runs.
    At busy times, if the value is very high, more memory or disk space may need to
    be added to the system.

    PHP code from almost all other programming languages. Assigning a value to a variable
    hinges around an equal sign (=), known in this context as the *assignment operator*.
    The variable name goes on the left of the equal sign and its value on the right.
    Since setting a variable’s value is a type of statement, the whole thing ends
    with a semicolon.
  id: totrans-125
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The code to the right of the assignment operator is an expression. An *expression*
    is something that yields a single value or can be evaluated into a single value.
    The simplest expression is simply a literal value, like the number 21 in this
    example. A *literal* is a value that is expressed as itself. Examples are 21 (the
    whole number twenty-one), 3.5 (the floating-point number three-point-five), true
    (the truth value true), and "Matt Smith" (the text string Matt Smith).

    incorporate other variables, or even, as you’ll see in [Chapter 5](chapter5.xhtml),
    feature a call to a function. In these cases, the expression must be *evaluated*,
    meaning its resulting value is determined, before that value is assigned to the
    variable. [Listing 1-8](#lis1-8) illustrates some examples of assignment statements.

- en: A few rules and conventions exist for naming variables in PHP. First and foremost,
    as we’ve already discussed, all variable names must start with a dollar sign.
    If you forget the dollar sign when referencing a variable, PHP will usually report
    an undefined constant fatal error, and the program will crash. (We’ll discuss
    constants in the next section.)
  id: totrans-142
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next character in a variable name after the dollar sign must be a letter
    of the alphabet (or in certain cases, an underscore). By convention, this letter
    should be lowercase. While a capital letter is technically permitted, an initial
    capital is usually reserved for class names rather than variable names. (You’ll
    begin learning about classes and object-oriented programming in [Part V](part5.xhtml).)
    The remaining symbols in a variable name can be letters, numerals, or underscores.
  id: totrans-143
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Single-word variable names should typically be all lowercase, as in $name or
    $total. For variable names with multiple words, we follow two common conventions.
    One is *snake case* : everything is lowercase, and the words are separated by
    underscores, as in $game_lives_remaining or $customer_number. The other is *lower
    camel case*: the first word is all lowercase, and subsequent words start with
    a capital letter, as in $gameLivesRemaining or $customerNumber.'
  id: totrans-144
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most important rules of thumb are to be consistent in whatever naming convention
    you choose, to follow PHP’s style recommendations when possible, and above all,
    to choose names that clearly communicate what the variable represents. A name
    like $customerNumber is clearer than something abbreviated like $custNo and certainly
    clearer than a meaningless variable name like $x or $variable.
  id: totrans-145
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    $username and $userName will be treated as separate variables. If you get the
    capitalization wrong when you reference a variable (or otherwise type the variable
    name incorrectly), PHP won’t know what you mean. [Listing 1-10](#lis1-10) shows
    an example.

    other aspects of the language are case insensitive, meaning capitalization doesn’t
    matter. These include keywords like if, for, switch, and print; data types such
    as int and string; values such as true and false; and function and method names.
    That said, it’s common practice to use lowercase for language keywords and data
    types, and lower camel case for function and method names. The exercises at the
    end of the chapter suggest a coding style guide that can help you learn more about
    these conventions.

    the constant wouldn’t work. For example, if you were to write define(MAX_PROJECTS,
    99) without quotes, PHP would interpret MAX _PROJECTS as a reference to a previously
    defined constant and would report an error. Once you’ve defined a constant, however,
    you don’t need the quotation marks when you reference it.

- en: As in mathematics, these operators have an *order of precedence* that controls
    the way an expression is evaluated when it contains multiple operations. The arithmetic
    operators for multiplication, division, and modulo have higher precedence, while
    the operators for addition and subtraction have lower precedence. Therefore, in
    the arithmetic expression 1 + 2 * 3, the 2 * 3 component will first be evaluated
    to 6, and then 1 + 6 will be evaluated, so the whole expression evaluates to 7.
    You can use parentheses to force precedence; for example, the expression (1 +
    2) * 3 evaluates to 9 rather than 7 since the parentheses force the addition component
    to be evaluated to 3 before the multiplication component.

- en: We’ve already discussed how the basic = assignment operator takes a value and
    assigns it to a variable. Other assignment operators, such as += and -=, combine
    assignment with arithmetic. These combined operators exist because it’s common
    to want to take the value in a variable, perform a calculation with it, and store
    the result back in the same variable, replacing the previous value.

    cost of the items in an online shopping cart. Every time the user adds or removes
    an item from the cart, we’d want to change $total by the cost of that item. We
    could do this with the regular = operator by writing something like $total = $total
    + 25 or $total = $total - 15. With combined arithmetic assignment operators, however,
    we can accomplish the same task by using more concise syntax: $total += 25 or
    $total -= 15. These statements instruct the PHP engine to update the value of
    the $total variable by adding 25 or subtracting 15 from its previous value.'

    much less often.

    by 1) using special operators: a double plus sign (++) for incrementing and a
    double minus sign (--) for decrementing. As with the combined arithmetic assignment
    operators, ++ and -- provide a more concise syntax for a common programming task.
    For example, to add 1 to the existing value of the $age variable, we could use
    the basic assignment operator and write $age = $age + 1, or use an arithmetic
    assignment operator and write $age += 1. With the increment operator, however,
    we simply write $age++. Likewise, $age-- subtracts 1 from the value of $age. These
    are examples of *unary operators*, meaning they expect only a single operand.'

- en: When you want to use the result of an increment or decrement operation in an
    expression, the placement of the operator before or after the value it operates
    on matters. Say $age contains an integer value of 21. The expression $age++ yields
    the current value of $age (21) and then increments the variable. On the other
    end, ++$age will first apply the increment and then yield the variable’s newly
    incremented value (22). [Listing 1-12](#lis1-12) illustrates this distinction.

    21 to 22 before it’s first printed. By contrast, placing the ++ operator after
    $person2Age allows us to first see its original value of 21 ❶, since it forces
    the increment operation to take place after the variable’s value is used in the
    expression.

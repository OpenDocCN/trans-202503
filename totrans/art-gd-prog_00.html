<h2 id="h1-501645f05-0001"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xiv" id="Page_xiv"/>The Basics of a Programming Language: Processing</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">When someone programs a computer, they are really communicating with it. It is an imperative and precise communication. Imperative because the computer has no choice; it is being told what to do, and it will do exactly that. Precise because a computer does not apply any interpretation to what it is being told. Computers do not think and so can’t evaluate a command that would amount to “expose the patient to a fatal dose of radiation” with any skepticism. So we, as programmers, must be careful and precise in what we instruct the machine to do.</p>
<p>When humans communicate with each other, we use a language. Similarly, humans use languages to communicate with computers, but these languages are artificial (humans invented them for this purpose), terse (there are few if any modifiers—no way to express emotions or gradations of any feeling), precise (each item in the language means one thing), and written (we do not yet speak to computers in a programming language). </p>
<p>The process of programming begins with a problem to be solved, and the first step is to state the problem as clearly as possible. Then we analyze the problem and determine methods by which it may be solved. Computers can only directly manipulate numbers, so it is common for solutions discussed at this stage to be numerical or mathematical. A sketch of the solution, perhaps on paper in a human language and math, is created. This is then translated into computer language and typed into the computer using a keyboard. The resulting text file is called a <span class="KeyTerm">script, source code</span>, or more commonly the <span class="KeyTerm">computer program</span>. Next, another program called a <span class="KeyTerm">compiler</span> takes the program and converts it into a form that can be executed on the computer. Basically, all programs are converted into <span class="KeyTerm">machine code,</span> which consists of numbers, and which the computer can execute.</p>
<p>You are going to learn a language called <span class="KeyTerm">Processing</span>. It was developed for use by artists, but it’s pretty good for lots of things, and it’s good for teaching because it makes a lot of things easy and it always has graphical visual output. It is much like a lot of other languages in use these days in terms of structure (syntax). It is, in fact, the language Java enclosed in some special easy-to-use packaging. A Processing program is called a <span class="KeyTerm">sketch</span> in honor of its artistic origins.</p>
<p>In order to use a programming language, you need to understand some basic concepts and structures, at least at a basic level. These concepts will be introduced in this introduction. The rest of the book will teach you to program by example: when you open the book to a random location, the left page will almost always outline a problem or Processing language concept, and the right page will almost always show code that illustrates that concept, along with a screen image of the output from that program. The idea is to introduce only one or two new things on any page. The code will execute on a computer running any major operating system, once the free Processing language download has been installed. Go to <a href="https://processing.org/download" class="LinkURL">https://processing.org/download</a> and download the latest stable version for your OS.</p>
<p>To begin programming, you need to appreciate that a language has a syntax or structure, and for computer languages this structure cannot be varied. The computer will always be the arbiter of what is correct, and if any program has a syntax error or produces erroneous results, it is the program and not the computer that is at fault.</p>
<p>Next you need to appreciate that the syntax is arbitrary. It was designed by a human with attitudes and biases and new ideas, and while the syntax might be ugly or hard to recall, it is what it is. You might not understand parts of it at first, but after a while and after reading and executing the first 50 or 60 sketches in this book, most of it will make sense.</p>
<p>A program consists of symbols, and their order matters. Some symbols are special characters with a defined meaning. For example, <code>+</code> usually means <em>add</em>, and <code>−</code> usually <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xv" id="Page_xv"/>means <em>subtract</em>. Some symbols are words, and words defined by the language, like <code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>true</code>, cannot be also defined by a programmer—they mean what the language says they mean, and they are called <span class="KeyTerm">reserved words</span>. Some names have a definition given by the system but can be reused by a programmer if needed. These are called <span class="KeyTerm">predefined names</span> or <span class="KeyTerm">system variables</span>. However, some words can be defined by the programmer and are names for things the programmer wants to use in the program: <span class="KeyTerm">variables</span> and <span class="KeyTerm">functions</span> are examples.</p>
<h2 id="h1-501645f05-0002">The Beginning</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">All sketches have the same basic structure. There is something called <code>setup()</code> (a predefined name) that gets executed just once, when the program begins. This is where we will do initializations, such as defining the size of the output window. If we need to read a bunch of images or sounds from files, this is where we might do it. </p>
<aside epub:type="sidebar">
<div class="top hr"><hr/></div>
<section class="note">
<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
<p>	This discussion presents a template that can be used to start coding any program. Detailed explanation of the syntax will come later.</p>
<div class="bottom hr"><hr/></div>
</section>
</aside>
<p>The syntax of <code>setup()</code> is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>void setup ()
{
    <var>your code goes here</var>
}</code></pre>
<p>This is something we call a <span class="KeyTerm">function</span> in Processing (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Sketch 24">Sketch 24</span>). It is a bunch of code that is enclosed in braces (the <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>) and is given a name. It gets executed (<span class="KeyTerm">called</span>, we say) when we use the name in code later on. In this case the function is named <code>setup()</code>, and it is invoked automatically by Processing just once, when the program starts executing. The word <code>void</code> (a reserved word) is not important just now, but it means the function does not return a value. </p>
<p>After <code>setup()</code> has finished, a window will open on the screen where the program will draw. This is called the <span class="KeyTerm">sketch window</span>, and its size is one of the things initialized within <code>setup()</code>.</p>
<h2 id="h1-501645f05-0003">The Middle</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The second part of a sketch is another function, one named <code>draw()</code>. This function is called many times each second (the default is 60 times, but this can be changed), and its purpose is to update the drawing being made by the program. Processing assumes that the programmer is writing a program to draw a picture of some kind. </p>
<p>Every 1/60 of a second, the Processing system will call the <code>draw()</code> function. Whatever code appears there will be executed each time, and the idea is that the programmer can update the picture being created there as a user watches. For example, if a set of images of a moving animal is displayed one at a time, the result will be an animated image of the animal. The programmer can draw shapes, display text and images, change colors, and move shapes about the screen as the user watches.</p>
<p>The syntax of <code>draw </code>(a predefined name) is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>void draw ()
{
  <var>your code goes here</var>
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="h1-501645f05-0004"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xvi" id="Page_xvi"/>The Rest</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The programmer writes code that is inside either of the functions <code>setup()</code> and <code>draw()</code> or that is executed by those functions. Any part of the program that cannot be reached from <code>setup()</code> or <code>draw()</code> will never be executed (except for some of the mouse and keyboard functions). </p>
<p>The programmer can name and provide code for other functions, and these can be executed by (called from) <code>draw()</code> or <code>setup()</code>. These functions are usually placed after the <code>draw()</code> function in the program. For example, if the programmer wanted to define a function named <code>doSomething()</code>, it might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>void doSomething ()
{
  <var>your code goes here</var>
}</code></pre>
<p>This would be executed when its name was used in a call:</p>
<pre><code>void draw ()
{
  doSomething();
}</code></pre>
<p>The semicolon is used to end a statement so that Processing knows when the programmer thinks a statement ends. It is used to detect errors: if a programmer thinks the statement is complete and the Processing compiler does not, the compiler issues an error message. The compiler is, after all, always right.</p>
<h2 id="h1-501645f05-0005">Variables</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The concept of a variable is one that most beginners find difficult. Essentially, a variable is a place to put a result, usually a number. In a programming language, a variable is represented by a name, and the connection between the name and the value is established by a statement in the language called an <span class="KeyTerm">assignment statement</span>: it assigns a value to a variable. Here’s an example:</p>
<pre><code>count = 0;</code></pre>
<p>This establishes that the value of a variable named <code>count</code> is <code>0</code>. How do we know that the name <code>count</code> is a variable? It must appear in a <span class="KeyTerm">declaration</span>: we “declare” that <code>count</code> is a variable, and we specify a type. The type defines the set of values that can be assigned to the variable. For a numerical variable, common types are <code>integer</code> and <code>float</code> (a decimal fraction). If <code>count</code> is to be an integer, then this would be the declaration:</p>
<pre><code>int count;</code></pre>
<p>The predefined name <code>int</code> means integer, and this declaration states that the name <code>count</code> will hold an integer. If it were supposed to be a number with a fraction (a <span class="KeyTerm">real</span> or <span class="KeyTerm">floating-point</span> number) the declaration would be as follows:</p>
<pre><code>float count;</code></pre>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xvii" id="Page_xvii"/>A variable can only be used after it has been declared. It is an error to attempt to use a variable that has not been in a declaration, partly because its type would not be known. </p>
<p>Now that you can define variables, you can do complex computations. For arithmetic the usual operations are possible: <code>+</code> (add), <code>−</code> (subtract), <code>*</code> (multiply), and <code>/</code> (divide). Both variables and constants can be used in mathematical expressions, just as in algebra. The following would be a legal assignment statement (assuming that the name <code>radius</code> was declared):</p>
<pre><code>count = 2 * 3.1419926 * radius;</code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">It would calculate the circumference of a circle with the given radius.</p>
<h2 id="h1-501645f05-0006">How to Write a Program</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">When Processing is started, either by clicking <em>processing.exe</em> or by clicking a Processing source file, the integrated development environment (IDE) will open a window on the screen. It will look something like <a href="#figure-1" id="figureanchor-1">Figure 1</a>, though it may look a little different depending on your operating system and the version of Processing you use.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Images/f00001.png" alt="f00001" class="keyline" width="628" height="510"/>
<figcaption><p><a href="#figureanchor-1" id="figure-1">Figure 1</a>:	A new window in the Processing integrated development environment</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This particular sketch is called <em>start</em>, and it resides in a file named <em>start.pde</em> (<em>pde</em> stands for <em>Processing Development Environment</em>). The <em>start.pde</em> file must also be located within a directory named <em>start</em>. That’s just the rule.</p>
<p>Now you can start typing code, and it will appear inside the white rectangle in the window. This code will execute when the start icon <span class="GraphicInline"><img src="Images/i00001.png" alt="i00001" width="23" height="23"/></span> is clicked, and running code will halt when the stop icon <span class="GraphicInline"><img src="Images/i00002.png" alt="i00002" width="20" height="23"/></span> is clicked.</p>
<p>Let’s try a simple program: one that draws a circle. First, enter the basic empty program just described, as shown in <a href="#figure-2" id="figureanchor-2">Figure 2</a>.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xviii" id="Page_xviii"/><figure>
<img src="Images/f00002.png" alt="f00002" class="keyline" width="800" height="295"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure-2" href="#figureanchor-2">Figure 2</a>:	The basic structure of a Processing program</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now we can write our code. We wish to draw a circle, and Processing will open a drawing window for us. We should specify its size so it’s not too small. In <code>setup()</code> we can use the predefined <code>size()</code> function to specify a sketch window with a size of 400 pixels horizontally and 300 pixels vertically. </p>
<p>We want the <code>draw()</code> function to draw a circle every time it is called, 60 times per second by default. In Processing, a circle is a special case of an ellipse, having equal width and height. The <code>ellipse()</code> function draws an ellipse with its center at specified coordinates (the first two values in the parentheses after the function name) and having a width and height specified by the second pair of values. These values in parentheses after a function name are called <span class="KeyTerm">parameters.</span> The background color is set by default to a medium grey, and the color that fills the circle is white. The circle is outlined by a black line.</p>
<p>The call <code>ellipse (200, 100, 50, 50)</code> will draw an ellipse centered at (200, 100) that is 50 pixels wide and 50 pixels high. Once this code is entered, the window will look like <a href="#figure-3" id="figureanchor-3">Figure 3</a>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Images/f00003.png" alt="f00003" class="keyline" width="800" height="296"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure-3" href="#figureanchor-3">Figure 3</a>:	The code for drawing a circle</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now click the start icon. A new window opens with our drawing, as shown in <a href="#figure-4" id="figureanchor-4">Figure 4</a>. </p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xix" id="Page_xix"/><figure>
<img src="Images/f00004.png" alt="f00004" class="" width="486" height="365"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure-4" href="#figureanchor-4">Figure 4</a>:	The drawing window</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You have learned a few things. The value 200 in the ellipse is the x or horizontal position, and 100 is the y or vertical position. The value 50 is the size of ellipse, which in this case is a circle because the horizontal and vertical sizes are the same. The circle is filled with a color, in this case white, and it has a black line around it.</p>
<p>The remainder of this book essentially involves learning by doing. There’s a lot of code and relatively little explanation. You can experiment with the code, change the parameters, and see what happens. That’s the whole point. You’ll learn the syntax by example and by trying things out.</p>

    up your hacking environment. You’ll configure your browser to work with Burp Suite,
    a web proxy that lets you view and alter HTTP requests and responses sent between
    your browser and web servers. You’ll learn to use Burp’s features to intercept
    web traffic, send automated and repeated requests, decode encoded content, and
    compare requests. I will also talk about how to take good bug bounty notes.

    Your operating system will limit the hacking tools available to you. I recommend
    using a Unix-based system, like Kali Linux or macOS, because many open source
    hacking tools are written for these systems. *Kali Linux* is a Linux distribution
    designed for digital forensics and hacking. It includes many useful bug bounty
    tools, such as Burp Suite, recon tools like DirBuster and Gobuster, and fuzzers
    like Wfuzz. You can download Kali Linux from [https://www.kali.org/downloads/](https://www.kali.org/downloads/).

    if you are like me and prefer to store notes in plaintext, you can search around
    for an integrated development environment (IDE) or text editor that you feel the
    most comfortable in. Some prefer to take notes using the Markdown format. In this
    case, Obsidian ([https://obsidian.md/](https://obsidian.md/)) is an excellent
    tool that displays your notes in an organized way. If you like to use mind maps
    to organize your ideas, you can try the mind-mapping tool XMind ([https://www.xmind.net/](https://www.xmind.net/)).

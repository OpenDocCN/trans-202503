- en: An image scanner is an independent device that connects to the computer by a
    USB or an IEEE 1394 (Firewire) connection. In this book, we cover only the flatbed
    type, where the document is placed on glass and the charged coupled device (CCD)
    sensors move across the glass while the document is lit. The same manufacturers
    that make printers (such as Canon and Epson) generally also make scanners. The
    prices are in the same range, and multifunction devices in which a scanner and
    printer are combined are more and more common, including in low-cost models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most people buy a scanner to digitize photographs or sketches, so, for most
    people, an automatic feeder is unnecessary and a letter-size (or A4) glass size
    is sufficient. If you need to scan a large quantity of documents, you may consider
    buying a scanner with an automatic feeder, and if you’re an artist who works in
    large format, you may need a larger glass size. Many people want to scan photographic
    negatives or slides, which requires a specific device lit from behind; look for
    this capability in the scanner’s specifications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Scanning speed is generally not very important, as long as scanning a normal-sized
    photograph does not take more than a minute. Scanning resolution is more important,
    but be warned that, as always with numeric information, resolution is used as
    a marketing point— a larger number is not necessarily better. A scanner has an
    intrinsic maximum resolution, depending on the number of CCD cells that compose
    the sensor array. Larger resolutions can be obtained by interpolation, which means
    they are a digital simulation of a higher resolution, which can also be done in
    GIMP. The physical, true resolution of a scanner is called the *optical resolution*,
    and only the optical resolution should be considered when comparing different
    models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Actually, a large resolution is often not needed. If you intend to print the
    scanned image in the same size, 300 ppi (pixels per inch) is enough. If you intend
    to enlarge the image a lot—for example, the original is a 35 mm slide and you
    want to print it in letter-size format— 1200 ppi is probably enough. So resolutions
    of 4800 or 9600 ppi, frequently advertised for scanners, are not only artificially
    inflated but also useless for most people.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most important factors to take into account when buying a scanner are its
    precision and fidelity in rendering the values and colors of the image’s pixels.
    Look at websites that compare the capabilities, performance, and prices of various
    scanner models.

    Easy, or SANE, website (*[http://www.sane-project.org/](http://www.sane-project.org/)*)
    to make sure a scanner model will be recognized on your platform. Don’t worry
    if you cannot buy the most recent scanner with all the bells and whistles: The
    bells and whistles are often useless, and the standard model, when correctly handled
    by SANE, will meet all your needs.'
  prefs: []

    their devices without any thought to free and open source software. They provide
    drivers and applications only for Windows and Mac operating systems. The goal
    of the SANE project is to provide a free software version of the drivers for as
    many scanner models as possible. It constitutes a front-end for the scanner, which
    also requires a back-end to handle the digitized image. Several back-ends are
    available for GNU/Linux and Mac OS but not for Windows. Windows users can use
    the application shipped with the scanner, or they can use a client back-end, which
    gets its information from a GNU/Linux server running SANE, or from a SANE to TWAIN
    converter application.

    trial or feature-limited versions of commercial image-processing applications,
    but since we’re using GIMP, we don’t need them. The scanner comes with its own
    specific application as well, which allows you to use its unique front panel buttons.
    You can use the scanner without these buttons without any real problem; they’re
    designed to make the scanner faster or easier to use but are not the only way
    to interface with it. For the purposes of this book, we want to digitize a picture
    so it’s as unchanged as possible, and then we want to process it in GIMP.

    10 megapixels, then, assuming 3 bytes per pixel, a full photograph would take
    up 30MB. Even with a memory card of considerable size, this severely limits the
    number of pictures that you can store. Moreover, saving large image files onto
    the card takes time, so you wouldn’t be able to take several pictures in quick
    succession.

    compression factors. Usually image files can range from 30KB for the lowest definition
    and highest compression factor to 4MB for the highest definition and lowest compression.
    Of course, the number of images the memory card can store is inversely related
    to the picture file size. Unless you want to take a lot of pictures in a short
    time, choose the best photograph quality: The result that you can get when editing
    a picture in GIMP is limited by the quality of the initial image. Although JPEG
    is standard, some people prefer TIFF because they say it uses a lossless compression
    algorithm. TIFF doesn’t actually use any compression algorithm, but a TIFF image
    may specify an algorithm, which can be lossless. It can also use a JPEG compression
    algorithm, which is lossy. A TIFF file is always much larger than the equivalent
    JPEG file and can’t be read by as many software applications. The TIFF format
    is actually a container for several formats, so there’s no guarantee that all
    the features specified in an image will be properly handled by an application.
    JPEG is a better choice for most users, and if a lossless format is absolutely
    needed, PNG is a better choice than TIFF.'

    quality factor is large enough, these artifacts won’t be visible, even when the
    image is zoomed in substantially. But you should avoid repeatedly exporting an
    image in the JPEG format because the compression deterioration is cumulative.
    Also, note that setting the quality factor higher than when the image was loaded
    is pointless. Doing so only increases the file size without actually increasing
    the quality.

- en: Purchasing a printer is the first step in printing your images. There are many
    printer manufacturers and brands and an overwhelming number of different models.
    The price range is also huge, from less than $50 for the smallest and slowest
    ones to $15,000 and more for professional models that can print on three-foot-wide
    paper. There are also several printing techniques and a myriad of additional capabilities
    to choose from. Because this book is intended for general users, we consider only
    the printers intended for nonprofessional use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most common printing techniques are inkjet and laser. The least expensive
    color laser printers cost three to five times as much as the least expensive inkjet
    printers, but they’re much faster. On the other hand, low-cost inkjet printers
    generally produce much nicer images than laser printers in the same price range.
    You can also use glossier and heavier papers with an inkjet printer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you print mainly text or simple illustrations, and if you print a lot (say,
    several pages every day on the average), then a laser printer is probably the
    best choice. If you want to print mainly photographs and want a better quality
    output, then you should buy an inkjet printer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The major cost in printing is not the printer or the papers but the inks. A
    replacement set of all the inks used by a printer can cost as much as the printer
    itself, or even more. This cost model is the result of a rather underhanded business
    model. Printer manufacturers sell printers below their fabrication cost, but they
    sell ink cartridges well above their real cost. In fact, the inks they use are
    very cheap to manufacture, and a one-liter bottle in some countries costs the
    same as a 5 ml cartridge in other countries. Moreover, manufacturers have devised
    imaginative devices and tricks to prevent customers from using generic ink cartridges
    that would be 5 to 10 times cheaper.

    "Chapter 12. Color"). Because the colors are layered on a white paper, using a
    subtractive model makes sense. The CMY model isn’t enough because generating a
    good black color by mixing the three basic colors is almost impossible. A standard
    laser or inkjet printer, therefore, uses at least four different color cartridges:
    Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Inkjet printers designed for high-quality photo printing generally have more
    than four different inks. In addition to CMYK, they usually have a light Cyan
    and a light Magenta. More expensive printers may add a matte Black and a light
    Gray in order to replicate the qualities of the blacks and grays present in analog
    black and white photography.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The quality of the output paper is also important. You will get a much better
    result on glossy photo paper (which is unrelated to the analog photography process),
    but printing on glossy paper requires more ink and takes much longer. If you make
    several test prints in a rather large format, you can quickly empty the ink cartridges.

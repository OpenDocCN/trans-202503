    can be in multiple conditions—cocked or uncocked, with an empty or loaded chamber,
    with the safety on or off—and this can confuse less experienced users, somewhat
    increasing the likelihood of the gun not firing when needed or discharging when

    five or six rounds in a nonremovable cylinder that’s mechanically rotated with
    every pull of the trigger. Compared to semiautos, the interface of a revolver
    is simple and unlikely to confound a novice. On the other hand, the lower capacity
    of these firearms gives you fewer chances to land the decisive shot. The absence
    of removable magazines also means that reloading is slow and almost never attempted
    in the field.

    the energy of the fired cartridge, firing it may be less pleasant compared to
    a semiauto of the same chambering and weight. In a revolver, the bulk of the recoil
    is a single sharp impulse that goes straight into your wrists. That said, both
    revolvers and semiauto pistols can be chosen in a way that provides a comfortable
    shooting experience while still packing enough punch. This is done by matching
    the size of the weapon to the type of the cartridge and the physique of the shooter,

    fire projectiles with much greater energy than a pistol would. For rifles, the
    bulk of this increase has to do with speed, with bullets commonly traveling as
    fast as 3,000 feet per second (compared to handgun velocities around 1,000 ft/sec).
    For shotguns, the gains typically come from much heavier projectiles, weighing
    perhaps four to eight times as much as a 9mm round.

    a longer firearm is also easier to aim. Because of these factors, even a complete

    rifles vary quite considerably when it comes to mechanical operation. There are

    mechanism responsible for chambering new rounds extends in a straight line into
    the stock. Although this offers benefits, it makes the butt of the gun sit at
    a rather unnatural angle, requiring the optics to be mounted higher and the shooter
    to rubberneck a bit. Between the high-mounted optics and the protruding pistol
    grip, the AR-15 is also very tall, taking up a lot of space in any gun safe. Interestingly,
    this problem isn’t present on the FightLite SCR, which uses an angled mechanism
    and a traditional stock geometry while—again—retaining most of the other features
    of an AR-15.

    Although many shooters like to brag about how they can take the punishment in
    stride, the reality is that any extended range session will leave you sore—and
    if you don’t brace the gun perfectly, bruises are likely to follow too. Small-bore
    shotguns, capable of taking 20-gauge^([*](#c27-footnote-2)) or .410-caliber shotshells,
    are available on the market and are much easier to manage—but the choice of ammunition
    is far more constrained, and the reduction in power has obvious downsides.

    said, for shooters who want to take some edge off the recoil without tacking on
    an oversized shoulder pad, a semiautomatic shotgun can offer substantial relief;
    here, Remington V3 is probably the best pick in its class. The gotcha is that
    a semiauto may not cycle reliably with low-power shells, such as rubber baton
    rounds; the mechanism is factory-calibrated for conventional loads that pack far

    jacket (FMJ)* bullets are made of solid metal and tend to pass through soft materials
    without deforming to a significant extent. *Jacketed hollow point (JHP)* ammunition
    has a small cavity in the front of the bullet, sometimes filled back with plastic.
    On impact, the pressure inside this cavity rapidly builds up, causing the bullet
    to mushroom and decelerate.

    somewhat similarly to JHP.
  prefs: []

    lower cost. Hollow-point bullets are preferred for self-defense because they deliver
    their energy to the intended target more efficiently and are less likely to overpenetrate
    and hit bystanders. At the same time, because it’s reputed to cause more severe
    wounds, JHP ammunition is banned in some parts of the world. Still, where legal,
    it’s the more rational pick. However morbid this sounds, you don’t pull the trigger
    when you want to cause only a tiny bit of harm.

    shotshells: bird shot, buckshot, and slugs. *Bird shot* consists of hundreds of
    tiny metal spheres, traveling independently and meant to take out waterfowl and
    other critters. Bird shot is common in hunting but may not pack enough punch and
    not offer sufficient precision in self-defense situations that involve distances
    of more than perhaps 10 yards. *Buckshot* is a variation of this idea, consisting
    of a smaller number of much larger projectiles, each delivering about as much
    damage as a pistol round. When fired from the distance of about 10 to 15 yards,
    buckshot will impact an area roughly the size of the palm of your hand and will
    almost certainly kill anything in its path. Finally, *slugs* are single bullets
    of considerable size and mass. When they hit something, they punch a rather massive
    hole. They’re about as lethal as buckshot, but remain accurate and effective over
    longer distances—at the expense of requiring better aim.'

    it’s loaded. Many accidents happen because people trust their memory, their habits,
    or the assurances of others—but mistakes happen, and with a deadly tool, it’s
    essential to double-check. If you don’t know how to clear a particular gun of
    ammunition, it’s crucial to ask for help or check on the internet before messing
    with it. In semiautomatic firearms with removable magazines, always check the
    chamber *after* removing the mag. Removing the magazine alone isn’t a guarantee
    of safety. Although some firearms may be designed not to fire without a magazine,
    this isn’t universally true—and the interlock mechanism that ensures this property
    can malfunction too.'

    1, and it stipulates that when handling a gun, you should always keep it pointed
    somewhere safe. At the shooting range, this is toward the backstop. At home, the
    safest direction may be toward the ground. Accidentally muzzle-sweeping other
    people when manipulating a gun is a serious faux pas.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The third rule assumes that you might eventually break rules 1 and 2; it instructs
    you to keep your finger off the trigger until the gun is aimed at the target and
    you’re ready to fire. The simplest way to accomplish this is to rest your index
    finger on the frame or the stock of the firearm just above the trigger guard.
    This quickly becomes a habit. You can often spot gun owners by looking at how
    people hold a cordless drill, a sprayer bottle, or a similar household tool.

    things. During outdoor target practice, you may want to place the target against
    a hill or other natural feature that will stop any stray rounds. In self-defense

    to $1,000, the security gets more substantial: the products are designed to withstand

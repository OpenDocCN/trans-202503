    home to Hamilton. A lighthouse flashed. Flashed. Flashed. Flashed.

- en: 'The flashes didn’t carry any messages this night. The fog was too thick to
    send signals, so the Network was down. The powerful lights were needed for their
    original purpose: to warn boats away from dangerous rocks.'

  zh: 今晚的闪光灯没有传递任何信息。浓雾太厚，无法发送信号，所以网络无法使用。强力灯光被用来执行原本的任务：警告船只远离危险的岩石。

    exactly where it was supposed to be.

  zh: 事实是，只有一艘船在附近，它不需要任何警告。它正好在应该待的地方。
- en: The *Jargonaut* was the boat, and Kevin Kelvin was its captain. The boat was
    large and flat and plain. Near the front was a little cabin where Kelvin lived.
    The rest of the deck was taken up by a crane and a winch—a machine built to wind
    wire in or out. A wire led from the crane and into the water, looking like a large
    fishing pole. Belowdecks was mostly a hold for tons and tons of coiled wire.

  zh: '*贾格诺特号*是那艘船，凯文·凯尔文是它的船长。那艘船又大又平，外形简朴。船头有一个小舱室，凯文住在那里。船的其他部分被一台起重机和一台绞盘占据——这是一台用来卷起或放出电缆的机器。一根电缆从起重机延伸到水中，看起来像是一根巨大的钓鱼竿。船下层大多是用来存放成吨成吨的卷曲电缆的货舱。'
- en: It wouldn’t be accurate to say that the *Jargonaut* was a gigantic boat with
    a winch attached to it. That might give you the wrong impression. It would be
    better to describe it as a gigantic *winch* with a boat attached to it. Its entire
    purpose in life was to play out and wind up miles of heavy wire.

  zh: 如果说*贾格诺特号*是一艘附带绞盘的巨大船只，那样说可能不太准确。那可能会给你错觉。更准确的描述应该是：它是一台附带船只的巨大*绞盘*。它的全部目的就是放出和收回数英里的重型电缆。
- en: Inside the cabin, Kevin Kelvin rubbed his hands together to keep them warm.
    A thermometer hung from a peg near the door. It read a chilly 273\. *Brrrrr!*
    Now, 273 degrees might sound pretty hot to you and me, but this thermometer didn’t
    measure in degrees Fahrenheit or Celsius. It was on the Kelvin Scale, one of the
    captain’s many inventions. The Kelvin Scale starts at Absolute Zero, the coldest
    that any cold thing can possibly get. And 273 Kelvin isn’t much better. It’s about
    the temperature of an ice cube. *Brrrrr!*

  zh: 在船舱里，凯文·凯尔文搓着双手以保持温暖。门附近的墙上挂着一个温度计。它显示的是冷得令人发抖的273。*哆嗦！* 现在，273度可能对你我来说听起来相当热，但这个温度计并不是用华氏度或摄氏度来测量的。它使用的是凯尔文温标，这是船长的众多发明之一。凯尔文温标从绝对零度开始，即任何物体可以达到的最冷温度。而273凯尔文则更差。它大概是冰块的温度。*哆嗦！*
- en: The thermometer said a lot about the kind of person Kevin Kelvin was. He was
    a Composer, and a wickedly smart one. He never let a good idea escape without
    putting his name on it.

- en: When people asked Kelvin what he was doing, he would say he was fishing. He
    never explained what he was fishing *for*, in the middle of the night with a gigantic
    winch that had a boat attached to it. When people made jokes about catching sea
    monsters, Kelvin only smiled. No one knew what he knew. How could they?

  zh: 当人们问凯文在做什么时，他总是回答说他在钓鱼。他从不解释自己在夜深人静时用着一台巨大的绞盘，旁边还有一艘船，他究竟是在钓什么。每当人们开玩笑说他是在捕捉海怪时，凯文只是微笑着。没有人知道他知道的事情。怎么可能知道呢？
- en: Kevin Kelvin was fishing for teeny-tiny bits of electricity flowing up his Wire.
    The Wire traveled under the ocean for miles, all the way to a little building
    on the shore, not far from the lighthouse. He twiddled dials, and listened carefully
    to a nearby speaker connected to the Wire, and made notes. If his ideas were right,
    any moment now he should hear a signal from his assistant on the other end. It
    would sound like—

  zh: 凯文·凯尔文正在用他的电缆钓取微小的电流。这根电缆沿着海底延伸了数英里，直到岸边的一个小建筑物，离灯塔不远。他调节着旋钮，仔细听着连接到电缆的附近扬声器，并做着记录。如果他的推测没错，他应该很快就能听到他在另一端的助手发来的信号。它的声音应该是——

- en: 'The Wire worked! Just as Kelvin thought: he could send messages using electricity,
    even under miles of seawater. If the *Jargonaut* laid down a Wire all the way
    between two islands, that would form the first link in Kelvin’s very own Network.
    A Network that could send messages all the time, even on a terrible night like
    this. A Network that, someday, could even have *multiple Wires*.'

  zh: 电线奏效了！正如凯尔文所想：他可以利用电力发送信息，甚至在数英里的海水之下。如果*Jargonaut*在两座岛屿之间铺设了一根电线，这将构成凯尔文自己网络的第一个连接。一个能够随时发送信息的网络，即使在像今晚这样糟糕的夜晚也能运作。一个将来，甚至可能拥有*多条电线*的网络。

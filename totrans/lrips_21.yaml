- en: It was a dark and foggy night, many months after Lauren Ipsum had gone back
    home to Hamilton. A lighthouse flashed. Flashed. Flashed. Flashed.

- en: 'The flashes didn’t carry any messages this night. The fog was too thick to
    send signals, so the Network was down. The powerful lights were needed for their
    original purpose: to warn boats away from dangerous rocks.'

- en: As it happened, only one boat was around, and it didn’t need warning. It was
    exactly where it was supposed to be.

- en: The *Jargonaut* was the boat, and Kevin Kelvin was its captain. The boat was
    large and flat and plain. Near the front was a little cabin where Kelvin lived.
    The rest of the deck was taken up by a crane and a winch—a machine built to wind
    wire in or out. A wire led from the crane and into the water, looking like a large
    fishing pole. Belowdecks was mostly a hold for tons and tons of coiled wire.

- en: It wouldn’t be accurate to say that the *Jargonaut* was a gigantic boat with
    a winch attached to it. That might give you the wrong impression. It would be
    better to describe it as a gigantic *winch* with a boat attached to it. Its entire
    purpose in life was to play out and wind up miles of heavy wire.

- en: Inside the cabin, Kevin Kelvin rubbed his hands together to keep them warm.
    A thermometer hung from a peg near the door. It read a chilly 273\. *Brrrrr!*
    Now, 273 degrees might sound pretty hot to you and me, but this thermometer didn’t
    measure in degrees Fahrenheit or Celsius. It was on the Kelvin Scale, one of the
    captain’s many inventions. The Kelvin Scale starts at Absolute Zero, the coldest
    that any cold thing can possibly get. And 273 Kelvin isn’t much better. It’s about
    the temperature of an ice cube. *Brrrrr!*

    a Composer, and a wickedly smart one. He never let a good idea escape without
    putting his name on it.

- en: When people asked Kelvin what he was doing, he would say he was fishing. He
    never explained what he was fishing *for*, in the middle of the night with a gigantic
    winch that had a boat attached to it. When people made jokes about catching sea
    monsters, Kelvin only smiled. No one knew what he knew. How could they?

- en: Kevin Kelvin was fishing for teeny-tiny bits of electricity flowing up his Wire.
    The Wire traveled under the ocean for miles, all the way to a little building
    on the shore, not far from the lighthouse. He twiddled dials, and listened carefully
    to a nearby speaker connected to the Wire, and made notes. If his ideas were right,
    any moment now he should hear a signal from his assistant on the other end. It
    would sound like—

- en: 'The Wire worked! Just as Kelvin thought: he could send messages using electricity,
    even under miles of seawater. If the *Jargonaut* laid down a Wire all the way
    between two islands, that would form the first link in Kelvin’s very own Network.
    A Network that could send messages all the time, even on a terrible night like
    this. A Network that, someday, could even have *multiple Wires*.'

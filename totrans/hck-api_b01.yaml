    at least until the next technological advancement. We’ll probably never see the
    end of this undertaking. The popularity of APIs will continue to grow, and they’ll
    interact in new ways that expand the attack surface of every industry. The adversaries
    won’t stop either. If you don’t test an organization’s APIs, a cybercriminal somewhere
    will do it instead. (The main difference is that they won’t provide a report to
    improve anyone’s API security.)

<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="OpenerCap"><img src="Images/Alphabet-I.png" alt="Alphabet-I" class="dropcap" width="44" height="80"/></span>n the last chapter, you saw how computer games like <em>Pac-Man</em> have been used in ML development. Tic Tac Toe (also known as Noughts and Crosses, or Xs and Os) has been used to help people learn about ML for even longer. </p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="204" id="Page_204"/>For example, Donald Michie, a British AI researcher, designed <em>MENACE</em>, the <em>Machine Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine</em>, in 1960 (see <a id="figureanchor13-1" href="#figure13-1">Figure 13-1</a>). It was one of the first programs that was able to learn how to play Tic Tac Toe perfectly. MENACE was demonstrated using matchboxes and colored glass beads, and it is a good reminder that many of the principles behind ML have been developed over many decades.</p>

<p>Tic Tac Toe is not the only game that has been used to drive AI development, however. Chess is another good example. In Chapter 1, I mentioned Deep Blue, the IBM computer that beat the chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov. This followed decades of work to build computers that could play chess. As early as the 1950s, mathematician Alan Turing wrote a paper called “Digital Computers Applied to Games” in which he asked, “Could one make a machine to play chess, and to improve its play, game by game, profiting from its experience?”</p>
<p>In more recent years, the AI community has turned its attention to more complex games, like the board game <em>Go</em><em/>. Because of the huge number of potential moves and strategies in <em>Go</em>, it’s impossible to rely on the “brute-force” approach of computers like Deep Blue (which examine all possible future moves and positions). Google DeepMind’s computer AlphaGo achieved a milestone in AI research in 2016, when it defeated <em>Go</em> world champion Lee Sedol. </p>
<p>The tools for creating neural networks are getting easier to use, and our computers are becoming faster and more powerful, moving beyond the realms of AI students and researchers. If you do a <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="205" id="Page_205"/>web search for “Super Mario neural network,” you’ll find dozens of examples and tutorials of training ML models to play games like <em>Super Mario World</em>.</p>
<p>In this chapter, though, we’ll stick to the basics. We’ll be building a simplified version of Donald Michie’s MENACE design in Scratch and training an ML model to play Tic Tac Toe (see <a id="figureanchor13-2" href="#figure13-2">Figure 13-2</a>).</p>

<p>Let’s get started!</p>
<h2 id="h1-500563c13-0001">Build Your Project</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">You probably know how to play Tic Tac Toe already, but let’s quickly try it out in Scratch so we can plan how to introduce ML into it.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/scratch3/" class="LinkURL">https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk/scratch3/</a> and click <b>Project templates</b> in the top menu bar, as shown in <a id="figureanchor13-3" href="#figure13-3">Figure 13-3</a>.</p>
<p>In the list of templates, click <b>Noughts and Crosses</b>. The template loads a simple Tic Tac Toe game in Scratch. Click the Green Flag to give it a try.</p>
<p>You’re placing crosses (X) and the computer is placing noughts (O). The computer strategy isn’t very clever, but you’ll be making it more intelligent in this chapter. </p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" title="206" id="Page_206"/><figure>
<img src="Images/f13003.png" alt="f13003" width="676" height="401"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure13-3" href="#figureanchor13-3">Figure 13-3:</a> Access the project templates from the top menu. </p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Try to figure out the rules that the computer is following. The logic for where the computer moves next is all in the Code Area, so you can review the scripts there to see if you’re right. </p>
<p>There are many ways to represent the game board, but to start with we’ll use a very simple approach: numbering each of the cells on the board from 1 to 9, as shown in <a id="figureanchor13-4" href="#figure13-4">Figure 13-4</a>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Images/f13004.png" alt="f13004" width="405" height="385"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure13-4" href="#figureanchor13-4">Figure 13-4:</a> One approach to representing the game board is to number the cells. </p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The cells are also represented with numbers in the Scratch project template, as you can see in <a id="figureanchor13-5" href="#figure13-5">Figure 13-5</a>. </p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" title="207" id="Page_207"/><figure>
<img src="Images/f13005.png" alt="f13005" width="362" height="478"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure13-5" href="#figureanchor13-5">Figure 13-5:</a> Game board representation defined in the Scratch project template </p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We also need to describe the positions of the noughts and crosses on the board. We’ll want to be able to learn from whoever wins (whether it’s noughts or crosses who wins a game), so to keep things clear, we’ll use <em>player</em> to describe the winning moves and <em>opponent </em>to describe the losing moves.</p>
<p>For example, imagine that the board looked like <a id="figureanchor13-6" href="#figure13-6">Figure 13-6</a> early in a game that cross (X) ended up winning.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Images/f13006.png" alt="f13006" width="393" height="375"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure13-6" href="#figureanchor13-6">Figure 13-6:</a> An example game board state</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="208" id="Page_208"/>We can describe this board as follows:</p>
<table id="tabular-500563c13-0001" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Top left</td><td>Opponent</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Top middle</td><td>Player</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Top right</td><td>Opponent</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Middle left</td><td>Empty</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Middle middle</td><td>Empty</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Middle right</td><td>Empty</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Bottom left</td><td>Empty</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Bottom middle  </td><td>Empty</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Bottom right</td><td>Empty</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We want to train an ML model so that, given the state of a board like this, it can choose where to make the next move. To be able to do that, we’ll need training examples of decisions that led to a win. Each example will need to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>What the board looked like before a move</li>
<li>What move was made</li>
</ul>
<p>Training examples will be recorded only for moves made by the player that won that game. If you (cross) win the game, you want to train the model with the cross (X) moves. If the computer (nought) wins the game, you want to train it with the nought (O) moves.</p>
<h3 id="h2-500563c13-0001">Prepare Your Game</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">As with the <em>Pac-Man</em>–style game in the last chapter, the best way to collect training examples isn’t by typing them, but by playing the game yourself.</p>
<p>The first step is to prepare the training buckets where you’ll store examples of the moves you make. You will need nine training buckets: one for each possible choice available at any point in the game. </p>

I plotted the results in the bar chart shown in <a id="figureanchor13-27" href="#figure13-27">Figure 13-27</a>. Each column represents 10 games of Tic Tac Toe. Green represents games that I won. Orange represents games that ended in a tie. Red represents games won by the ML system.</p>
<p>The bar on the far left represents the first 10 games that I played. I won all 10 of them.</p>
<p>The next bar represents the next 10 games that I played. I won all 10 of those, too.</p>
<p>The bar on the far right represents the last 10 games that I played. I won 2 games, tied 4 games, and lost 4 games.</p>

<p>My first 10 games were very easy to win. The computer made foolish moves, and I didn’t have to try hard to win. By my last 10 games, however, it was harder to win. I had to concentrate and not make a single mistake to win a game. Although my feelings can’t be shown on the graph, it <em>felt</em> to me like the computer was getting better as I played. </p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="221" id="Page_221"/>Every ML project will go a little differently, so try training your own model and measuring how your project learns and improves. Hopefully you’ll see that the more training examples you collect, the better your ML model performs. But you’ll almost certainly see some variation in that, as I did. </p>
<h2 id="h1-500563c13-0002">Review and Improve Your Project</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">You created an ML system that learns to play Tic Tac Toe by competing against you. The biggest challenge with training the system yourself is the time it takes to play hundreds of training games. Are there more efficient ways to get more training examples?</p>
<p>One common way is to get more people to help. Imagine if, instead of playing the 300 games myself, I had saved my Scratch project and gave the project file to 30 friends and asked them to play 10 games each. Dividing the work would have made training much easier, as playing only 10 games would be very quick for each person.</p>
<p>Now imagine if I could get 300 people to help, or 3,000!</p>
<p>Hopefully you can see the benefits of spreading the work of training an ML model across a large number of people. This is sometimes described as <em>crowdsourcing</em>. There are some challenges with that, too, like being able to find a large group of people, coordinating them, explaining what you want to all of them, making sure they all do what you want and don’t train your ML model to do things you don’t want, and so on. But even so, using many people for training is still the best option for a lot of complicated projects.</p>
<h2 id="h1-500563c13-0003">What You Learned</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">In this chapter, you learned that Tic Tac Toe, or Noughts and Crosses, has been used to help people understand ML for decades. You trained an ML model to recognize numbers and built a Tic Tac Toe board with numbered cells representing each move. This project was based on the 1960 work of British AI researcher Donald Michie, who used matchboxes and glass beads in his MENACE project. Each matchbox represented a possible state of the game <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="222" id="Page_222"/>board, similar to the examples that you collected in your training data. The number of beads in the matchboxes was like the number of times an example shows up in one of the training buckets. </p>
<p>You also saw the importance of having lots of training examples to improve your ML model’s performance over time. Because the training set is updated with the winner’s moves after each game, the model gradually gets better and more difficult to beat. You learned that it can be useful to crowdsource, or share the work of training the model across a large group of people, to save yourself some time and effort. </p>
<p>In the next chapter, you’ll start to learn about how ML projects can go wrong.</p>

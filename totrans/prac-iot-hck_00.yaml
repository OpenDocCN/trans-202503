- en: Our dependence on connected technology is growing faster than our ability to
    secure it. The same technologies we know to be vulnerable, exposed to accidents
    and adversaries in our computer systems and enterprises, are now driving us to
    work, delivering patient care, and monitoring our homes. How can we reconcile
    our trust in these devices with their inherent lack of trustworthiness?

    of the digital era.” We need technically minded individuals to identify, report,
    and protect society from the harms that the internet-connected world causes. This
    work has never been more important, yet too few people have the necessary mind-set,
    skills, and tools.

- en: The IoT hacking field has a large breadth, and this book takes a practical approach
    to the topic. We focus on concepts and techniques that will get you started quickly
    with testing actual IoT systems, protocols, and devices. We specifically chose
    to demonstrate tools and susceptible devices that are affordable and easy to obtain
    so you can practice on your own.

    can download from the book’s website at [https://nostarch.com/practical-iot-hacking/](https://nostarch.com/practical-iot-hacking/).
    Some exercises are accompanied by virtual machines to make setting up the targets
    straightforward. In some chapters, we reference popular open source examples that
    you can readily find online.

- en: '*Practical IoT Hacking* isn’t a guide to IoT hacking tools, nor does it cover
    every aspect of IoT security, because these topics would take an even bigger book
    to cover, one much too cumbersome to read. Instead, we explore the most basic
    hardware hacking techniques, including interfacing with UART, I²C, SPI, JTAG,
    and SWD. We analyze a variety of IoT network protocols, focusing on those that
    aren’t only important, but also haven’t been extensively covered in other publications.
    These include UPnP, WS-Discovery, mDNS, DNS-SD, RTSP/RTCP/RTP, LoRa/LoRaWAN, Wi-Fi
    and Wi-Fi Direct, RFID and NFC, BLE, MQTT, CDP, and DICOM. We also discuss real-world
    examples that we’ve encountered in past professional testing engagements.'

- en: No two people share identical backgrounds and experience. Yet analyzing IoT
    devices requires skills spanning nearly every domain of expertise, because these
    devices combine computing power and connectivity into every facet of our world.
    We can’t predict which parts of this book each person will find the most compelling.
    But we believe that making this knowledge available to a broad population gives
    them power to have greater control over their increasingly digitizing world.

    required to follow along in this book, you can also refer to supplementary hardware
    hacking material, such as the *The Hardware Hacking Handbook* by Colin O’Flynn
    and Jasper van Woudenberg (No Starch Press, forthcoming). We recommend additional

    for penetration testing. Kali comes with a variety of command line tools, all
    of which we’ll explain in detail as we use them in the book. That said, if you
    don’t know your way around the operating system, we recommend reading *Linux Basics
    for Hackers* by OccupyTheWeb (No Starch Press, 2019) and exploring the material
    at [https://kali.org/](https://kali.org/), including its free course at [https://kali.training/](https://kali.training/).

    The version you use shouldn’t matter as long as it’s up to date, however, please
    keep in mind that we tested most of the exercises for rolling Kali versions between
    2019 and 2020\. You can try out older images of Kali at [http://old.kali.org/kali-images/](http://old.kali.org/kali-images/)
    if you have trouble installing any particular tool. Newer versions of Kali will
    by default not have all the tools installed, but you can add them through the
    `kali-linux-large` metapackage. Enter the following command in a terminal to install
    the metapackage:'

- en: The book has 15 chapters loosely split between five parts. For the most part,
    the chapters are independent from each other, but you might encounter references
    to tools or concepts in later chapters that we introduced in earlier ones. For
    that reason, although we wrote the book trying to keep most chapters self-contained,
    we recommend reading it in sequential order.

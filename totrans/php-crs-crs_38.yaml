- en: While it’s possible to do PHP development in the cloud, many programmers and
    students prefer to have PHP installed on their local computer. This appendix goes
    through the steps to install PHP for macOS, Linux, and Windows computer systems.

- en: The easiest way to install PHP on macOS is to use Homebrew, a free package manager
    that greatly simplifies installing and setting up software packages. If you don’t
    already have it, first install Homebrew by visiting *[https://brew.sh](https://brew.sh)*
    and following the instructions there.

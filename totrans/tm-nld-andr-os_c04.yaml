    months earlier, things weren’t quite as rosy. In January of that year, the startup
    was desperate for cash and their main task was the same as for most startups:
    getting funding. After the pivot from a camera OS to an open source phone platform,
    they still had the daunting task of actually building a product, which meant they’d
    need more money to hire a large enough team to do the work.'

    was possible. Next, they needed to articulate their vision and create a pitch
    deck to help explain that vision. Finally, they needed to take the demo and the
    slide deck on the road to pitch their story to potential investors.

    system that Swetland and Chris had been working on. It wasn’t actually functional
    (for example, it showed a stock ticker on the home screen which used a set of
    hard-coded symbols and stale data). But the demo represented a vision of what
    the product could be when it was actually implemented.

    markets. In 2004, there were 178 million shipments of PCs worldwide. During the

    The cost of hardware was going down, but that of software was not, making it a
    larger and larger proportion of the per-handset cost. But handset manufacturers
    were not experts in software platform development and didn’t have the skill set
    or interest in providing the increasing capabilities required to differentiate
    their software from that of their competitors.

- en: The second major point in the pitch deck was that there was a gap, and an opportunity,
    in the market for an *open* platform. That is, Android would be an operating system
    that was free and available to manufacturers through open source. Companies would
    be able to use and distribute this OS on their own phones, without being beholden
    to a software provider and without having to build it themselves. This open approach
    was something that was simply not available at that time.

    port to their hardware. Symbian was primarily used by Nokia, with some uptake
    from Sony and Motorola. RIM had its own platform, which it used only for its own
    BlackBerry devices. But there was no alternative out there for manufacturers that
    wanted a capable smartphone without either building their own OS, putting significant
    effort into customizing an existing one, and/or paying a high licensing fee.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even more problematic, the systems that were available failed to provide an
    ecosystem for applications. Symbian provided some of the core infrastructure for
    an operating system, but the UI layer was left as an exercise for the manufacturer,
    resulting in an application model for phones where apps written for one flavor
    of Symbian wouldn’t necessarily run on some other variation, even on phones from
    the same manufacturer.

    once, run anywhere,” could possibly have provided this kind of cross-device application
    capability, but Java ME^([1](#c04-footnote-1)) fell far short of this in the mobile
    space. While it did provide at least the same language across devices (much as
    Symbian provided the same language of C++ for all of its implementations), Java
    ME addressed the wide variety of form factors and architectures in phones by providing
    different versions of the platform, called *profiles*. These profiles had different
    capabilities, so developers needed to change their applications to run on different
    devices, and often that approach failed when capabilities were drastically different
    across devices.

    based on the Linux OS kernel. All manufacturers needed was Linux itself, reference
    hardware from TI, and then a huge host of other modules that manufacturers had
    to acquire, license, build, or otherwise supply to create their own device. As
    Brian Swetland put it, “You could use TI’s OMAP^([2](#c04-footnote-2)) chips to
    build a Linux phone. So you needed TI’s OMAP and then forty components from forty
    different vendors of middleware. You put all these together and you integrated
    them all and then you’d have a Linux phone. And that was just absurd.”

    solution. It would be built on Linux, like TI’s offering but would also provide
    all of the necessary pieces so that manufacturers would have only one system to
    adopt in order to build and ship their devices. Android would also provide a single
    programming model to application developers, so that their apps would work the
    same across all devices on which the platform ran. By having a single platform
    that worked across all devices using it, Android would simplify phones for both
    manufacturers and developers.

    pitching to) was how Android was going to make money. The open source platform
    described in the slides is essentially what the Android team eventually built
    and shipped. But if that was all there was, the company would not have been worth
    funding for VCs. Developing and giving away an open source platform sounds great
    from a save-the-world standpoint, but where’s the payoff? Where’s the upside for
    investors? That is, how did Android plan to make money off of a product that they
    planned to simply give away? Venture capitalists fund companies that they hope
    will make more (far more) than their investment back.

    Microsoft made money by licensing its platform to Windows Phone partners; every
    phone sold contributed a per-device cost back to Microsoft. RIM made money both
    on the handsets they sold as well as the lucrative service contracts that their
    loyal enterprise customers signed up for. Nokia and the other Symbian adopters
    made money by selling the phones that they manufactured with variations of that
    operating system. Similarly, all of the other handset manufacturers funded their
    own software development through the revenue generated by the phones they sold.

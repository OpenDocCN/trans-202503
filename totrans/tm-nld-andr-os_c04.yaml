    months earlier, things weren’t quite as rosy. In January of that year, the startup
    was desperate for cash and their main task was the same as for most startups:
    getting funding. After the pivot from a camera OS to an open source phone platform,
    they still had the daunting task of actually building a product, which meant they’d
    need more money to hire a large enough team to do the work.'

    in the market for an *open* platform. That is, Android would be an operating system
    that was free and available to manufacturers through open source. Companies would
    be able to use and distribute this OS on their own phones, without being beholden

- en: Microsoft provided a proprietary OS that manufacturers could license and then
    port to their hardware. Symbian was primarily used by Nokia, with some uptake
    from Sony and Motorola. RIM had its own platform, which it used only for its own
    BlackBerry devices. But there was no alternative out there for manufacturers that
    wanted a capable smartphone without either building their own OS, putting significant
    effort into customizing an existing one, and/or paying a high licensing fee.

- en: Even more problematic, the systems that were available failed to provide an
    ecosystem for applications. Symbian provided some of the core infrastructure for
    an operating system, but the UI layer was left as an exercise for the manufacturer,
    resulting in an application model for phones where apps written for one flavor
    of Symbian wouldn’t necessarily run on some other variation, even on phones from
    the same manufacturer.

    capability, but Java ME^([1](#c04-footnote-1)) fell far short of this in the mobile
    space. While it did provide at least the same language across devices (much as
    Symbian provided the same language of C++ for all of its implementations), Java
    ME addressed the wide variety of form factors and architectures in phones by providing
    different versions of the platform, called *profiles*. These profiles had different
    capabilities, so developers needed to change their applications to run on different
    devices, and often that approach failed when capabilities were drastically different

    programming model to application developers, so that their apps would work the

  zh: 从韩国，团队飞往台湾，与HTC的首席执行官周永明会面。尼克回忆起这次会议：“周永明提到关于我们第一款设备的独占性，这被布赖恩听到了。当我们回到酒店房间时，斯威特兰威胁要辞职，因为‘我加入Android不是为了变成另一个Danger。’^([7](#c04-footnote-7))
    我很担心，因为布赖恩对我们的成功至关重要，但第二天见到他时，一切都没问题。”
- en: The team continued pitching to VCs and found some success. Charles River Ventures
    and Eagle River Holdings were both interested. While they were waiting on paperwork
    from those firms, Google called them in for a third meeting.

  zh: 团队继续向风险投资公司推介并取得了一些成功。Charles River Ventures和Eagle River Holdings都表现出兴趣。就在他们等待这些公司的文件时，谷歌邀请他们进行第三次会议。
- en: This time, there were more people in the room, and Google was ready to talk
    specifics. Andy and his team had assumed they were coming to give an update on
    the company’s progress since the last meeting. But in the middle of the presentation,
    Nick remembered, “They just said, ‘Let us interrupt you there. We just want to
    buy you.’”

  zh: 这次，房间里有更多的人，Google准备好讨论具体细节了。安迪和他的团队原本以为他们是来更新自上次会议以来公司进展的。但在展示过程中，尼克记得，“他们只是说，‘让我们打断一下。我们只是想收购你们。’”
- en: 'Google turned what Andy’s team thought was a meeting of Android pitching to
    Google into a meeting in which Google was pitching to them instead. Google said
    if Android allowed itself to be acquired, it would do much better than it would
    otherwise. Instead of having to deal with the requirements of venture capitalists
    and having to charge customers and carriers for specialized services, they could
    just give the OS away to the carriers for free. In fact, it would be even better
    than free: Google had revenue from search that they might be able to share with
    carriers. So rather than having to sell carriers on something, they’d be able
    to form partnerships with them. Nick remembered that it was a powerful argument
    for getting carriers on board: “We were actually going to help them *make* money
    by doing a partnership deal with us.”'

  zh: Google将安迪团队认为是Android向Google推销的会议，转变为Google向他们推销的会议。Google表示，如果Android愿意被收购，它将比原本独立发展时做得更好。Android不需要再应对风险投资者的要求，也不必向客户和运营商收取专业服务费，他们可以直接将操作系统免费提供给运营商。事实上，这甚至比免费还要好：Google通过搜索获得的收入，可能可以与运营商共享。因此，他们不再需要向运营商推销某些东西，而是可以与运营商建立合作伙伴关系。尼克记得，这是一个说服运营商加入的有力论点：“我们实际上是在通过与我们达成合作伙伴协议来帮助他们*赚钱*。”
- en: The team from Android was game for joining Google, but there were still many
    details to be figured out. In the meantime, in mid-April, they got term sheets
    from both Eagle River and Charles River and decided to go with the Eagle River
    deal. The Google deal was far from final, but had entered negotiations in early
    May, so they added a carve-out^([8](#c04-footnote-8)) in the term sheet, to account
    for the possibility that they’d do something with Google instead.

  zh: Android团队愿意加入Google，但仍有许多细节需要解决。与此同时，在四月中旬，他们收到了来自Eagle River和Charles River的条款清单，并决定选择Eagle
    River的交易。Google的交易距离最终确定还很远，但在五月初已进入谈判阶段，因此他们在条款清单中添加了一个 carve-out^([8](#c04-footnote-8))，以应对他们可能会与Google达成协议的情况。

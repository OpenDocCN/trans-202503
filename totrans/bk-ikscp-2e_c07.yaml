- en: As a sequel to the previous chapter on transformation, let's look at how Inkscape
    allows you not only to transform objects freely but to do it quickly, precisely,
    and, to some extent, automatically. The two main approaches are snapping and arranging.

- en: '*Snapping* refers to making some points, lines, or paths work as magnets, so
    that when you are moving something in the vicinity of such a magnetic attractor,
    the thing you''re moving "snaps" into the exact desired position. *Arranging*
    moves a large number of objects in a regular way so that they are aligned, distributed,
    scattered, or lined up into a grid exactly as you want them to be.'

- en: 'The easiest way to snap objects into alignment is by creating a guide (guideline).*Guides*
    are visible, infinitely long straight lines on the canvas that you can use for
    alignment and snapping. Guides are not objects: they cannot be selected, they
    don''t print, and they don''t show up on bitmap exports. Although they are saved
    with the document, they are not part of the SVG standard and are invisible in
    SVG viewers other than Inkscape. They are just Inkscape-specific helpers for organizing
    your artwork.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, guides may separate parts of your layout, helping you visualize
    the edges of various areas or cells. A guide can be a centerline so you can draw
    symmetrically around it. Or you can use a guide to verify whether objects are
    really aligned or just look like they are.
  prefs: []

- en: To create a guide manually, the canvas rulers must be visible; if they're hidden,
    display them with Ctrl-R. Click anywhere on a ruler and, without releasing the
    mouse, drag your cursor out to the canvas. A new guide appears that you can now
    drop (by releasing the mouse) where you want it. Naturally, dragging off the horizontal
    ruler creates *horizontal guides*, and dragging off the vertical ruler creates*vertical
    guides*; what's more interesting, dragging from the very ends of the rulers creates
    *diagonal guides*, slanted (by default) at 45 degrees, as shown in [Figure 7-1](#fig7-1).

    notice that it becomes red, which means it's now grabbable. Click and drag the

    a ruler and drop it there, or hover and press Delete while it is red.

    is the vertical pipe character, usually on the same key as the \ but requiring
    Shift). This key hides the guides without deleting anything; if you press | again
    (or try to create a new guideline), all hidden guidelines will be displayed again.
    This key controls both guide visibility and snapping to guides (so there's no
    snapping to invisible guides); if you want to disable snapping without hiding
    the guides, use the % key (the global snapping toggle, [7.3](#section7.3)).

    certain limits independent of zoom. As you zoom out, the lines get closer to each
    other—but then Inkscape weeds the grid by showing only every tenth grid line.
    Such decimation of grid lines happens again and again as you zoom out so as to
    keep the grid display reasonable. Inversely, as you zoom in, Inkscape reveals
    more and more grid lines so as to fill your screen evenly.

    For example, if you plan to snap a corner of a rectangle, simply grab the rectangle
    near this corner for dragging—then the three other corners will not get in your
    way. This reduces "snapping noise" that may get very distracting in complex documents.

    Only snap the node closest to the pointer option described above: now, among all

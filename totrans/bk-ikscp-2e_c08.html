			</header>
			<p class="ChapterIntro"><a id="139"/>Now that you know all about selecting and
transforming objects, let's start a new
topic that will entertain us for the next several
chapters: styling. The way an object in an Inkscape
document looks is determined by that object's <em>style</em>,
which consists of separate <em>properties</em>. To use Inkscape, you need to be 
familiar with at least some of the style properties and the tools for editing them.</p>
			<p>
				In this chapter, I describe the most basic style properties, including the 
common types of <em>paint</em> (used for fill and stroke) and <em>opacity</em>. After this, <a href="c09.xhtml#ch9">Chapter 9</a> covers stroke style, <a href="c10.xhtml#ch10">Chapter 10</a> deals with gradients, meshes, and
patterns, and <a href="c15.xhtml#ch15">Chapter 15</a> describes text style properties. Filter effects, such as
blur, are also part of an object's style; I discuss those in <a href="c17.xhtml#ch17">Chapter 17</a>.</p>
			<p>
				One style-related command worth knowing before all others is <span class="ui">Edit<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Paste Style</span>
(Shift-Ctrl-V). It takes the complete style of the object you last copied to the
clipboard and applies it to all selected objects. You’ll often want some objects to be mostly, but not completely,
identical in style. It’s much easier to paste the same style on all of them first and then
change only the properties that need to be different.
Also, you've already seen how to
search objects by style properties (<a href="c05.xhtml#section5.13">5.13</a>) and how to select objects with the same style as
the selected object (<a href="c05.xhtml#section5.12">5.12</a>).</p>

				8.1 <a id="140"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_140" title="140"/>Style Properties and Selectors <span class="NoteHead">[1.1]</span></h2>
			<p>Inkscape has many dialogs, commands, and tools that deal with objects' style;
you're probably already using some of them. However, before looking at any specific
style properties or tools, let's talk a bit about how style is encoded in SVG. If you're
not interested in the technical details, feel free to skip this section.</p>
			<p>
				The way object style is recorded in the SVG code of a document is not
defined by the SVG standard; for this purpose, SVG reuses another standard
called <em>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</em>. You are probably familiar with CSS if you ever did any kind of HTML coding because HTML also uses CSS.
(SVG uses only a subset of CSS; refer to the SVG standard at <a href="http://w3.org/TR/SVG">http://w3.org/TR/SVG</a> as well as to <a href="b01.xhtml#chA">Appendix A</a> for
details.)</p>
			<p>
				In CSS, a style is a collection of named <em>properties</em>. Each property has its own rules for what values it
can take. If you've ever browsed objects in Inkscape's XML editor (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.10">4.10</a>), you probably noticed that the <code>style</code> attribute
is present on most objects, and it looks like a list of <code>name:value</code> pairs separated by semicolons.
Each of these pairs defines a property. Example properties are <code>fill</code>, which specifies the fill paint (<a href="#section8.2">8.2</a>),<code>stroke-width</code> for stroked paths, or <code>font-family</code> for text objects.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">

					<h2>CSS Properties as XML Attributes</h2>
					<p>
						Technically, a property also can be saved in an attribute of its own, instead of being lumped together with all other properties
in the <code>style</code> attribute. Inkscape can read such SVG as well, but
when it changes the file it moves the properties to the <code>style</code> attribute.</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>
				If you want to edit style at the level of CSS properties, the XML Editor is not very convenient. A specialized tool for editing style is the<span class="ui">Selectors and CSS</span> dialog (Ctrl-Shift-Q), shown in <a href="#fig8-1">Figure 8-1</a>. Here, you can not only
edit the properties of objects, but also create <em>selectors</em>—styles that apply to more than one object so that
you can update all of them at once.</p>
			<a id="fig8-1"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="09/css-selectors.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 8-1: The <span class="ui">Selectors and CSS</span> dialog showing the style of the selected object and the
selectors defined in the document</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The dialog's first half (you can arrange the two areas of the dialog vertically or side-by-side) deals with the selected object. Even if you
don't use any of the advanced features, here you can conveniently edit all of the properties of the selected object's style. Inkscape
will prompt you with available property names and will validate the value you type. The <span class="ui">+</span> button at the top of the list adds a new
property; the x in the red circle next to a property deletes it.</p>
			<p>
				The magic starts when you click the <span class="ui">+</span> button in the bottom left corner of the dialog. This creates a new <em>selector</em>, and you are
prompted to give it a name. You can think of a selector as similar to a CSS class: a collection of elements and a style that applies to all of them.
Initially, only the selected object is in the selector, and that selector has no style properties of its own. To add more objects
to the selector, select them and click the <span class="ui">+</span> button next to the selector you want to apply.</p>
			<p><a id="141"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_141" title="141"/>One object can belong to more than one selector; for example, in <a href="#fig8-1">Figure 8-1</a>, <code>text759</code> (each object is
identified by its <code>id</code> attribute, <a href="c04.xhtml#section4.1">4.1</a>) is included in the <code>texts</code> and <code>grays</code> selectors.
By the way, when you click a selector's name in the dialog, its objects become selected on canvas—this makes this dialog
useful for "storing" complex selections even if you don't use selector styling.</p>
			<p>
				To add style properties to a selector, select any object included in it and click yet another <span class="ui">+</span> button next to the
selector's name in the top (or left) part of the dialog that deals with the object's style. Any value you provide here
will apply to all objects in this selector, overriding any value they may have for the same property in their individual
styles. In <a href="#fig8-1">Figure 8-1</a>, the <code>texts</code> selector has the property <code>font-family: 'times new roman'</code>
and the <code>grays</code> selector contains <code>fill: #a9a9a9</code> (gray color). The selected object<code>text759</code>, being included in both these selectors, has both gray color and the Times New Roman font.</p>

			<h2>8.2 Paint</h2>
			<p>
				As you probably already know, objects can have <em>fill</em> and <em>stroke</em>, which have some kind of <em>paint</em> applied to them.
One could say that an object is filled by one paint and stroked by another. A paint may be of several different types.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><a id="142"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_142" title="142"/>None (no paint)
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						An object with its fill set to <code>none</code> has only stroke, and
an object with its stroke set to <code>none</code> has only fill. If both fill and stroke are <code>none</code>, the
object is completely invisible (and cannot be selected by clicking, <a href="c05.xhtml#section5.4">5.4</a>), just as it would be with zero opacity.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Flat color</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This is the most common type of paint: a plain solid color. Later in this chapter, you'll see many ways to view
and change the fill and stroke colors.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>
					Gradient, gradient mesh, <span class="rm">or</span> pattern
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Both fill and stroke may have various types of
smooth color gradients, gradient meshes, or repeating patterns. These complex paint
types are the subject of a separate chapter (<a href="c10.xhtml#ch10">Chapter 10</a>).</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Swatch</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						A swatch is a flat color that you can assign (as fill or stroke paint) to more than one object, so that when you
edit it, all objects with that swatch update. A swatch belongs to the document in which it was created and is saved
with it. Swatches are created and edited in the <span class="ui">Fill and Stroke</span> dialog, but they are also listed, and can be applied from,
the <span class="ui">Auto</span> palette (<a href="#section8.5.1">8.5.1</a>). This feature is still somewhat clumsy to use; also, in SVG a swatch is encoded
as a fake one-stop gradient, which is not very natural. If you need reusable style, I recommend using
CSS selectors instead (<a href="#section8.1">8.1</a>).</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Unset</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						This means that a fill or stroke is <em>not specified</em>, and
therefore may be <em>inherited</em> from an object's ancestors (those above it in the document's XML tree); this is not the same as<code>none</code> (which simply forces invisibility). If an object's ancestors
have no stroke or fill of their own (as is usually the case for groups or layers),
an object with unset fill or stroke will get the SVG defaults: an invisible stroke and a solid black fill.  Unsetting is
useful with clones (<a href="c16.xhtml#ch16">Chapter 16</a>) because it allows you to create clones
painted differently from their originals.</p>

					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>
						A path need not be closed in order to be filled; unclosed paths (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.1.1">12.1.1</a>) can
still be filled as if their ends were connected by an unstroked straight line segment.</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">

				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>
				The main tool for editing an object's style, the <span class="ui">Fill and Stroke</span> dialog
(Shift-Ctrl-F), has a number of buttons on its <span class="ui">Fill</span> and <span class="ui">Stroke paint</span>
tabs that correspond to the different paint types. The pressed button indicates the
current paint type of the selected object; if multiple objects with different paint
types are selected, no button is pressed and the dialog says <span class="ui">Multiple styles</span>.</p>
			<p>
				Another important control is the <em>selected style indicator</em> (<a href="c02.xhtml#section2.8">2.8</a>) in the
status bar. Always present onscreen, it lets you quickly look up the paint type of the selected object, as well as change
it via the right-click menu: right-click the fill swatch at the <em>top</em> to change the <em>fill</em> paint and the
stroke swatch at the <em>bottom</em> to change <em>stroke</em> paint (<a href="#fig8-2">Figure 8-2</a>).</p>

			</figure>
			<p><a id="143"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_143" title="143"/>One important property that applies only to fill but
not stroke is the <em>fill rule</em>. It may take one of two values. The value of<code>evenodd</code> means that <em>any</em> self-intersections or inside subpaths (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.1.1">12.1.1</a>) create
holes in the fill of a path. The value of <code>nonzero</code> means that most holes
are covered with fill; more precisely, if the inner subpath has the same direction as
the outer one, the hole will be painted, and otherwise it will be a hole without paint.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>
						Some of the inner subpaths can still produce holes even with <code>nonzero</code> fill
rule. This depends on the direction of the subpath (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.1.1">12.1.1</a>): if it is counterdirected
relative to the outer path, the hole will remain unfilled.</p>

			<dl>
				<dt>Bitmaps</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Bitmap objects (<a href="c18.xhtml#ch18">Chapter 18</a>) cannot have either fill or stroke. However, you can convert a
bitmap into a rectangular path filled by that bitmap as a pattern (just press Alt-I), which can then have a
stroke applied to it.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Groups</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						You would rarely want to assign fill or stroke to a group by itself,
because the objects inside a group usually have their own paint and ignore what is set
on their parent group. In fact, if you try to set a fill or stroke on a group in Inkscape, it will set
it on the group but will <em>also</em> assign it recursively to all the group's members.  Only explicitly <em>unset</em> fills or
strokes of the group's members will be left alone; however, they will inherit the new fill or stroke
from their ancestor anyway.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Clones</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						If you try to set fill or stroke on a clone (<a href="c16.xhtml#ch16">Chapter 16</a>), it won't have a
visible effect unless the original of that clone has its fill or stroke<em>unset</em>.</p>
				</dd>
			</dl><a id="section8.3"/>
			<h2>8.3 Opacity</h2>
			<p>
				On top of the fill or stroke paint, an object may have <em>opacity</em> that you can edit in the <span class="ui">O:</span> field in
the status bar or with the <span class="ui">Opacity</span> slider in the <span class="ui">Fill and Stroke</span>
dialog. Just like filters (<a href="c17.xhtml#ch17">Chapter 17</a>), opacity applies to the entire object without any
distinction between fill and stroke.</p>
			<p>
				In fact, in
SVG an object can have three kinds of opacity: <em>master opacity</em> (which is called
simply <em>opacity</em> in most places in the UI as well as in this book), <em>fill
opacity</em>, and <em>stroke opacity</em> (<a href="#fig8-4">Figure 8-4</a>). The two latter kinds apply only to fill or
stroke, respectively, and while Inkscape allows you to view and change them, it
generally discourages them in favor of master opacity. Situations where you might need
your stroke opaque but fill transparent or vice versa are not too frequent in practice;
in most cases, master opacity is more natural and easier to use.</p>
			<a id="fig8-4"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="09/fsopacity.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 8-4: Fill opacity, stroke opacity, and master opacity</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="145"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_145" title="145"/>One consequence of lowering stroke opacity is that you can see the fringe of the object's
fill, normally obscured by its own stroke. Per SVG rules, stroke is normally drawn on top
of fill (in the object's own internal z-order; however, see <a href="c09.xhtml#section9.6">9.6</a>), and fill is bounded by the midline of the
stroke, so with a semitransparent stroke, you will see three distinct boundaries: the
outer boundary of the stroke, the stroke's midline where its fill starts, and the inner
boundary of the stroke where it overlaps the fill.</p>
			<p>
				Master opacity, unlike stroke opacity, has no such problems—it applies to the
object as a whole, without revealing any untidy fringe. In the same way, when applied
to a group, it makes the group transparent as a whole, which may be different from the
same level of opacity assigned to individual objects in the group (<a href="c04.xhtml#fig4-10">Figure 4-10</a>).</p>
			<p>Also, unlike fill or stroke opacity, master opacity is applicable to objects that
have no fill or stroke of their own, such as bitmaps and most clones.</p>

					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p><em>Opacity</em> and <em>transparency</em>
look at the same thing from opposite angles: when an object's opacity is zero, it
is fully transparent; conversely, when its transparency is zero, it is fully opaque. 
Another synonym for opacity that you may encounter is <em>alpha</em>.</p>

			<h2>8.4 Color Models</h2>
			<p>
				The most important building block of style is <em>color</em>. A discussion of
how color is represented on computers could easily fill a book; Inkscape may not be the most
powerful color program out there, but it is nevertheless quite rich and complex in this
area.</p>
			<p>
				When working with color, the first step is to choose the <em>color model</em>.
Inkscape supports several popular color models that represent the same color differently.</p>
			<a id="section8.4.1"/><h3>8.4.1 RGB</h3>
			<p>
				In the most common color model, <em>RGB</em>, every color
is represented as a mix of red, green, and blue components or <em>channels</em>.
This model is implemented by nearly all computer displays (which are
typically composed of tiny light sources of these three colors) and is the primary color
model used in SVG as well as most other computer graphic formats.</p>
			<p>Depending on the software you use, the value of each of the three channels in an RGB
color may be either a fractional number between 0 and 1 (such as 0.5) or an integer
between 0 and 255 (such as 127). These two systems are equivalent; for example, a
color with R = 0, G = 0.5, B = 1.0 is the
same as R = 0, G = 127, B = 255. Inkscape normally uses
the 0–255 integer format, which I also prefer in this book; however, in some
parts of the Inkscape UI you will see a choice between the integer and the fractional formats.</p>
			<p>In RGB, higher values of the channels make the color lighter, and lower values make it
darker. Thus, RGB 0/0/0 is pure black and RGB 255/255/255 is pure white.
Any RGB color where the
values of all channels are equal is a shade of gray; making the channels unequal adds
saturation to the color, and the bigger the inequality, the greater the saturation. So
colors such as pure red (RGB 255/0/0) or pure yellow (RGB 255/255/0) have maximum possible
saturation.</p>
			<p><a id="146"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_146" title="146"/>The <span class="ui">Fill and Stroke</span> dialog lets you edit colors in RGB using either numeric
input fields or sliders that move within graduated-color
grooves (see <a id="figref2"/><a href="c15b.xhtml#ill-fig2">Figure 2 in the color insert</a>). Note that the colors of the grooves change as you move the sliders; each groove
shows you the colors that you will get by moving the slider within it if the other
sliders remain where they are. The fourth slider at the bottom, labeled <span class="ui">A</span>
(alpha), represents the fill or stroke opacity (and thus is not, strictly speaking, part
of the color).</p>
			<p>
				An RGB color is often expressed as a string in the form <code>RRGGBB</code>
where each of the three components is represented by a two-digit hexadecimal (base 16, instead
of the conventional base 10) number. Hexadecimal numbers can use digits <code>0</code> through <code>9</code> and
letters <code>A</code> through <code>F</code>. The maximum integer value of a channel—<code>255</code> in decimal—is<code>FF</code> in hexadecimal. For example, <code>000000</code> is black,<code>FFFFFF</code> is white, <code>660000</code> is dark red. This form of representing
colors is used in the SVG source of Inkscape documents, as well as in a lot of other
software and languages (such as HTML). For example, when you choose <span class="ui">Copy color</span> from the
right-click menu of the fill or stroke swatch in the selected style indicator (<a href="#fig8-2">Figure 8-2</a>),
the <code>RRGGBB</code> representation of the color is copied to the clipboard. Also, you can view and edit an<code>RRGGBBAA</code> representation (with two more digits appended for the
fill/stroke opacity) in the <span class="ui">RGBA</span> field in the <span class="ui">Fill
and Stroke</span> dialog.</p>
			<p>
				If multiple objects are selected that have different fill or stroke colors, both
the <span class="ui">Fill and Stroke</span> dialog and the selected style indicator display the <em>averaged
color</em>. If you change that averaged color, it will be assigned back to all the selected
objects, in effect flattening any color differences those objects might have had, as shown in <a href="#fig8-5">Figure 8-5</a>.</p>

					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>

						This averaging is done in RGB—that is, the averaged color's R, G, and B channels
are the arithmetic mean of the corresponding channels in the input colors. The same
averaging formula, per SVG rules, is used in gradients for interpolating between stop
colors (<a href="c10.xhtml#section10.2">10.2</a>).</p>

			</aside>
			<a id="section8.4.2"/>
			<h3>8.4.2 CMYK and CMS</h3>
			<p>
				Similar to RGB, in the <em>CMYK</em> model a color is obtained by mixing color
channels. However, CMYK has not three but four channels: <em>cyan</em>, <em>magenta</em>,<em>yellow</em>, and <em>black</em> (see <a id="figref3"/><a href="c15b.xhtml#ill-fig3">Figure 3 in the color insert</a>). This color model is best suited for printed output
because many professional printers and printing presses use CMYK.
However, even when you specify a
color in CMYK, what gets written into SVG is its RGB approximation, and conversion from CMYK
to RGB and back typically introduces distortions because not all CMYK
colors can be exactly represented in RGB and vice versa.</p>

					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p><a id="147"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_147" title="147"/>Traditionally, numeric values of CMYK channels are in the range of

				The <span class="ui">CMS</span> (Color Management System) tab of the <span class="ui">Fill and Stroke</span> dialog allows you
to edit colors in a <em>calibrated space</em>, which may include true calibrated CMYK (not
the approximation of the <span class="ui">CMYK</span> tab) or Adobe RGB. This
requires you to set up the color management in <span class="ui">Input/Output<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Color management</span> in<span class="ui">Preferences</span> (<a href="c18.xhtml#section18.8">18.8</a>).</p>
			<a id="section8.4.3"/><h3>8.4.3 HSL and HSV</h3>
			<p>
				Neither RGB nor CMYK are very intuitive; they represent the way computers and
printers deal with color, not the way artists use it. Inkscape 
offers a more natural color model: <em>HSL (Hue, Saturation,
Lightness)</em>. Unlike RGB and CMYK, the channels of HSL are not individual colors
mixed together; rather, they are the <em>properties</em> of the color that, together,
define it unambiguously.</p>
			<p>
				The <em>hue</em> channel is the rainbow of maximum-saturation colors, starting from red
and going through yellow, green, blue, purple, and back to red. The <em>saturation</em>
channel positions a color somewhere from maximum
colorfulness, through drab and dull, to pure gray—at the same brightness level.
Finally, the <em>lightness</em> channel goes from black to the
given color and then to white; this means any color with maximum lightness is white and
any color with zero lightness is black, regardless of hue and saturation.</p>
			<p>The HSL color model, once you get used to it, is very intuitive. When you feel that
some color isn't quite right, you may think it needs to be made lighter or less saturated—not that it needs more red or green.
Many color-related tools in Inkscape prefer HSL for choosing and changing colors.</p>
			<p>
				In the <span class="ui">Fill and Stroke</span> dialog, there are two tabs that allow you to
edit a color in the HSL model (see <a id="figref4"/><a href="c15b.xhtml#ill-fig4">Figure 4 in the color insert</a>).
The first one (<span class="ui">HSL</span>) uses traditional linear
sliders. The other one (<span class="ui">Wheel</span>) has a circular ring for the H channel
(which therefore has a better resolution: if straightened, it would be
longer than a linear slider fitting into the window) and a triangle that encodes
the saturation and lightness channels. Rotating the mark on the hue ring rotates the
triangle too, so that its maximum-saturation tip always points to the current hue on the
ring.</p>
			<p>
				Inkscape also supports a similar color model called <em>HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value)</em>.
Other programs may call it HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness). The only difference from HSL is
that with HSV, the Value component changes only from black to a given color (such as red). To
get pure white in HSV, you need to set Value to maximum <em>and</em> Saturation
to zero. In HSL, the Lightness component ranges all the way from black
through a given color to white, so it is symmetric with regard to light and dark.</p>
			<a id="section8.5"/><h2>8.5 The Palette</h2>
			<p>
				The simplest way to assign a color to the fill or stroke of selected objects is
by clicking one of the swatches in the <em>palette</em>, usually located at the bottom of
the editing window above the status bar (see <a id="figref5"/><a href="c15b.xhtml#ill-fig5">Figure 5 in the color insert</a>). Simply<a id="148"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_148" title="148"/>clicking assigns fill color to the selected objects; Shift-clicking assigns
stroke color. The leftmost button on the palette <em>removes</em> fill or (with
Shift) stroke.</p>
			<p>Apart from clicking, you can drag and drop colors from the palette onto
objects. This is one of the few ways to change objects without selecting them: when
you drop a color on an object, only that object will change, even if it is not selected and
even if some other object is selected. Dropping also works for changing stroke
color: just drop the color swatch precisely onto the outline of a path or shape.</p>
			<p>Inkscape comes with many stock palettes.
On the right end of the palette, there's a button with a
triangle mark; click it to open a menu listing available palettes—such as 
a web-safe palette, palettes used by Ubuntu and Windows for their UI, and various
monochromatic palettes (greens, golds, and so on).</p>
			<p>
				In the same menu, you can choose one of the standard <em>sizes</em> of swatches, their<em>width</em> (narrow swatches are harder to click but may get rid of the palette's
scroll bar by fitting the entire palette to your screen width), as well as enable the
palette to <em>wrap around</em> (which makes it taller but also gets rid of the scroll bar).
Also, if you prefer, you can turn on the border around the palette's swatches.</p>
			<p>
				In addition to the always-docked horizontal palette, Inkscape has the <span class="ui">Swatches</span> dialog
(Shift-Ctrl-W), shown in <a href="#fig8-6">Figure 8-6</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig8-6"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="09/swatches.svg.png"/>

			</figure>
			<p><a id="149"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_149" title="149"/>It has all the same palettes and size
options, except that it has an additional <span class="ui">List</span> option where it lists all the
colors along with their names. Being a dialog, it can float wherever you need it
or be placed in the dock on the right and squeezed into a narrow vertical
strip.</p>
			<a id="section8.5.1"/><h3>8.5.1 Editing Palettes</h3>
			<p>
				Each Inkscape palette is a text file in a simple format that you can edit. 
If you have created a new palette and want Inkscape to use it, go to<span class="ui"><strong>Preferences</strong></span>, <span class="ui"><strong>System</strong></span> page, and click <span class="ui"><strong>Open</strong></span> next to <span class="ui"><strong>User palettes</strong></span>.
This will open a folder where you can place your palette file; on the next launch,
Inkscape will add it to its list of palettes.</p>
			<p>Inkscape's palette format is that of the GIMP raster editor, so you can drop any palettes from a GIMP distribution into
that folder to use them in Inkscape.  Here's the beginning of the default palette
file, inkscape.gpl; the color components (R, G, B) are in the 0–255 format:</p>
			<pre>GIMP Palette
Name: Inkscape default
Columns: 3
# generated by PaletteGen.py 0   0   0  Black 26  26  26  90% Gray 51  51  51  80% Gray 77  77  77  70% Gray
...</pre>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Auto</span> option in the list of predefined palettes lets you create a custom palette saved with the current document. To add, or edit, a color in the Auto palette, you need to create a swatch in the <span class="ui">Fill and Stroke</span> dialog (<a href="#section8.2">8.2</a>).</p>
				<a id="section8.6"/>
				<h2>8.6 The Selected Style Indicator: Paint Commands</h2>
			<p>
				Apart from the various paint styles, the right-click menu of
the selected style indicator (<a href="#fig8-2">Figure 8-2</a>) has several useful commands for dealing
with paint. Note that the fill swatch (top) and stroke swatch (bottom) are distinct even though their context menus are similar; be sure to right-click the
half that you want to change.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><span class="ui">Edit fill</span>/<span class="ui">stroke...</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Choosing this, as well as simply clicking the
fill or stroke swatch, opens the <span class="ui">Fill and Stroke</span> dialog.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><span class="ui">Last set color</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						This assigns to the selection the color that was last <em>set</em> on
the corresponding paint (that is, on fill or stroke) of any selected object. For example, if
you just painted something a particular shade of blue and now want<em>all</em> your objects to have that fill, select all and call this command from the
fill swatch's right-click menu.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><span class="ui"><a id="150"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_150" title="150"/>Last selected color</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						This assigns to the selected object the corresponding
paint (that is, fill or stroke) of the object that was <em>selected</em> before the most recent selection
change. For example, select an object whose fill color you like, then select some other
object, and use this command on its fill swatch to assign the same color to it.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><span class="ui">Invert</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This replaces a flat-color paint by the (RGB) inversion of its
color—for example, white becomes black and yellow becomes blue.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><span class="ui">White</span> <span class="rm">and</span> <span class="ui">Black</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>These commands simply assign those colors to the paint.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><span class="ui">Copy color</span> <span class="rm">and</span> <span class="ui">Paste color</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						These commands allow you to exchange objects'
colors via the system clipboard. For example, you can copy one object's stroke color and
assign it to another object's fill, or paste a color (as an <code>#RRGGBB</code>
string) into any other program where you might need it.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><span class="ui">Swap fill and stroke</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						This command exchanges the fill and stroke paints on selected
objects. For example, if a selected object had no stroke and a blue fill, after applying this
command, it will have a blue stroke and no fill. This command can be useful when you use
both the Pencil (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.1.2">14.1.2</a>) and the Calligraphic pen (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.2">14.2</a>) tools for drawing and want the result to
use the same color, even though the Pencil creates stroked paths without fill and the
Calligraphic pen creates filled paths without stroke.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><span class="ui">Unset fill</span>/<span class="ui">stroke</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Make fill or stroke <em>unset</em> (<a href="#section8.2">8.2</a>). 
This is not the same as removing it.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><span class="ui">Remove fill</span>/<span class="ui">stroke</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Set fill or stroke to <code>none</code> (<a href="#section8.2">8.2</a>). This
command has a shortcut: middle-click the fill or stroke swatch
to set the corresponding paint to <code>none</code>; if the paint is already removed,
middle-clicking creates the default fill or stroke (usually black). Thus, to get rid of stroke on
selected objects, Shift-click
the "no paint" swatch on the palette or middle-click the bottom of the selected style indicator.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><span class="ui">Make fill</span>/<span class="ui">stroke opaque</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Remove any fill opacity or stroke opacity
from paint (<a href="#section8.3">8.3</a>). Master opacity (shown by the <span class="ui">O</span>
control to the right of the swatches) remains unchanged.</p>
				</dd>
			</dl><a id="section8.7"/>
			<h2>8.7 The Selected Style Indicator: Color Gestures</h2>
			<p>
				Apart from its other numerous functions, the selected style indicator has a convenient and somewhat unique
method for quick adjustment of colors: <em>color gestures</em>.
Simply grab the fill or stroke color swatch and drag it out onto the canvas, with or without
modifier keys, as described below.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p><a id="151"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_151" title="151"/>Color gestures work only when the swatch displays a <em>flat color</em>;
they do not work when a swatch displays <span class="ui">None</span> (no paint), <span class="ui">N/A</span> (nothing is selected), or a
gradient (although you can select one or more gradient stops in the Gradient tool and
color-adjust them by color gestures just as you would with objects).</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>
				Color gestures work in the HSL color space (<a href="#section8.4.3">8.4.3</a>). Dragging without any keyboard
modifiers adjusts the hue channel, dragging with Shift adjusts
saturation, and dragging with Ctrl adjusts lightness.</p>
			<p>
				Think of it as "rotating" the color swatch: by dragging from it, you pull out an invisible handle and
use it to rotate it away from the original direction, which is assumed to be 45 degrees to the northeast. 
When you click and drag the color swatch,
imagine a line—a <em>no-change axis</em>—going from the point where you clicked, diagonally, into the drawing area of the window.
By dragging <em>below</em> or <em>to the right</em> of that axis, you<em>decrease</em> the corresponding color channel, down to the minimum at the lower edge of the
window; by dragging it <em>above</em> or <em>to the left</em>, you <em>increase</em> it, up
to the maximum at the left
edge of the window.  If you hover your mouse exactly over the no-change axis, there is 
no change (see <a id="figref6"/><a href="c15b.xhtml#ill-fig6">Figure 6 in the color insert</a>). The status bar reports, as you drag, the channel you
are adjusting, the original value of that channel, the new value, and the difference.</p>
			<p>The angular nature of the color gestures means that it's easy to adjust the
precision. When you drag close enough to the swatch, any small
movement produces a big change of color. If you need a finer adjustment, just drag
farther away from the swatch, toward the center of the Inkscape window or even to its
upper-right corner, where the same movements will make much smaller changes in 
color.</p>
			<p>You can switch channels while you drag—that is, you don't need to drag from
the swatch again and again if you want to adjust all three channels. You can do it all
in one drag by pressing and releasing Ctrl and Shift as
necessary. The moment you change the keyboard modifiers while dragging, the zero-change
axis for the new channel is temporarily moved up to go through the current mouse position;
this way there are no sudden changes in color if you happen to switch modifiers away from the
original 45-degree line.</p>
			<p>
				The Alt modifier is special: pressing Alt while dragging means "do nothing."
This allows you to move the mouse, without releasing, to a more convenient place from
which you can continue tweaking the color after letting go of Alt. As with the
other modifiers, releasing Alt temporarily redefines the no-change axis to
go through the point where Alt was released. For example, imagine you made
your color darker by Ctrl-dragging toward the bottom edge of the window.
If you then need to make it less saturated but can't Shift-drag it any lower because there's
no room, without releasing the mouse, simply Alt-drag it upward to a convenient spot and then
Shift-drag downward as needed. You can also <em>start</em> dragging from the swatch
with Alt to avoid any change of color until you reach a more convenient
position for adjusting it.</p>
			<p>
				For example, select a green rectangle and first turn it greenish-blue by
dragging away from the fill swatch and slightly above the 45-degree line.
Then, without releasing the mouse, press Ctrl and drag a bit to the right to
darken the color; next, press Shift, release Ctrl, and adjust
saturation. You can press and <a id="152"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_152" title="152"/>release Ctrl and Shift as many times
as necessary during a drag; when you are finally satisfied with your color,
release the mouse to commit the change.</p>
			<p>In addition to fine adjustments, here are some quick color gestures for common color changes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ctrl-drag the swatch to the right and down to paint all selected objects black.</li>
				<li>Ctrl-drag the swatch up and to the left to paint all selected objects white.</li>
				<li>Shift-drag the swatch to the right and down to desaturate the selected objects' color 
(turn them to gray).</li>
				<li>Shift-drag the swatch up and to the left to maximize
saturation of the selected objects' color.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				When several objects or gradient stops with different colors are
selected, the selected style indicator shows their <em>averaged</em> color. If you adjust
that color by gesturing, the changed color will be assigned back to all selected objects
or stops, in effect eliminating any difference between them. This makes the feature less
useful than it could be; if you want to adjust many
different-colored objects preserving their relative differences, use the color modes of
the Tweak tool (<a href="#section8.9">8.9</a>), color adjustment extensions (<a href="#section8.10.1">8.10.1</a>), or color filters (<a href="#section8.10.2">8.10.2</a>).</p>
			<a id="section8.8"/><h2>8.8 The Dropper Tool</h2>
			<p>
				The Dropper tool allows you to pick a color (and, optionally, opacity) directly
from any point or area of 
the drawing and assign it to the selected objects (or to selected gradient handles,<a href="c10.xhtml#section10.4.2">10.4.2</a>). With this tool, you can use your own drawing as a palette, easily reusing colors you
have already created for something else. It is also indispensable when you need to combine and blend
vector objects with an imported bitmap.</p>
			<p>
				The important thing about this tool is that when picking colors, it pays no
attention to what <em>object</em> you click; instead, it simply takes the color of the
clicked <em>pixel</em> in the rendered screen image. This means you can easily pick colors
from bitmaps, stacks of semitransparent objects, blur fringes (<a href="c17.xhtml#section17.1">17.1</a>), or the
middle of a gradient. The tool sees exactly what you see; if an object is too small to be rendered at
the current zoom, you can't pick out its color with the Dropper tool either. Also, if you click the edge of
a black object on a white background, you may get a midrange gray color of
the anti-aliasing pixel in that point (see <a href="c01.xhtml#fig1-1">Figure 1-1</a>).</p>
			<a id="section8.8.1"/><h3>8.8.1 Sampling</h3>
			<p>
				When you switch to the Dropper tool (F7 or D), the
status bar starts to report the color located directly under the cursor. So, if you want to know
the color of some area, you don't even need to click—just hover your mouse over that
area and read the status bar. Also, at any time you can press Ctrl-C to
copy the color under the cursor to the clipboard (in the form of an<code>RRGGBBAA</code> hex string); from there you can paste it, for example, into
the <span class="ui">Fill and Stroke</span> dialog's <span class="ui">RGBA</span> field or to any external program.</p>
			<a id="section8.8.2"/><h3>
				8.8.2 <a id="153"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_153" title="153"/>Assigning</h3>
			<p>
				You can assign colors to selected objects (or gradient handles) either by
clicking or by dragging. With a click, you just take the color of the
screen pixel that happens to be under your mouse cursor. With a drag, you create a
circular area centered at the point where you started dragging, and when you
release the mouse, the tool <em>averages</em> the colors of all pixels inside this circle, as shown in <a href="#fig8-7">Figure 8-7</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig8-7"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="09/dropper.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 8-7: Using the Dropper tool</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Picking with averaging is especially useful for sampling colors from
bitmaps. For example, if you need to create a vector object that would blend with the
cheek of a face on a photo, picking single pixels from the cheek is unlikely to work:
the picked colors will be too light or too dark due to 
the nonuniformities of the photo's texture. If, however, you average
the colors from a circular area covering a good part of the cheek, the result will be much more
realistic.</p>
			<p>By default, the Dropper assigns its colors to the fill of the selected
objects. When you Shift-click or Shift-drag, it will instead
change their stroke.</p>
			<a id="section8.8.3"/><h3>8.8.3 Opacity</h3>
			<p>
				Using the two toggle buttons on the controls bar of the Dropper tool, you can change
the way it treats transparency (<a href="#fig8-8">Figure 8-8</a>). The <span class="ui">Opacity: Pick</span> button controls whether the
opacity under the cursor is picked, and the <span class="ui">Assign</span> button
controls whether that picked opacity value is assigned to selected objects. (When<span class="ui">Pick</span> is off, the <span class="ui">Assign</span> button is disabled.)</p>
			<a id="fig8-8"/><figure>

					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>
						The opacity that the tool picks is the <em>accumulated</em> opacity of all
objects at the click point. For example, if you click a single object with 50 percent
opacity, the picked value is 50 percent. If two such objects overlay, the picked value is
75 percent. Empty canvas is always considered fully transparent; the Dropper tool ignores the opacity of the page
background (as set in <span class="ui">Document Properties</span>, <a href="c03.xhtml#section3.5.3">3.5.3</a>).</p>

					<p>
						If <span class="ui">Assign</span> is off, the bright red color
(<code>FF0000</code>) is assigned to the selected objects' fill or stroke, whereas the

			<h2>8.9 Color Tweaking</h2>
			<p>
				You've already seen some of the capabilities of the Tweak tool in the chapter on
transformations (<a href="c06.xhtml#section6.10">6.10</a>). Let's look at its two modes for changing
colors of objects, <em>Color Paint</em> and <em>Color Jitter</em>. Both of these modes work on flat color
paint as well as on gradients (<a href="c10.xhtml#section10.6">10.6</a>). Refer to <a href="c06.xhtml#section6.10">6.10</a> to review how the tool's <span class="ui">Width</span> and <span class="ui">Force</span> parameters work.</p>
			<a id="section8.9.1"/><h3>8.9.1 Color Paint</h3>
			<p>
				The Color Paint mode is used to apply color to the selected objects <em>under the
brush</em>, as shown in <a href="#fig8-9">Figure 8-9</a>. The color being used—more precisely, the <em>style</em> because it includes both
fill and stroke—can be seen in the style swatch at the right end of the tool's
controls bar (above the canvas). To change this applied style, simply click the color palette (or use any
other style-editing command, such as the <span class="ui">Fill and Stroke</span> dialog) while you are in 
this mode of the Tweak tool.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>Unlike all other tools, in the Tweak tool in Color Paint mode, you cannot assign style
directly to selected objects. Any style-setting commands are "intercepted" to change
the tool's style instead.</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>
				The fill from the tool's style applies to the fills of the painted objects,
and the stroke applies to the strokes. If the tool's style has no fill or no
stroke, it won't affect fills or strokes, correspondingly. For example, if you want to
color the fills of objects blue but leave their strokes untouched, assign blue fill to
the tool's <a id="155"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_155" title="155"/>style (just click blue on the palette) but set its stroke to <code>none</code>
(middle-click the <span class="ui"><strong>Stroke</strong></span> swatch in the status bar).</p>
			<a id="fig8-9"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="09/tweak-paint.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 8-9: Using the Color Paint mode of the Tweak
tool</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				This mode literally paints on objects, <em>gradually</em> shifting their colors
toward the target color. For example, if you keep painting with yellow fill over a blue-filled
object, the object will first become greenish blue, then green, then yellowish green;
eventually it will be the exact yellow color you're painting with.</p>
			<p>
				Painting with Shift pressed <em>inverts</em> the color you're applying
(for example, when painting with yellow, Shift will gradually apply blue).</p>
			<p>
				The speed of this gradual transition depends on both the <span class="ui">Force</span> value and, 
if you have a pressure-sensitive tablet, the
pen pressure. Also, since the brush is "soft," objects touched by the periphery of 
the brush are less affected than
those hit by the brush center.</p>
			<a id="section8.9.2"/><h3>8.9.2 Color Jitter</h3>
			<p>
				The Color Jitter mode, instead of applying a specific color, <em>jitters</em>—randomizes—the colors of the objects it touches.
The force of the action determines the amount of randomization—that is, how far the colors deviate from their original
values, as shown in <a href="#fig8-10">Figure 8-10</a>.</p>

			<h3>
				8.9.3 <a id="156"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_156" title="156"/>Channels</h3>
			<p>
				On the Tweak tool's controls bar, to the right of the <span class="ui">Mode</span> buttons, there are four<span class="ui">Channels</span> toggles: <span class="ui">H</span>, <span class="ui">S</span>, <span class="ui">L</span>, and <span class="ui">O</span>. 
This is where you turn on and off the tool's action on the object's hue, saturation, lightness, and
opacity, correspondingly.</p>
			<p>
				For example, if you want to raise the saturation of some part of your drawing without
changing any hues, select some maximum-saturation color (such as pure red) and turn off all<span class="ui">Channels</span> buttons except <span class="ui">S</span>. Or you can replace the hues without
affecting saturation or lightness (with only <span class="ui">H</span> turned on), or lighten/darken all
colors without changing their hues and saturations (only <span class="ui">L</span> turned on). Enabling<span class="ui">O</span> applies the master opacity from the tool's style to the master opacity of
objects (but not fill or stroke opacity).</p>
			<a id="section8.9.4"/><h3>8.9.4 Usage Notes</h3>
			<p>Color painting is similar to a soft brush in a raster editor (such as GIMP or
Photoshop). Even though the tool works as a brush, it still applies its
color to vector objects, which behave as vector objects usually do. For example, if you
want to change the tint of a face in your drawing, and if a hand in the drawing is
part of the same path object as the face, that hand's tint will change too, even if it's
located far from the point you are painting. Still, even with this limitation, color
painting allows you to quickly and intuitively make adjustments that would be
awkward with traditional vector tools.</p>
			<p>Drawings with scatterings of small independent objects are especially suitable
for color painting with the Tweak tool. Examples include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Freehand drawings with the Calligraphic pen (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.2">14.2</a>), consisting of many separate strokes.</li>
				<li>
					Object sprayings made with the Spray tool (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.7">4.7</a>).</li>
				<li>
					Patterns made with the clone tiler (<a href="c16.xhtml#section16.6">16.6</a>). You will need to unset
the fill and/or stroke on the original object and use the <span class="ui">Color</span> tab of the<span class="ui">Create Tiled Clones</span> dialog to assign some initial color to the clones—this will make
them paintable with the Tweak tool without unlinking.</li>
				<li>
					Imported vector art with many small tiles, such as 3D-to-vector conversions
where a smooth shape is approximated with polygons or gradient meshes imported from Adobe Illustrator's
AI files (<a href="b02.xhtml#sectionB.5">B.5</a>), which Inkscape renders as lattices of small polygons. Although Inkscape now
has its own Mesh tool (<a href="c10.xhtml#section10.7">10.7</a>), it cannot import AI meshes as meshes—but color painting
on the imported tiles may sometimes be almost as good as editing the mesh.</li>
				<li>
					Text converted to paths, where each letter
is a separate path (<a href="c15.xhtml#section15.5">15.5</a>).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Color tweaking can also be useful for compositions with just a few objects or even for
single objects. Unlike all other color selection methods, painting with the Tweak tool
implements the <em>color mixing</em> metaphor, which may be more natural for an
artist than RGB sliders or even the HSL color wheel.</p>
			<p>
				For example, start with a rectangle
of pure blue color. Switch to the Color Paint mode, 
pick a number of different colors from the palette, and apply light touches
with minimum force and minimum pen pressure. Add a little green, a <a id="157"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_157" title="157"/>little brown, a
little yellow, and so on—until you have the exact mixed tint you need. Similarly, you can whiten or
blacken any object by adding white or black.</p>
			<p>
				You can also use color tweaking to darken, lighten, saturate, desaturate, add a tint, 
or color-jitter your entire drawing. Just select all in all layers (Ctrl-Alt-A),
zoom out, expand your brush so it covers all of the
drawing, and apply a little color tweaking (with minimum <span class="ui">Force</span>) that will
thus affect all visible objects.</p>

			<p>
				You've already seen a number of Inkscape's style setting commands and tools,
each with its own approaches and capabilities. Naturally, each of them has downsides, too.
In particular, the <span class="ui">Fill and Stroke</span> dialog and the selected style indicator cannot
edit many different colors without unifying them.
On the other hand, although the Tweak tool can adjust multiple colors independently, it actually
requires you to paint on the canvas, so it can be slow and imprecise.</p>
			<a id="section8.10.1"/><h3>8.10.1 Color Extensions</h3>
			<p>
				A group of extensions in the <span class="ui">Color</span> submenu of the<span class="ui">Extensions</span> menu allows you to adjust all colors in the selection at once. These
commands affect both fill and stroke colors, including colors of gradient stops, but excluding
bitmaps or
patterns. They include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					A full set of <em>HSL adjustments</em> (increasing and decreasing hue, saturation, or
lightness by 5 percent).</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Brighter</span> and <span class="ui">Darker</span> (adjust brightness up or down by 10 percent).</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Desaturate</span> (set HSL saturation to zero).</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Grayscale</span> (equalize the three RGB channels; the result is largely similar
but different from that of <span class="ui">Desaturate</span>).</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Black and white</span> with adjustable threshold; colors brighter than the threshold become white, others become black.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Negative</span> (for example, convert black to white, yellow to blue, and so on).</li>
				<li>
					Commands for removing or swapping the <span class="ui">Red</span>, <span class="ui">Green</span>, and <span class="ui">Blue</span> channels.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Replace color</span> to replace any color you specify with another.</li>
				<li>
					A <span class="ui">Custom</span> command where you can provide your own formulas for modifying the
color channels, using the values of other channels if necessary.</li>
			</ul><a id="section8.10.2"/>
			<h3>8.10.2 Color Filters</h3>
			<p>
				A better way to manipulate colors of objects is by using SVG filter effects (<a href="c17.xhtml#ch17">Chapter 17</a>),
specifically the preset filters from the <span class="ui">Filters<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Color</span> submenu.
Compared to extensions, SVG filters are nondestructive (the original colors of objects are
preserved and can be restored simply by removing the effect) and work on everything, including 
bitmaps and patterns. Filters in Inkscape can also be interactive: many of them have adjustable
parameters, and if you enable the <a id="158"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_158" title="158"/><span class="ui">Live Preview</span> checkbox in the filter's dialog, you will be able
to experiment with the parameters watching the result live on canvas before you commit.</p>
			<p>
				In past versions of Inkscape, filters were much slower to render—but this is no longer the case,
especially for the relatively simple color filters. You can create your own color filters
(using the <span class="ui">Color Matrix</span> primitive, <a href="c17.xhtml#ch17">Chapter 17</a>), but doing so is not for the faint of heart; fortunately,
Inkscape has many ready-to-use preset filters to cover most needs—perhaps even too many 
for this book to cover every one. Still, here are the most universally useful filters from<span class="ui">Filters<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Color</span>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="ui">Color Shift</span> rotates all the hues by a given amount; you can also increase or decrease saturation.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Colorize</span> shows your drawing as it would look through colored glass; you can select the color with a color chooser in the dialog.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Duochrome</span> re-paints your drawing in two tones—for example, with blue shades and yellow lights; you can select both colors.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Extract Channel</span> lets you suppress all color channels except one (R, G, B, or C, M, Y); the extracted channel can be converted to alpha.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Fade to Black or White</span> lets you naturally blend, by an adjustable amount, your drawing with a black or white background.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Grayscale</span> converts to grayscale; unlike the extension, you can interactively adjust how much each channel (out of R, G, B, and L) participates in the result.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Lightness-Contrast</span> works pretty much as you would expect.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Invert</span> lets you selectively invert some of the channels.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Soft Colors</span> creates a soft glow around the color boundaries; this filter is not interactive, but you can adjust the color of the glow (yellowish green by default) in the Filter Editor (<a href="c17.xhtml#section17.5">17.5</a>).</li>

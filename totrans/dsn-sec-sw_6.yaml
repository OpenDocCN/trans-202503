- en: Terminology that is specific to software security may seem straightforward,
    but nuances are important to get right. I have evolved the following security-specific
    meanings of terms based on my experience across multiple companies and many diverse
    projects, and while these definitions are generally accepted, don’t be surprised
    if you find diversity in the terminology used in the wild. If you pay close attention,
    you’ll notice that security specialists define and use the same terms in slightly
    different ways, bringing their own unique perspectives to the foundational precepts
    of the field. Expect to hear many variations, because there is no accepted standard
    vocabulary; usually, however, these variations are easy to deduce in context.

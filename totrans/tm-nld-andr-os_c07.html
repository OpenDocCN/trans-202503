<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">T</span>he systems team is responsible for the lowest layers of the software stack. You can think of their work as connecting the phone hardware (the Sooner, Dream/G1, Droid, and every other device that the team worked on) to the rest of the software running on each device.</p>
<p>At the bottom layer of everything running on Android (or any operating system) is the kernel. The kernel is a combination of the interface between the actual hardware and the rest of the system, plus everything that an OS has to do to make everything run (like boot up the system, create processes,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-1" id="c07-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup> manage memory, and handle communication between processes). If a phone were a house, the kernel would be the foundation, the wiring, and the plumbing running through the walls, making that “drip, drip, drip” sound keeping you from getting back to sleep in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Hardware communication is handled by <em>device </em><em>drivers</em> in the kernel, which are software modules that talk to the actual hardware on a device. For example, in order to display pixels on the screen, a driver translates between the information from the graphics software (which figures out what color each pixel in the display should be to show, say, images, text, and buttons) and the physical screen hardware where those pixels live. Similarly, when <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_46" title="46"/>the user touches the screen, that action is turned into raw hardware signals indicating the affected locations. These signals are sent into the system as <em>touch events</em>, which are then processed by software, including applications that want to handle those events.</p>
<p>One of the fundamental tasks of the systems group is <em>bringup</em>, which is the process of getting from simply having a piece of hardware (a phone, or even a prototype of a phone, with a collection of chips, circuitry, and a display) to one that boots the Android operating system.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c07-0001">Brian Swetland and the Kernel</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">With Swetland’s background in low-level systems, and the fact that he was the first person to join, it was only natural that he headed up the Android systems team from day one. Brian was already working and leading the systems efforts pre-acquisition; he continued in that role after moving over to Google and as the team grew.</p>
<p>The main work of the systems team was to get the kernel working, for the early Android devices and for every new Android device since.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-2" id="c07-footnoteref-2">2</a></sup> When Android was a startup, the kernel needed to be just good enough that the demo could run. But after the team started at Google, they had to shift toward building a real product: a full OS and platform on top of a solid kernel. </p>
<p>Fortunately, Swetland ensured that the early prototype kernel provided a decent starting point: “Everything I was building was toward something that would eventually be a product. I’m not a believer in doing total one-off demos. We didn’t have process separation,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-3" id="c07-footnoteref-3">3</a></sup> but we knew where that was going to go. We still needed the kernel, the bootloader,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-4" id="c07-footnoteref-4">4</a></sup> the graphics drivers, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_47" title="47"/>everything. We did some demo-y things along the way, but we always tried to chart a path where it wasn’t pure demo. It was progress towards a system.”</p>
<p>Swetland’s feelings toward demo-ware came from experience in previous companies where people on the business side misunderstood the difference between a great demo and an actual product. “The dangerous thing of building purely demo-ware is someone decides you’re going to ship it. Then you’re screwed.”</p>
<p>So Swetland worked on the kernel that Android would build on top of: “We kept working with it [the kernel from the demo]. It’s basically Linux off-the-shelf and then driver work on top of it. There are some patches in mainline Linux<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-5" id="c07-footnoteref-5">5</a></sup> from F-Sample<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-6" id="c07-footnoteref-6">6</a></sup> with my name on them that I submitted after I went to Google. We weren’t thinking a lot about upstreaming<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-7" id="c07-footnoteref-7">7</a></sup> stuff in the early days.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Swetland and his team started to see some tangible advantages to being part of Google. Prior to Google, “It was a little painful, as a tiny company making progress with TI [Texas Instruments]. The level of support was not what we got later.” Then after starting at Google, “It became massively easier to get support from the vendors. Surprise, surprise. People stopped talking about how much we would have to pay to get development boards. They’d bring us hardware, which is kinda nice. That’s one of the big advantages of Google, being this recognized name instead of this unknown tiny startup. People will pick up the phone and answer your questions. We still had to fight for support in places, but it could have been a lot worse.”</p>
<p>One of the legends of Brian Swetland was how he “found” extra memory on the G1 shortly before it shipped. He submitted a fix in the run-up to the release, expanding the available RAM on the device from 160MB to 192MB, giving the OS and all applications 20 percent more memory to play with, which was a significant boost on this very memory-constrained system.</p>
<p>The trick was that he knew where to find that memory because he had hidden it in the first place. The kernel is responsible for making memory available for the rest of the system to use. When he first brought up the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_48" title="48"/>kernel on the G1, he configured it to report less memory that it actually had. To the rest of the system, there was effectively 32MB less memory for use than was physically available in the hardware. He did this with the certain knowledge that every developer would use all available memory if it was there, but they’d work within a tighter budget if they had to.</p>
<p>Everyone got their software working in this much smaller pool of memory, because that’s all they had. When he freed the rest of the memory before the G1 shipped, that meant more was available for running more applications simultaneously, because he had forced the entire system into an artificially smaller space than necessary.</p>
<p>Nick Pelly, who joined the team later to work on Bluetooth, remembered that not everyone was happy how this worked out: “OMG the drama this caused. The Browser team had been pulling extra Sundays to fit into the (false) memory budget. I remember one of them storming into Brian’s office with some loud and choice words when he ‘found’ that extra memory.”</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c07-0002">Ficus Kirkpatrick and Drivers</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The kernel itself didn’t need extra hands working on it. This might be surprising, given the complexity of the kernel and its importance in the overall system. But Linux was there already, and where it wasn’t sufficient, Swetland was on it. But kernel <em>drivers</em>, on the other hand, were in serious demand. The system required all kinds of different hardware which had to be handled by the kernel. So when Ficus Kirkpatrick joined Swetland’s team, he got busy writing drivers, starting with the camera.</p>
<p>“I was into OSes and low level stuff, which is the core thing that I was best at coming into Android. The first year or two [on Android] it was low level systems stuff. We had decided to use Linux, so there wasn’t a lot of kernel work. So I was doing a lot of driver stuff. I did the first camera driver, got that working on OMAP.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-8" id="c07-footnoteref-8">8</a></sup> Also got audio working.” Once audio was possible, “We can pass buffers, or we can get camera data in, what are we going to do with it?” So Ficus moved onto the media framework, creating APIs<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-9" id="c07-footnoteref-9">9</a></sup> and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_49" title="49"/>functionality for applications to be able to access the new audio and camera capabilities of the device.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c07-0003">Arve Hjønnevåg and Communication</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">One of the missing drivers early on was for the radio<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-10" id="c07-footnoteref-10">10</a></sup> hardware; there was no way for the new phone OS to make a phone call. So Swetland brought in someone who excelled at communications drivers.</p>
<p>Arve Hjønnevåg joined Swetland’s systems team in March of 2006. He was well known on Android for his . . . silence. His teammate Rebecca (who enters the story in a few pages) said she would sometimes ask him for help on a system they used for managing their source code. She got used to responding to his answers with, “Again, with more words.”</p>
<p>Once Arve got the system talking to the radio hardware, he focused on power management. Specifically, now that the hardware was able to make and receive phone calls, it also needed to not fall asleep when the system was in the middle of a call.</p>
<p>At the time, Linux was great for servers and desktop systems, including laptops. But it wasn’t built for phones, and it needed new functionality to handle this new use case. When you close a laptop lid, you want the laptop to go to sleep, completely. You don’t want or need anything running on the system until you open the lid later.</p>
<p>But a phone is quite different. When the screen turns off, you don’t want it doing everything that it might be doing when you’re actively using it, but you do want it awake enough to, say, continue a phone call<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-11" id="c07-footnoteref-11">11</a></sup> that you are in the middle of, or to keep playing music that you are listening to.</p>
<p>So Arve added the concept of <em>wake locks</em> to Android’s Linux kernel, to ensure that screen-off didn’t mean completely-off. Android would aggressively put applications and most of the system to sleep when the screen turned off (because battery consumption was always a huge concern), but wake locks ensured that the system could stay in a wakeful state if there was something happening that needed to continue even if the screen turned off.</p>

</figure>
<p>Arve submitted the wake lock feature into Android’s version of Linux. This feature caused a bit of a stir in the Linux community, as some stalwarts of that open source community saw this feature as an example of Android forking<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-12" id="c07-footnoteref-12">12</a></sup> the Linux kernel. Chris DiBona (who dealt<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-13" id="c07-footnoteref-13">13</a></sup> a lot with open source projects) remembers talking to people from the community at a Linux conference around that time. “There was one guy who was spitting mad, ‘I can’t believe you’re doing this!’</p>
<p>“I was like, ‘Three years from now, this won’t be a problem. In between now and then, either the Linux community will accept our patches in the shape they’re in right now, they’ll modify them slightly, maybe they call them something different, or you’ll leave behind every mobile device in the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_51" title="51"/>market. So work with us to make something that’s acceptable. Otherwise we’re going to keep shipping because it’s very important to us that this has a decent battery life.’”</p>
<p>In the end, Linux didn’t take Android’s wake lock implementation directly, but they did implement something that solves the same problem.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c07-0004">Iliyan Malchev and Bluetooth</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Display drivers were another problem that the systems team had to solve. It doesn’t help having a powerful operating system if you can’t see what it’s doing. Iliyan Malchev got to work on this problem when he joined the team.</p>
<p>Iliyan learned to program when he was eight years old in Bulgaria, using a language he did not speak. His parents got a computer for their home and Iliyan started playing around with it. “It was amazing; I’m banging on the keyboard and things are happening on the screen—that’s what really got me interested in it. I didn’t know what I was doing. It’s not like I immediately became a programmer. In Bulgaria, everything was Cyrillic alphabet. Everything [in program code] was in the Latin script, like program listings. I didn’t speak English or know the Latin alphabet, so I’d just copy it, letter by letter.”</p>
<p>Iliyan made his way to the US for college and ended up working at Qualcomm for a few years. This experience was incredibly helpful to his later work on Android, and for the systems team in particular, since Android devices use a lot of Qualcomm hardware.</p>
<p>Iliyan joined Swetland’s systems team in May of 2006. His first project was getting a secondary display to work: “[Swetland] tosses me a flip phone with 2 displays. He said, ‘make the peripheral display work.’ Being Swetland, he booted Linux on this without any docs. I guess he just wanted to give me something to get me off his back.”</p>
<p>After that project, Sooner devices<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-14" id="c07-footnoteref-14">14</a></sup> started arriving on the team. Iliyan worked on getting hardware input working on the device: a D-Pad (up/down/left/right arrows) and a trackball. In the meantime, he noticed that Android was getting too big to fit in the device’s limited storage space, and the system was constantly growing, so he spent time optimizing the size of the system to make things fit.</p>

</figure>
<p>He then worked on Bluetooth. This included making the driver work for the Bluetooth hardware, as well as the Bluetooth software that applications could use to talk to the device. “This was the first Bluetooth software on Android and it was . . . not very good. [Bluetooth] is a terrible standard. They invented something of the scope and complexity of the internet to essentially support wireless headphones. It’s so over-engineered. I did that, then I handed it over to another engineer, Nick Pelly. Nick took the Bluetooth stack and made it work. He deserves all the credit.”</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c07-0005">Nick Pelly and Bluetooth</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Nick studied computer science at university in Australia but didn’t think he’d end up programming for a living. He lined up a job at Telstra in communications engineering that was going to start after returning from a post-graduation gap year, traveling around the world.</p>
<p>But while he was traveling in California, his Telstra job fell through, so he needed another option. He was always curious about Silicon Valley, so he quickly put out feelers for interviews in the area. Only one company responded: Google. Fortunately, he got the job and started in 2006 on the Google Search Appliance (GSA) team.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_53" title="53"/><figure>
<img alt="" class="" src="image_fi/502680c07/f07003.png"/>
<figcaption><p>Ficus and Iliyan debugging . . . something in August of 2007 (photo courtesy Brian Swetland)</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>GSA was one of the products that Google thought they’d make their money on early on, when their main product was the search engine. They sold a rack-mounted piece of hardware to companies that would index their internal documents. It extended the power of Google’s internet search into companies’ internal websites. But then Google got into the ad business, and GSA quickly became less of a focus. By the time Nick joined the team, the product was not being as actively pursued as it once was, but Nick admitted that “It was a fantastic way for a new engineer to learn the Google search stack.”</p>
<p>In the Summer of 2007, he attended the first presentation from the Android team to the rest of Google on what they were doing. Nick was hooked. “I had no relevant background. I was one of the first people who joined the team who had not worked on consumer electronics before, who had not worked on platform level stuff like San and Rebecca and Mike,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-15" id="c07-footnoteref-15">15</a></sup> who came from the Google platforms team. I only had one and a half years of serious professional experience.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_54" title="54"/>“But I came to them, and I was like: ‘This is awesome. I’ll work on anything. What do you need help with?’</p>
<p>“Brian said: ‘Bluetooth!’</p>
<p>“I knew they were too ambitious, and that they’d fail. I told my girlfriend and my Mum: ‘No way it’ll work. But the people are great and I’ll learn a lot.’”</p>
<p>Nick took on Bluetooth and quickly owned it. “It was such a steep learning curve that once I began to catch on, I was stuck with it.” He had to make Bluetooth work not only as a driver, but through the platform and application layers of Android. One of the hardest, and continuous, parts of the job was to make it work correctly with the wide variety of peripheral Bluetooth devices in the world.</p>
<p>“Most Bluetooth peripherals ship with oodles of ‘quirks’ (bugs), and never see a firmware update. So we had to work around the issues. I came up with a simple policy—every time a Bluetooth interoperability bug was found, I would purchase the device, add it to the collection at my desk, and include it as part of my manual testing. Pretty soon I had two extra desks jam-packed with Bluetooth devices. I’d keep them all plugged in charging—this ensured I didn’t lose obscure chargers, and that I never had to wait to charge a device before running a test. On more than one occasion I had to clear them all out when we got word of a fire warden inspection, due to all the daisy-chained chargers.</p>
<p>“The car-kits were a bit harder since you can’t fit a car in an office. But I soon discovered the major automotive manufacturers would happily ship me Pelican cases containing the guts of a car’s infotainment system so that I could test against the relevant hardware from my desk. They overflowed my desk and into various corners of the hallway.”</p>
<p>Nick’s manager was Brian Swetland. Swetland was, like many managers in those early Android days, not very hands-on. This included resisting sync meetings with the people on his team, as Nick recalled: “I remember a few weeks in, asking if we’d ever have a 1-on-1. He didn’t seem too happy with the question, but said I was welcome to schedule one. I did. He turned up ten minutes late and his first words were ‘I $#^&amp;()# hate 1-on-1s. . . . ’ We didn’t have 1-on-1s after that.</p>
<p>“Yet I remember Brian as one of my favorite managers to work for. His systems knowledge was second to none. He was generous with scope and responsibility and did not micro-manage. He was dedicated to building the phone and was tremendously loyal and good to his people. Working for Brian was a highlight of my career.”</p>

<h2 id="h1-502680c07-0006">San Mehat and the SD Robot</h2>
<blockquote class="Epigraph" epub:type="epigraph">
<p class="Epigraph">It’s a hundred degrees, it’s summertime, I’m looking at this phone and I’m listening to this person say garbage over and over again.</p>
<p class="EpigraphSource">—San Mehat</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="BodyFirst">More help for drivers, and system bringup overall, arrived in the form of San Mehat. San joined Swetland’s team in 2007, around the same time as Nick, in the run up to the SDK<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-16" id="c07-footnoteref-16">16</a></sup> release.</p>
<p>San learned programming when he was a kid by typing randomly on a keyboard. His parents had a computer store in their basement, where he’d play around on the machines. “I was frustrated one day and I just mashed on the keyboard. By accident, I hit ctrl-C, and that dumped me to this prompt, and I had no idea what that was. Start typing stuff, it says ‘Syntax Error.’ <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_56" title="56"/>I’m like, ‘What does that mean?’ I type something else, it says, ‘Undefined Function Error.’ I’m like, ‘What does that mean?’” His cousin suggested that he type ‘LIST,’ and the BASIC code for the game he was playing printed out on the screen.</p>
<p>San’s approach to learning programming ended up being a great experience in building drivers. A lot of the work in writing hardware drivers is figuring out what the hardware can do and how to get it to do it. Much of that work is experimentation, to understand how the hardware works and what the rules and protocols are to talk to it. San was figuring out how those rules worked from the beginning, by typing randomly onto the computers in his parents’ basement just to see what happened.</p>
<p>He continued his programming education in childhood with hobby projects, like cracking software copy protection schemes. He did this as a workaround for having limited access to games, since Canada didn’t have a strong software marketplace at that time. He kept programming through high school and afterwards by working on kernels and drivers for chips and other hardware systems, always learning more about how to make the software talk to the hardware.</p>
<p>San didn’t go to college. Ironically, it was an internship created to show kids the advantage of going to college that convinced him not to. </p>
<p>He got an internship (which led to a summer job) working with Bell Northern Research (BNR) on a CPU simulator, where he learned new programming languages and internals of processors. He was so enthusiastic about the work that he wanted to eventually work at BNR, but he realized that his grades in high school would never get him into the kind of college he needed to go to to get a job there. So he decided to skip that step and do it all on his own instead, and started an Internet Service Provider (ISP) with some friends. Along the way, he kept hacking on operating systems and random pieces of hardware, building up the skills that make a good driver developer.</p>
<p>“Give me a weird piece of hardware that you don’t really know how it works, and give me some piece of software that can make it work. Between taking apart the software and analyzing the hardware, I can reverse-engineer and create another driver that works.”</p>
<p>In 2005, San joined the platforms group at Google, where he wrote drivers for custom hardware. In 2007, he moved over to Android to work on Swetland’s systems team.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_57" title="57"/>“I joined to work on the G1. Initially, that was in the form of the ‘frankenboard,’ the Qualcomm ‘surfboard,’ which was this big, crazy prototype phone board, which was the MSM chipset<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-17" id="c07-footnoteref-17">17</a></sup> on a big breakout. It was like a phone, but exploded out with all kinds of test points, so they could load code into it and do all kinds of stuff.”</p>
<figure>
<img alt="" class="" src="image_fi/502680c07/f07005.png"/>
<figcaption><p>San performing thermal testing on a battery (with a lighter), in February of 2008. The Qualcomm “surfboard” for the processor in the G1 is on the desk, in the background. (Picture courtesy Brian Swetland.)</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When he started on the team, San’s main job was bringup. “Bringup at that time was the really, really low-level stuff. The clock control and power rail, power control.” That first system, the G1, was unusually complicated. There were actually <em>two</em> CPUs on it, one controlled by Qualcomm’s controller chip (an ARM 9), and one controlled by Android (an ARM 11). Booting the G1 required first booting the Qualcomm chip, then booting the Android chip.</p>
<p>“My job was to figure out how to build the drivers. I had to figure out how to have these two things talk to each other. Then get the clock control hooked up, get the power rails hooked up so we could start turning on peripherals, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_58" title="58"/>like the SD<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-18" id="c07-footnoteref-18">18</a></sup> controller so that the SD card could come up, and the graphics controller. So I did all the low-level nitty-gritty stuff, and then moved on to the SD Card.”</p>
<p>The SD card on the G1 presented an interesting problem. First, the SD card was useful for two separate things: storage and Wi-Fi. SD cards are mostly thought of as removable storage. But at the time, SD was also sometimes used to provide Wi-Fi (the card would have a Wi-Fi chip instead of memory hardware). </p>
<p>Getting SD to work was important, because it controlled both of these areas. But it was difficult. “No one [on the Android team] knew how SD cards worked. You couldn’t get the specs on SD cards, because to get the specs you had to join the SD association, and they wouldn’t let you do anything open source.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-19" id="c07-footnoteref-19">19</a></sup> So I had to reverse-engineer the SD card, the SD card protocol, and the SD IO protocol [for Wi-Fi], and reverse-engineer a bunch of drivers, to figure out how to write my own driver. I spent months figuring out how to make it work.”</p>
<p>San got SD working (for both storage and Wi-Fi), but there was a problem. The SD card on the G1 was very accessible to the user, so it could be popped in or out at any time. “Someone had decided that having the SD card on the side, hot-swappable, was a good idea. If you try to pull a hard drive in and out of a Linux system, you’re gonna have a bad time. This was the worst: device ripped out with almost no warning. You could be writing to the disk. Maybe you took a picture thirty seconds ago, so those buffers were still in the OS page cache, and they’re not gonna get written out for another thirty seconds.”</p>
<p>There was a cover on the G1’s SD Card slot that users had to open before popping the card out. Opening that cover sent a signal into the system, which could be used as a cue to quickly get everything into a stable state in case the user popped the card out. But it was difficult to find all of the places in the code where this needed to happen. To make things worse, debugging the situation required a lot of tedious card-popping. Over, and over, and over. Eventually, San asked for help.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_59" title="59"/>He reached out to Andy: “‘Hey, you’re into robots. Do we have someone that could make me a robot that could do this?’ He hooked me up with someone. I told them what I needed: a little bot that allows me, through software, to control how it goes in and out, and then I would create a little closed-loop test. That allowed me to track down all of these bugs.” San used the SD card robot to chase those bugs one by one until the system worked reliably.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="h1-502680c07-0007">Post-G1: Sapphire and Droid</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">After the G1 shipped, San started work on the device code-named “Sapphire,” which would become the T-Mobile G2 MyTouch. The main work for that device was performance. “It was slow as shit. It was a little bit faster than the G1, but at the same time, Romain,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-20" id="c07-footnoteref-20">20</a></sup> bless his heart, and all these other turkeys [in the platform and apps teams] were putting all this crazy thicker software on top of it. So switching apps, it was always janky and laggy. I spent a lot of time on that project optimizing the kernel. So it was really lots of performance improvements. It was kind of rinse and repeat.”</p>
<p>After the G2 shipped, San’s next challenge was the Motorola Droid. One of the problems that he had to deal with was handling power-off scenarios, which was . . . complicated. “These little bastards have like thirty different <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_60" title="60"/>power domains in them, and they’re all individually controlled. To turn the thing off, it’s a delicate dance of: <em>this</em> off first, wait so long, <em>this</em> off, then <em>this</em> off, then <em>this</em> off . . . All the way, as you’re going down, the phone is getting dumber and dumber.</p>
<p>“The failure case on Droid was this: the phone would idle to sleep, or you would turn it off, and you would get a phone call at the same time and your phone would never ring. We would be going down these power states and we would stop listening to the modem because we would turn that off. The modem would try to wake us up, but we’re not listening to the modem anymore; we’re committed to going to sleep. So we go to sleep, and the modem’s like ‘But, but, but, but . . . !’</p>
<p>“We realized eventually that the hardware was missing a wire between the modem and the CPU to actually tell it to wake up.” It was way too late<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-21" id="c07-footnoteref-21">21</a></sup> to change the hardware, so they ended up hacking around the problem by sending the wakeup signal on wires used for other parts of the system.</p>
<p>Another part of working on the Droid involved a bug that San chased in the Wi-Fi system, which was causing hiccups in video. “There was that Miss America pageant with that very controversial comment about marriage between a man and a woman. Hiroshi comes into my office and was like, ‘We got this big problem. YouTube videos are glitching, only over Wi-Fi.’ I’m like ‘Okay, no problem, it’s probably a DMA<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-22" id="c07-footnoteref-22">22</a></sup> thing. Give me a reference video.’”</p>
<p>Hiroshi gave him the video and the time at which the glitch occurred, which happened to be that awkward segment of the Miss America pageant. San spent 2 days debugging it, listening to that same video segment over and over. “Whenever I hear someone mention Miss America, I get this visceral [feeling of] being in Walnut Creek, it’s a hundred degrees, it’s summertime, I’m looking at this phone and I’m listening to this person say garbage over and over again.”</p>

<blockquote class="Epigraph" epub:type="epigraph">
<p class="Epigraph">We built this safe. We just forgot the walls.</p>
<p class="EpigraphSource">—Rebecca Zavin</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="BodyFirst">The systems team needed more reinforcements for the push to ship 1.0. Rebecca Zavin joined the team in early 2008.</p>
<p>Rebecca started programming much later than many of her teammates on Android; she didn’t really get into it until college. She always figured she’d become a doctor, so she went to college to get a pre-med degree in chemical engineering. That’s when she discovered that she hated chemistry. In the meantime, she got a job in the computer science department at the college, helping set up a computer lab. She started hanging out in that department more and more. Once she started taking classes in CS, she was hooked.</p>
<p>After college, Rebecca went to grad school, and eventually joined Google, working with San in the platforms team. About a year after San left her team to join the Android team, Rebecca was also up for something new. “I wanted to be a little uncomfortable. A little bit challenged.” She joined Swetland’s systems team in January of 2008, two months after the SDK shipped, and just in time for the long push up to 1.0.</p>
<p>The first day on the new team, she was in the office debugging a problem in the kernel until after 9:00 pm. “Swetland was like, ‘Alright, this is going to work.’” </p>
<p>The team had just shipped the SDK; now they needed to make everything work on a real device. Rebecca initially worked on display drivers for Android. Swetland gave her a minimal driver to start with. After banging on it for a while, she complained to him that it was really buggy. He told her it was just a prototype; she wasn’t supposed to actually use it. She said, “I wish you would have told me that. I assumed you knew what you were doing.”</p>
<p>After getting the driver to work, Rebecca moved on to work on the memory subsystem, which she continued working on for the next few years. Her goal was getting bits to flow through the system with the minimum number of copies (because copy operations are expensive). For example, if the camera takes a picture, there are a lot of pixels in a buffer somewhere that need to be sent to the GPU (the graphics processor), then to the video decoder, and finally to the display memory. The simplest implementation copies the pixels to each new subsystem along the way. This takes a long time, and a lot of memory, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_62" title="62"/>especially since pictures tend to be large (even with the more limited cameras of that time). Eventually, she made the system work with zero copies.</p>
<p>After the G1 shipped in late 2008, Rebecca started working on the next device: the Motorola Droid.</p>
<p>The Droid was an unloved project and device. The rest of the team was working on the device code-named Passion, which became the Nexus One. Passion was going to be a Google phone, with all the latest and greatest features, and the team was really excited about it. And then there was this Motorola device.</p>
<p>Rebecca said, “No one wanted to touch it. It was ugly. Everybody was really excited about Nexus One. And the Droid thing? We were left to our own devices. Shortly after, it became a big deal for the team, because it became the first Verizon launch.”<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-23" id="c07-footnoteref-23">23</a></sup></p>
<p>The chipset was from TI, which had drivers for the chips. But there was an alternate implementation of those drivers from Nokia, which Rebecca recommended that they start from. </p>
<p>“We had a three-way meeting with Motorola where I told them, ‘I don’t think we should use this TI kernel; it’s a mess. I think we should use this Nokia Kernel.’ I got a call from our TI sales guy who said, ‘Motorola called me and they said that you said our code was shit.’</p>
<p>“I said, ‘I don’t think that I used any expletives in the meeting.’”</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c07-0009">That Embarrassing Root Bug</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">One of the hallmarks of early Android development is the raw speed at which the team executed. Going from nothing to 1.0 in three years was astonishing, especially when that first release contained most of the fundamentals that would ensure that Android would soon become one of the most widely distributed operating systems in the world.</p>
<p>I have found that the probability of spilling coffee on myself is proportional to the speed at which I’m moving. There are trade-offs that come with execution speed. In those early days, everyone was running so fast that they sometimes failed to notice things that might have been caught in a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_63" title="63"/>more cautious and slower-paced environment. One of the examples of this dynamic was the famous (at least internally) “feature” of being able to reboot the phone from the chat app.</p>
<p>Jeff Sharkey and Kenny Root were external developers when 1.0 launched (they were both hired onto the Android team later on). They were tinkering with Android, even before that first release. Kenny had developed an SSH client (an app that allows you to log into a remote computer). Kenny’s version had been built against an earlier, pre-1.0 version of the SDK. Jeff updated it to work against later builds of Android and added more functionality. They eventually published it as ConnectBot, one of the first applications on Android Market,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-24" id="c07-footnoteref-24">24</a></sup> where it is still the top SSH client.</p>
<p>When they were first working on ConnectBot, they received odd bug reports from some of their users. Jeff said, “We got this weird bug from someone saying they’d SSH into their server at home, type <code>reboot</code>, and their phone would reboot. We thought they must be smoking something, and closed as Not Reproducible.”<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-25" id="c07-footnoteref-25">25</a></sup></p>
<p>But the bug turned out to be totally valid, and more than a little scary for Android.</p>
<p>Rebecca Zavin said, “People discovered if you typed <code>root</code><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-26" id="c07-footnoteref-26">26</a></sup> in Gchat<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-27" id="c07-footnoteref-27">27</a></sup> you could get root access on your phone. And then people realized that it also worked when you typed <code>shutdown</code>. Or <code>reboot</code>.”</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_64" title="64"/>Rebecca explained how the bug came to be. “The keyboard events were sent to a console that was left open. You always wanted to have some serial console.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-28" id="c07-footnoteref-28">28</a></sup> It was convenient. So we put the root console there for debugging . . . and should have made a note to turn it off.</p>
<p>“At some point, we had this ongoing bug where we used to have the framebuffer console support there, so you could switch to a mode where you could see the log, same as you can on your Linux PC. We had this recurring bug where you’d get a black square in the upper left corner. It was a timer issue. Some race condition<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-29" id="c07-footnoteref-29">29</a></sup> would cause the cursor to blink when you came back to graphics. So I’d get Steve Horowitz [telling me], ‘That black square. I got a black square!’</p>
<p>“After spending a lot of time trying to fix the problem, I was like, ‘Let’s just turn off the framebuffer console. Why do we need to see the kernel log on the screen on the device? This is stupid. Let’s just turn it off and then we don’t have to deal with this problem.’</p>
<p>“But when we turned off the console, it was still there [just invisible]. We all were like: ‘Uh-oh, oops!’</p>
<p>“We built this safe. We just forgot the walls.”</p>
<p>Jeff said, “The person typing <code>reboot</code> into ConnectBot was effectively typing it into both their remote server, and into their phone, which explains the surprising reboot.”</p>
<p>Nick Pelly remembered the bug: “We thought it was some subtle, clever hack that someone had figured out. No, no, no: every single keyboard press you made was going into root shell.”</p>
<p>Kenny Root added, “This probably opened the way for the first ‘root’ of the G1, but I promise it wasn’t named after me.”</p>

<p>There are other examples where Android missed some of the details along the way; everyone was running very, very fast and there was a lot to do to just get things working. Fortunately, the platform has survived long enough that the team has been able to go back and fix the problems over time. At least the ones we know about.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c07-0010">Mike Chan and the B Team</h2>
<blockquote class="Epigraph" epub:type="epigraph">
<p class="Epigraph">We felt we were going to change the world. And we did.</p>
<p class="EpigraphSource">—Mike Chan</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="BodyFirst">The final member to join the systems team prior to 1.0 was Mike Chan.</p>
<p>Mike first wanted to become a programmer as early as middle school. When he saw the game <em>Lode Runner</em>, he wanted to write video games when he grew up. That dream didn’t last long, however; in high school, he was more interested in administering computer systems. But in college, he took programming classes and returned to his original plan of becoming a programmer. Landing his first job out of school at Google sealed his fate.</p>
<p>He started at Google in 2006, joining the platforms team that San and Rebecca worked on. Like them, he also eventually transferred to the Android <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_66" title="66"/>group, arriving a month after Rebecca, in February of 2008. The SDK had already launched, but there was still a lot of work to do to get the product to 1.0.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c07-0011">Security Blanket</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Mike’s starter project was to make Android secure prior to shipping 1.0. No pressure.</p>
<p>Android was built from the start with security in mind. Swetland specifically wanted to implement a more secure model for Android than he had worked with at Danger. Those Hiptop devices were even more resource constrained and didn’t have hardware facilities to protect apps from each other, so they relied on software mechanisms. Brian insisted that all Android hardware had to have an MMU<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-30" id="c07-footnoteref-30">30</a></sup> to provide hardware security instead.</p>
<p>Another important aspect of security on the platform was treating all applications as separate “users” on the device. On other operating systems, users would be protected from each other, but not from themselves. So, for example, you could create a user account on a PC and the data that you created in that account would be protected from other users on the system. However, any application that you installed would run as you, so all of your applications would have access to all data in your account. There was an implicit trust between any user and all of the applications they installed.</p>
<p>But the Android engineers felt (rightly so) that the applications on the device should not be inherently trusted. So rather than having apps running as the user who installed them, Brian’s design had each app run as a separate, unique user on the device. This approach guaranteed (through the Linux kernel mechanism of user IDs, or UIDs) that apps had no automatic access to the data of any other application on the same device, even though those other applications were installed by the same device owner. Brian provided a low level service to create, destroy, or run-as-a-user. Dianne Hackborn, on the framework team, integrated this service with higher-level application permissions and built out the policies for application UID management.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_67" title="67"/>This system of hardware-protected processes and applications-as-users was mostly set up and working, but there were many details that needed to be polished. For example, although the application processes were protected from each other, many of the built-in system processes were running as users with elevated permissions, giving them access to more than they strictly needed on the device.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the iPhone had recently been jailbroken,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-31" id="c07-footnoteref-31">31</a></sup> which was a good reminder to complete this security work before they shipped 1.0.</p>
<p>Mike thought the project was not only a great introduction to Android and security models of operating systems; it was also an introduction to Swetland’s management style, “Brian has an interesting way of throwing you into the deep end and figuring out if you can sink or swim.”</p>
<p>As starter projects go, it was . . . a big one. Not only was there pressure to get it done, because it clearly had to happen before shipping the first device, but it was something that affected everyone else building the platform and apps on Android at the time. The pressure was on. “As I was trying to make changes, I was breaking stuff left and right. It was super painful. All the teams would be complaining that something’s broken and I’m trying to fix this as fast as I can, trying to anticipate it.</p>
<p>“Steve Horowitz [Android’s engineering director at the time] was all over me. ‘You broke the build!’ I’m like, ‘I know, Steve. I know I broke the build. I’m trying to fix it now. Having you stand there is not going to make me fix it any faster.’</p>
<p>“That was a trial by fire. Learned a bunch of stuff, touched all parts of the system, and broke everything.”</p>
<p>Mike’s next project was improving battery life. At that time, coming up to the launch of the G1, the battery life was awful. To make things worse, all of the teams were blaming the other teams for the problem. “Apps team would blame the framework team. The framework team would blame the systems team. The systems team would blame the apps team.”</p>
<p>Andy didn’t care whose fault it was, he just wanted it fixed. He gave the problem to Swetland, who gave it to Mike.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_68" title="68"/>Brian asked, “How much do you know about power management?”</p>
<p>Mike said, “I don’t know anything, Brian.”</p>
<p>“Well I suggest you start learning, because you’re in charge of this thing now.”</p>
<p>Mike quickly realized that part of the problem was one of expectations. “The problem I explained to everyone was: You’re telling me we have to have just as good battery life as the iPhone. We have this capability to run all these apps in the background,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-32" id="c07-footnoteref-32">32</a></sup> the hardware that we have has a bigger screen, we run background tasks, we were the first to do 3G, and we have a physically smaller battery.”</p>
<p>One of the main things that Mike did was add instrumentation to the system to know where the power was going. Prior to this, they could see the battery was being drained, but had no idea who was doing what, so it was difficult to find and fix the root problems. Once they knew where the problems were, they could go address them.</p>
<p>Mike also had ongoing debates with Dianne, on the framework team. Many of the battery problems were coming from poor behavior in apps, which would do things like hold a wake lock<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-33" id="c07-footnoteref-33">33</a></sup> too long, but the users would just blame Android overall. “I was pushing for a more explicit system where if an app goes into the background, you force-release the resource. So basically a less flexible platform. Dianne was under the firm belief that it’s not the platform’s fault, it’s the developers’, and the right fix is to educate all these app developers.</p>
<p>“This was a battle we had for years.”</p>
<p>The other project that Mike worked on was the <em>governor</em>.</p>
<p>A governor in an OS is the mechanism by which the speed, or frequency, of the CPU is changed to save power. For example, if your CPU is running really fast, it is consuming more power and thus more battery. But if the device is idle at the time, that’s a large and unnecessary waste of battery power. The governor exists to detect these different runtime modes and scale the CPU frequency accordingly.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_69" title="69"/>When the G1 launched, the only governor in effect was the <em>ondemand</em> governor that was part of core Linux. It was a simple system with just two settings: full-speed and idle. This was better than nothing, but wasn’t good enough for Android’s purposes, especially since the heuristics for that governor were tuned for Linux running on server or desktop machines, not for the more constrained world of mobile devices.</p>
<p>Mike started playing with the governor in the late stages of 1.0, but had to put that project aside after an unfortunate incident of a demo that Andy gave to the Google execs.</p>
<p>Mike had checked in a change that inadvertently made the phone painfully slow. “I was experimenting on master<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-34" id="c07-footnoteref-34">34</a></sup> with the conservative governor, which skewed very, very heavy towards saving power at the cost of performance. The phone was pretty much unusable.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Andy had a monthly review with Larry and Sergey to show them the status of this project. Andy flashed<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-35" id="c07-footnoteref-35">35</a></sup> a build of master onto a phone and went off to his meeting.</p>
<p>At the meeting, he showed a demo using that build, which . . . did not go well.</p>
<p>“He came back, he was pissed off.”</p>
<p>This incident was a great learning experience for Mike. On one hand, he learned the importance of testing his changes before pushing them on everyone that might use that build. But also, he learned how important it is to have a supportive manager.</p>
<p>“Brian stood toe-to-toe with Andy in the hallway, screaming back that it was his fault for using master without any testing. We’re doing all of this stuff to launch Android on time, we don’t have the time to make sure your <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_70" title="70"/>demos are perfect. I never saw anyone yell at Andy. He never brought my name up. He knew it was my code.</p>
<p>“He later came back to my desk and calmly told me to revert all my changes and not touch this until after we shipped.”</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c07-0012">The B Team</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Mike joined Rebecca on the Droid project. The systems team was split between the people working on the Passion (which became the Nexus One) and the Droid. Swetland remembered, “I had decided that we needed to split the systems group into two teams to distribute work between N1 and Droid, and introduced this at our team meeting by saying, ‘We’ll need like an A team and a —’. Before I could back that up and reword it better, Erik<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnote-36" id="c07-footnoteref-36">36</a></sup> completed ‘B Team!’ and much to my horror they adopted it as a badge of honor (possibly also because it embarrassed me).” The people on the Passion project were mostly those people who had more familiarity with that hardware. But Rebecca joked that the Droid project had the “B Team,” because they were working on the device that the team wasn’t excited about. Passion was getting all of the love and, well, <em>passion</em> from the team at the time.</p>
<p>Mike said, “Everyone assumed Nexus was going to be the big phone that was going to land: the first Google-branded phone, no keyboard, really slick design, OLED screen. It was a good phone.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Droid hardware design was underwhelming at the time. “It was always hyped up that the design was going to be so amazing. When they finally unveiled the design, it was this ugly square thing. I remember thinking, this is just the initial prototype. There’s a new one coming with the final design. Right? No, this is the design we’re shipping with.”</p>
<p>In the end, Verizon’s branding and marketing for the Droid overshadowed anything that Google did for the Nexus One. More on that in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 45">Chapter 45</span> (“Droid Did”).</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c07-0013">Building a Robust System</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">It’s worth reflecting on the approach and accomplishments of the systems team before moving onto the rest of the software stack. For one thing, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_71" title="71"/>everything they built was fundamental to the rest of the OS even being able to power up, much less function. But also, the approach they took to their work was indicative of an overall theme in Android of doing a complete (if quick) job, beyond the immediate needs of the day and looking forward to what they envisioned (or hoped) Android would eventually become.</p>
<p>For example, they didn’t just work on the one or two devices currently in the pipeline. At the same time that the rest of Android was focused on the Sooner and Dream phones being developed prior to 1.0, the systems team was getting Android to work on completely different devices, making it more robust and flexible for the future world of manufacturers with completely different hardware.</p>
<p>Also, the team didn’t just plug together drivers from hardware manufacturers and ship the result; they wrote everything from the ground up to be solid and robust.</p>
<p>Nick talked about this dynamic on the team: “Why wasn’t the systems team just an integration team? Integration is more about plugging things together to make them work, taking the drivers from manufacturers and getting Android to work on them, rather than writing the drivers themselves.</p>

<figcaption><p>The port of Android to this Nokia device was what Swetland called “the holiday port,” which happened over Thanksgiving weekend of 2007. (Picture courtesy Brian Swetland.)</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>“We were writing a whole bunch of device drivers that many other companies wouldn’t have written; they would have just taken the reference Linux driver that the silicon provider hands over. Back in that day, those reference Linux drivers were total shit. It was a key decision that we weren’t just going to take those reference drivers; we were going to rewrite them to be <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_72" title="72"/>at a quality that could be upstreamed and that we could stand by, maintain, and support. The rest of the ecosystem could follow our lead and fork our drivers or just reuse them.</p>

</figure>
<p>“We ended up with much higher quality drivers. Sure, we had some bugs, but we got to stability. If you have shitty drivers, it costs you stability—peripherals will randomly fail, the device will reboot. And it’s very hard to do power management correctly without good drivers and without wake locks and things like that; you just destroy the battery life.</p>
<p>“That was one of the key decisions that I think largely Brian was responsible for that set us on the right path. We’re building out a high-quality codebase here, and we’re doing things the right way.” </p>

<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnoteref-12" id="c07-footnote-12">12.</a></sup>  Forking is a common term in software, where a particular version of some system is copied and then altered, essentially causing a fork in the road where there are now two (or even more) versions of the system with different features and functionality. It’s an unpopular approach in the open source community, because everyone should contribute to the one-true version instead. But sometimes, as in the wake lock example, you may need to fork just to make progress while the larger community decides what to do.</p></aside>

<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnoteref-14" id="c07-footnote-14">14.</a></sup>  Sooner was the original device that Android was targeting for 1.0, with the G1 (codenamed “Dream”) being the second device. The Sooner was eventually dropped, which is described in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 37">Chapter 37</span> (“Competition”).</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnoteref-15" id="c07-footnote-15">15.</a></sup>  San, Rebecca, and Mike, who also worked on the systems team, are introduced in upcoming sections.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnoteref-16" id="c07-footnote-16">16.</a></sup>  Software Development Kit: This is a general term for application development. It’s a bundle of whatever tools, libraries, and APIs developers need to write, build, and run their applications. Android’s first public SDK was released in the Fall of 2007.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnoteref-17" id="c07-footnote-17">17.</a></sup>  MSM = Mobile Station Modem, a Qualcomm System on Chip (SoC) that integrated all of the mobile hardware needed.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnoteref-18" id="c07-footnote-18">18.</a></sup>  SD = Secure Digital, an abbreviation for SD Card, which is still used for removable storage in things like cameras (and some phones).</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnoteref-19" id="c07-footnote-19">19.</a></sup>  This was an overall requirement for Android that spanned everything the team did. If the code couldn’t be open sourced, then it couldn’t be part of the platform.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnoteref-20" id="c07-footnote-20">20.</a></sup>  San is talking about Romain Guy, whom we shall see more of in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 14">Chapter 14</span> (“UI Toolkit”).</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnoteref-21" id="c07-footnote-21">21.</a></sup>  This is a fundamental difference between hardware and software development. If you find a bug late in the cycle before software ships, you can still fix it. In fact, you can even fix bugs after it ships, as long as you have a way to get that update to your users. But with hardware, that bug is there to stay; you cannot usually re-spin a piece of hardware, at least not without causing massive delays and costs to reproduce the hardware. So usually, hardware bugs are handled by figuring out software workarounds.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnoteref-22" id="c07-footnote-22">22.</a></sup>  DMA = Direct Memory Access, a type of memory that can be accessed without directly involving the CPU. This is useful for memory-intensive hardware subsystems such as storage and displays, which can read and write memory directly while the CPU is busy with other tasks.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnoteref-23" id="c07-footnote-23">23.</a></sup>  That launch involved a lot of marketing dollars, a lot of publicity, and, eventually, a lot of Android devices being sold and used. There’s more about the Droid story later, in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 45">Chapter 45</span> (“Droid Did”).</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnoteref-24" id="c07-footnote-24">24.</a></sup>  Android Market was the name of the original application store. It was later renamed to Google Play Store.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnoteref-25" id="c07-footnote-25">25.</a></sup>  Bugs for a software product are filed in some kind of bug database. That’s where the engineer(s) add more information to the bug that helps diagnose the problems. Bugs are ideally closed (eventually). In the best case, they are closed as Fixed. In the worst case (for the person that filed the bug), they are closed as Working As Intended (meaning, “Yes, you are correct, that’s the way it behaves. And we think that’s the correct behavior.”). But the most frustrating closure case, for everyone, is Not Reproducible, which means, “We believe you . . . but we can’t see the problem on our devices, and we can’t fix it if we can’t cause it to happen in the first place.”</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnoteref-26" id="c07-footnote-26">26.</a></sup>  Having root access on a computer allows you to do things that you can’t as a regular user, like delete important files, or shut down or reboot the system. You can’t usually get root access by just typing <span class="LiteralFootnote"><code>root</code></span> (hackers love a backdoor security hole in a system, but being able to get root so easily is less of a backdoor and more like a front door which has been left ajar).</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnoteref-27" id="c07-footnote-27">27.</a></sup>  Gchat was the informal name used for Google Talk. Gchat was eventually replaced by the Hangouts application and, more recently, Google Chat.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnoteref-28" id="c07-footnote-28">28.</a></sup>  A serial console is a terminal window, like the DOS window on Windows or the Terminal application on a Mac, where you can type commands into the system.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnoteref-29" id="c07-footnote-29">29.</a></sup>  Race conditions are a common cause of software bugs. The underlying problem is two different, potentially unrelated, parts of the software (or of the whole system) trying to access the same resource at the same time. But since they are running independently (on different threads in the same process, or even in different processes), it’s impossible to predict which one will get there first. The general approach is for the code to be flexible enough to handle any possible ordering of accessors. The problem is that it is easy to not think about ordering problems in random spots in the code, and race conditions can be infrequent, so you might never see them occur, they just happen elsewhere, when you don’t happen to be watching the device screen. Which is also a type of race condition.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnoteref-30" id="c07-footnote-30">30.</a></sup>  MMU: Memory Management Unit. This piece of hardware translates from the memory addresses used by a process to the actual physical memory on the device. This approach ensures that one process cannot read or write memory (intentionally or not) in any other process because it has no physical access to it.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnoteref-31" id="c07-footnote-31">31.</a></sup>  Jailbreaking refers to modifying the OS to remove or change software restrictions on the device, enabling things like installing applications not available on the App Store (known as sideloading).</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnoteref-32" id="c07-footnote-32">32.</a></sup>  At the time, the iPhone did not allow this. It was a distinguishing feature of Android in the early days.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnoteref-33" id="c07-footnote-33">33.</a></sup>  Wake locks (which are discussed earlier) keep the system from going to sleep. They are a powerful and necessary part of the system, but can cause serious power problems when used incorrectly, because they keep the system awake when it would otherwise go to sleep and use less power.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnoteref-34" id="c07-footnote-34">34.</a></sup>  The “master” branch is the main one into which all code changes go. There are often other branches of the build, for specific devices or situations, but master is where the main product code is checked in, built, tested, and released. Checking a change into master is how you ensure that everyone gets it in their builds and devices (for better or worse).</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c07-footnoteref-35" id="c07-footnote-35">35.</a></sup>  Flashing is the term used in Android to mean installing a build (Android devices use “flash memory,” thus the term). If you had a build on your computer, you could flash from the computer to a phone (with the phone plugged into the computer on a USB cable). There were also “flash stations” set up in the Android building where you could flash any of the recent builds onto a device. It was useful to be able to install different builds for testing purposes, or sometimes because the build you flashed previously was . . . not a good one, as this story illustrates.</p></aside>

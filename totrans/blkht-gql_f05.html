<p class="BodyFirst">Many people have contributed to the success of this book, both directly, through advice and guidance, and indirectly, by publishing GraphQL tools, educational resources, blog posts, and cutting-edge research. We would like to thank those with whom we’ve worked closely. Without their patience, support, sacrifices, and guidance, releasing this book would have been an impossible mission.</p>
<p>Thank you to Limor-Petersil Farhi, Dolev’s wife and partner, who supported him throughout this journey. Without her unconditional support and encouragement, this whole process would have been much harder to complete. Writing a book has been on Dolev’s to-do list for a long time, and he feels beyond lucky to have such a partner in his life who enabled him to do so. Thank you for stepping up and taking care of everything else while he was hacking both GraphQL and Microsoft Word to get this book out the door.</p>
<p>Thank you to Nick’s loving wife, Natalia Aleks, for the endless support throughout his career, and especially in this adventure. From day one, her encouragement and patience was instrumental in the development of this book. Nick is honored to have her by his side.</p>
<p>We thank Corey Ball, author of <em>Hacking APIs</em> and the senior manager of penetration testing at Moss Adams, who took on the tough job of reviewing this book for technical accuracies, for his excellent security and book-writing experience, which helped us tremendously as we were getting started.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xx" title="xx"/>A big thank-you to Leonardo Losoviz, developer and maintainer of the GraphQL API for WordPress, who provided us with a tremendous amount of insightful information about the GraphQL ecosystem. Through his open source contributions, we learned a whole lot about the less-explored surfaces of GraphQL.</p>
<p>Thank you to Dotan Simha and Uri Goldstein, founders of The Guild, for their guidance and excellent work in building free and open source GraphQL tools for the entire community’s benefit. You are not only great engineers, but also effectively trailblazing the GraphQL space and making GraphQL APIs safer to use for everyone in the community.</p>
<p>To the entire No Starch Press team, thank you for giving us the opportunity to translate our experience into a full-blown security book. We’d like to extend our thanks to Frances Saux, our amazing editor, who was an excellent resource for us as we went through this book-writing roller-coaster ride, and to Bill Pollock, who gave us the opportunity to team up with No Starch Press and make our dream a reality.</p>

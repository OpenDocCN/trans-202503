<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="DropCap">T</span>he hard part about legacy modernization is the system around the system. The organization, its communication structures, its politics, and its incentives are all intertwined with the technical product in such a way that to move the product, you must do it by turning the gears of this other, complex, undocumented system.</p>&#13;
<p>Part of the reason legacy modernizations fail so often is that human beings are incentivized to mute or otherwise remove feedback loops that establish accountability. We are often unable to stop this because we insist on talking about that problem as a moral failing instead of an unconscious bias. Engineering organizations that maintain a separation between operations and development, for example, inevitably find that their development teams design solutions so that when they go wrong, they impact the operations team first and most severely. Meanwhile, their operations team builds processes that throw barriers in front of development, passing the negative consequences of that to those teams. These are both examples of muted feedback loops. The implementers of a decision cannot feel the impacts of their decisions as directly as some other group.</p>&#13;
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="218" id="Page_218"/>One of the reasons the DevOps and SRE movements have had such a beneficial effect on software development is that they seek to re-establish accountability. If product engineering teams play a role in running and maintaining their own infrastructure, they are the ones who feel the impact of their own decisions. When they build something that doesn’t scale, they are the ones who are awakened at 3 <span class="KepCaps">am</span> with a page. Making software engineers responsible for the health of their infrastructure instead of a separate operations team unmutes the feedback loop.</p>&#13;
<p>But anyone who has ever tried to run an SRE or DevOps team will tell you that maintaining the expectation that product engineering teams should be responsible for their infrastructure is easier said than done. There will always be a need for specialists on the infrastructure side of things—either because the organization is running its own data centers and needs the hardware expertise or because the tools that engineers interact with to maintain their infrastructure need themselves to be maintained—and, therefore, there is always someone to dump responsibilities on.</p>&#13;
<p>People do not mute feedback loops because they do not care. They mute feedback loops because human beings can hold only so much information in their minds at one point. Keeping a feedback loop open means listening for information from it, which means first considering what information might come back and how to interpret it. Developers mute operations because they usually do not understand the details of how infrastructure works. Engineers typically mute the feedback loop from the business side of the organization, because that feedback is delivered in metrics they’re not trained on and struggle to extract insight from. Each group is capable of learning the language of the other, but how many disciplines should a single person be expected to master to do her job? When running a system, engineers must consider resource usage, capacity projections, test coverage, inheritance structure, lines of code, and more. Is it any wonder most restrict their scope to the massive technical complexity directly relevant to what their job actually is?</p>&#13;
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="219" id="Page_219"/>A high-functioning organization cannot have all feedback loops open all the time. It must decide which loops have the biggest impact on operational excellence. Throughout this book, I have emphasized thinking about modernization projects not in terms of technical correctness but in terms of value add because it re-establishes the most important feedback loop: Is the technology serving the needs of its users?</p>&#13;
<p>Meetings, reports, and dialogues are the least efficient feedback loops. Feedback loops are most effective when the operator <em>feels</em> the impact, rather than just hearing about it. That’s because people are naturally inclined to misinterpret information to suit what they already want to believe. It is more difficult to do that when the feedback is delivered in the form of inconvenience, disruption, interruptions, and additional work.</p>&#13;
<p>Nevertheless, since we cannot have all feedback loops open all the time, traditional communication can help fill in where impacts are not serious enough to warrant an open loop. Designing a modernization effort is about iteration, and iteration is about feedback. Therefore, the real challenge of legacy modernization is not the technical tasks, but making sure the feedback loops are open in the critical places and communication is orderly everywhere else.</p>&#13;
<p>As a general rule, the discretion to make decisions should be delegated to the people who must implement those decisions. If you are not contributing code or being woken up in the middle of the night to answer a page, have the good sense to remember that no matter how important your job is, you are not the implementor. You do not operate the system, but you can find the operators and make sure they have the air cover they need to be successful. Empower the operators.</p>&#13;
<p>It should go without saying that this requires trust. Teams are ultimately governed by trust. Leaders of large organizations do not like hearing this, because it means they will be held accountable for outcomes that are beyond their control. It is easier to cling to a popular strategy that offers guarantees. That way, if it fails, it can be passed off as a freak occurrence no leader could have prevented. There are no silver bullets with <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="220" id="Page_220"/>legacy modernization; every technique in this book could fail under the wrong conditions. I’ve done my best to describe the right conditions, and the vulnerabilities of each approach, but I am limited by my knowledge and experience, which are not (and never will be) infinite. The person in the best position to find a working strategy is the person on the ground watching the gears of the system turn.</p>&#13;
<p>Dealing with this reality gets easier when you accept failure. Failure is inevitable when attempting to change complex systems in production. There are too many moving parts, too many unknowns, and too much that needs to be fixed. Getting every single decision right is impossible. Modern engineering teams use stats like service level objectives, error budgets, and mean time to recovery to move the emphasis away from avoiding failure and toward recovering quickly. Don’t forget: a perfect record can always be broken, but resilience is an accomplishment that lasts. Embracing failure as an organization diminishes the risk of empowering the operator and gets better performance from engineers.</p>&#13;
<p>We cannot completely eliminate failure, because there’s a level of complexity where a single person—no matter how intelligent—cannot comprehend the full system. With legacy systems, we have an additional complication in the fact that some context of the system has been lost. Requirements, assumptions, and the technical limitations of the time are all undocumented. There may be abstractions buried in the platform that trip us up. Modernization teams need to rediscover the requirements and assumptions of the original system and update them for the new system, but there are limitations on how much understanding even the best modernization team can excavate. Ultimately, old software cannot be used as a specification for a new version.</p>&#13;
<p>Technology, at its core, is an artifact of human thought. So when modernizing old technology, what humans think matters quite a lot. Software engineers are smart, but they fall victim to trends and fads the same as any other profession. Pay attention to how they are incentivized. What earns them the acknowledgment of their peers? What gets people seen is <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="221" id="Page_221"/>what they will ultimately prioritize, even if those behaviors are in open conflict with the official instructions they receive from management. Technology advances in cycles with old paradigms constantly being dusted off to capture neglected segments of the market. Newer is not necessarily better. Good technology isn’t about having the most modern, most scalable, fastest, or most secure implementation; it’s about serving the needs of the user.</p>&#13;
<p>But, we also want a world where software engineers strive to make technology faster, better, and more secure. The only way we get both technology that serves the user and strives to improve continuously is by defining success up front. What does it mean to bring value, and how do we know when value has increased?</p>&#13;
<p>In the end, technology is never finished being built. The legacy modernization projects of today were the finished systems of yesterday. Computer systems cannot be expected to go unchanged for decades, because rarely is a computer isolated from the outside world. The inputs will change, the output methods will change, the networks and protocols will change, and the program that doesn’t change becomes a time bomb.</p>&#13;
<p>The best way to handle legacy modernization projects is not to need them in the first place. If the appropriate time and resources are budgeted for it, systems can be maintained in such a way that they evolve with the industry. The organizations that accomplish this ultimately understand that the organization’s scale is the upper bound of system complexity. Systems that are more complex than the team responsible for them can maintain are neglected and eventually fall apart.</p>&#13;
<p>To most software engineers, legacy systems may seem like torturous dead-end work, but the reality is systems that are not used get turned off. Working on legacy systems means working on some of the most critical systems that exist—computers that govern millions of people’s lives in enumerable ways. This is not the work of technical janitors, but battlefield surgeons. It has been the greatest honor to serve among them.</p>&#13;

    Tom Igoe, Gianluca Martino, David Mellis, and all those who maintain and update
    the Arduino ecosystem. Without your vision, thought, and hard work, none of this
    would have been possible. Once again, kudos and thanks to the KiCad team for their
    open source electronics design automation suite, which I’ve used throughout this
    book for circuit schematics.'

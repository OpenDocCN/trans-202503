- en: You’ve learned the basics of JavaScript and some powerful techniques for using
    JavaScript within web pages to create interactive applications. Now it’s time
    to put these techniques to use by building some real projects!

- en: 'This part of the book features three substantial projects that will help you
    practice what you’ve learned, show you how to develop and organize more sophisticated
    programs, and give you a taste of some of the many exciting things JavaScript
    can do. There are no dependencies between the projects, so you can work on them
    in any order you wish. Here’s a little preview of each:'

    functions, and the Canvas API by making your own version of the classic game *Pong*.
    You’ll develop two implementations of the game: one with standalone functions
    ([Chapter 10](chapter10.xhtml)) and one that uses classes and object-oriented
    design principles ([Chapter 11](chapter11.xhtml)). This will illustrate different
    ways of organizing your code.'

- en: This project introduces basic audio programming and sound synthesis techniques
    ([Chapter 12](chapter12.xhtml)), then harnesses those techniques to write a song
    using JavaScript ([Chapter 13](chapter13.xhtml)). You’ll learn about the Web Audio
    API and the Tone.js library, which simplifies the process of generating sounds.
    This will give you practice incorporating third-party JavaScript libraries into
    your applications.

- en: This project guides you through the process of developing interactive data visualizations
    with the popular D3 JavaScript library. You’ll explore how to draw with Scalable
    Vector Graphics (SVG) and use D3 to organize SVG shapes into bar charts ([Chapter
    14](chapter14.xhtml)). Then you’ll build a dynamic visualization using data retrieved
    over the internet through the GitHub Search API ([Chapter 15](chapter15.xhtml)).
    Incorporating API requests into your applications is a very common programming
    task, so the project will prepare you to write code that interfaces with real-world
    data.

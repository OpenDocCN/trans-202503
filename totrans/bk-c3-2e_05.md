**WEB FONTS**

![Image](graphics/common-01.jpg)

The features covered in this chapter are the oldest in this book, having been introduced in CSS2 many years ago—only to be dropped from the 2.1 spec owing to a lack of implementation by browser makers. Now a new generation of browsers has revived interest in improving the typographical options available to web designers, and I, for one, welcome the return of these features in CSS3\. Chief among them is the ability to specify fonts that don’t already exist on the user’s system—by utilizing the `@font-face` method—which frees designers from the yoke of the standard palette of “web-safe” system fonts that have been used for many years. Surprisingly, this capability has been available in Internet Explorer since 1997!

IE4 was the first browser to allow web fonts, but it did so with a proprietary format that prevented other browsers from following suit. Microsoft later submitted its format to the W3C for consideration as a standard, but in the meantime Firefox, Safari, and Chrome all backed a different set of formats (see “[Font Formats](ch05.html#ch05leve1sec56)” on [page 52](ch05.html#page_52)), so later versions of Internet Explorer eventually followed suit.

The CSS Fonts Module Level 3 (*[http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/)*) has Candidate Recommendation status, and most of the spec has already been implemented in modern browsers (with a couple of exceptions, which I’ll cover later), so you can consider these features safe to use.

### **The @font-face Rule**

To display web fonts on your pages, you first need to define them by using the `@font-face` rule. This rule sets the name and type of the font and provides the browser with the location of the file to use. Here’s the basic syntax:

```
  @font-face {
➊     font-family: FontName;
➋     src: ➌local('fontname'), ➍url('/path/filename.otf') ➎format('opentype');
  }
```

I’ll break this syntax down a little. First, I give the font a name with the `font-family` property (➊). This property is one you should be familiar with, although it serves a slightly different purpose inside the rule than it does when used in the declaration block for a regular selector; here, it’s used to declare a font name, not to refer to one. Just like the `font-family` property in CSS2.1, you can use multiple, space-separated words as long as you enclose them within single quotation marks.

**NOTE**
*When you define your font’s name with* `*font-family*`*, you can use the same name multiple times—in fact, sometimes you need to. I’ll discuss why shortly, in “[Defining Different Faces](ch05.html#ch05leve1sec52)” on [page 49](ch05.html#page_49).*

Next is the `src` property (➋), which tells the browser the location of the font file. This property accepts a few different values: `local` (➌) uses the name of the source font to check if the font is already installed on the user’s machine; and `url` (➍) provides a path to the font if it’s not available locally. I’ve also included the optional `format` (➎) hint, used to specify the font type; in this example, I used OpenType, but more types are available, and I’ll discuss those later in “[Font Formats](ch05.html#ch05leve1sec56)” on [page 52](ch05.html#page_52).

I can supply many different values for the `src` property by separating the values with commas, as I’ve done in the code example. This utilizes the power of the cascade to allow different fall-back values, which will come in handy in a later example.

**NOTE**
*Remember that in a font stack the browser will use the first file it encounters that can be loaded, rather than reading through all files and choosing the most recent.*

To use the font I just defined, I need only call its name in the font stack, as I’d normally do:

```
E { font-family: FontName; }
```

To illustrate a real-world example, I’ll apply the Chunk font (available to download for free from *[http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fonts/4-chunk/](http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fonts/4-chunk/)*) to an `h1` element using `@font-face`. Here’s the code I’ll use in my style sheet:

```
  @font-face {
➊     font-family: ChunkFive;
      src: ➋local('ChunkFive'), ➌url('ChunkFive.woff') ➍format('woff');
  }
➎      h1.webfont { font-family: ChunkFive, sans-serif; }
```

The first step is to name my font; I’ve chosen `ChunkFive` (➊) because I can remember it easily, but I could use any name. Next I provide values to the `src` property: `local` (➋) uses the true name of the font, `ChunkFive`, to check if it’s available on my system. Following that I enter a relative path to the font file I want to use (➌), and finally, I assign an argument of `woff` to the `format` value (➍). I explain the WOFF format in “Font Formats” on [page 52](ch05.html#page_52).

**NOTE**
*You can usually find a font’s true name by using a font management application or by right-clicking the font file to view the font information.*

In the last line (➎), I include my newly defined font in the font stack using the name value I defined inside the `@font-face` rule and apply it to all `h1` elements with a `class` of `webfont`. To see how that displays, here’s a quick comparison using the following markup:

```
<h1>Alas, poor Yorick!</h1>
<h1 class="webfont">Alas, poor Yorick!</h1>
```

You can see the output in [Figure 5-1](ch05.html#ch05fig1).

#### ***Defining Different Faces***

The `@font-face` syntax you’ve seen so far in this chapter is pretty straightforward, but it only defines one font face—that is, a single permutation of weight, slope, and so on. If you want to use a different face, such as a bolder weight or an italic type, you have to define each font face individually. To do this, you re-use the same name and add extra descriptors to the `@font-face` rule:

```
  @font-face {
➊     font-family: 'Gentium Basic';
      src: url('➋GenBasR.woff') format('woff');
  }
  @font-face {
➌     font-family: 'Gentium Basic';
➍     font-style: italic;
      src: url(' ➎GenBasI.woff') format('woff');
  }
  h1 { font-family: 'Gentium Basic', sans-serif; }
```

Here, you can see that the first `@font-face` rule defines the font name as `Gentium Basic` (➊) and gives the URL of the regular font face (➋). The second `@font-face` rule uses the same font name (➌) but adds the `font-style` property with the `italic` value (➍), and the URL points at the font’s italic face (➎). The italic style is applied automatically and appropriately, without your having to define it in the CSS, as in this example markup:

```
<h1>I knew him, Horatio</h1>
<h1><em>I knew him, Horatio</em></h1>
```

The second `h1` element uses the italic font face defined in the previous rules (you can see the result in [Figure 5-2](ch05.html#ch05fig2)).

![Image](graphics/f05-02.jpg)

*Figure 5-2: Gentium Basic Regular (top) and Italic (bottom) applied using* `*@font-face*`

You can define any number of variations of a font with this method by using different font properties in the `@font-face` rule: `font-weight` to set various weights, `font-variant` for small caps faces, and so on.

#### ***True vs. Artificial Font Faces***

One thing to be aware of when you use web fonts is that you must define a link to an appropriate file for each different font face you wish to use. If you don’t, browsers will attempt to re-create the face artificially, often with ugly results.

For example, if you’re going to use an italic style in your page, you must be sure to also define an italic style in `@font-face`. Here’s an illustration of how *not* to define an italic weight:

```
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Gentium Basic';
    src: url('GenBasR.woff') format('woff');
}
h1 {
    font-family: 'Gentium Basic', sans-serif;
    font-style: italic;
}
```

You can see that my `@font-face` rule uses the regular face of the Gentium Basic font, but the `h1` element has an italic style declared on it. You can see the effect in [Figure 5-3](ch05.html#ch05fig3), which compares this method with the correctly defined method from the previous section.

![Image](graphics/f05-03.jpg)

*Figure 5-3: Comparing an artificial italic (top) with a true italic font face (bottom)*

As you can see, the two examples are quite different. The first is the selected Gentium Basic font slanted to fake an italic style (using the first code example); the characters are larger, slightly distorted, and spaced inconsistently. The second is the true italic font face (using the correct method), which uses characters designed specifically for this purpose.

The same applies for all the different font faces: bold, italic, bold italic, small caps, condensed, and so on.

### **A “Bulletproof” @font-face Syntax**

I explained at the beginning of this chapter that the `@font-face` rule has been around for quite a while, having been implemented in Internet Explorer as far back as 1997\. This means that it carries with it some unfortunate legacy issues in older versions of IE. In addition, some historical issues around font formats can cause compatibility problems in older versions of other browsers.

Because of these issues, you need a workaround to ensure that `@font-face` works correctly across all browsers. Before I introduce the fully crossbrowser “bulletproof” `@font-face` syntax, let me discuss briefly some of the problems it addresses.

#### ***Using Local Fonts***

The `local()` value for the `src` property is used to check whether a user already has the defined font installed on his or her system—if the user does, the local copy can be applied rather than downloading a new copy. `local()` is a good idea, but it suffers from a few drawbacks. The first drawback, and not the least, is that `local()` isn’t supported by any versions of Internet Explorer below 9!

Another drawback is that, in some cases, the `@font-face` rule doesn’t play nicely with font management software, displaying incorrect characters or opening a dialog to ask for permissions to use a font.

For these reasons, leaving the `local()` value out is generally safer.

#### ***Font Formats***

The next problem comes in the shape of different, and competing, formats. When `@font-face` was originally implemented, it supported only Microsoft’s proprietary *Embedded OpenType (EOT)* format, and this is still the only font format that is supported in IE8 and below. To complicate this still further, IE9 causes the `@font-face` rule to break when the browser is put into compatibility mode; this is very much an edge case and becoming less relevant all the time, but it’s worth noting as we can fix it simply in our bulletproof syntax.

The resurgence of interest in web fonts came about because modern browsers—first Safari and then Firefox and then others—allowed the use of the more common *TrueType* and *OpenType* formats. Unfortunately, many commercial font foundries wouldn’t allow their fonts to be used in this way as it makes illegal copying of their fonts a little easier (see “[Licensing Fonts for Web Use](ch05.html#ch05leve1sec58)” on [page 53](ch05.html#page_53)). For this reason, Mozilla consulted with some font makers and created the *Web Open Font Format (WOFF)*, which is now supported in all major browsers, including IE9 and above, with the exception of older versions of the stock Android browser (4.3 and below).

Some browsers also accept the *Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)* font type. This font type is a vector re-creation of the font and is considerably lighter in file size, making it ideal for mobile use. This format is really only useful, however, if you need to support older versions (4.1 and below) of Safari for iPhone.

#### ***The Final “Bulletproof” Syntax***

For your chosen font to display the same in every browser on every platform, you should use code in this format:

```
  @font-face {
      font-family: 'Gentium Basic';
➊     src: url('GenBkBasR.eot');
➋     src: url('GenBasR.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),
➌     url('GenBkBasR.woff') format('woff'),
➍     url('GenBkBasR.ttf') format('truetype');
  }
```

Let me explain what’s happening here. The first font to be specified is the EOT (➊) for Internet Explorer 8 and below. This font is in a rule of its own, as the next rule contains the optional `format()` hint; this hint is unfamiliar to old IE8, and so the whole rule will be ignored. But the EOT font needs to be included again (➋) to deal with the IE9 compatibility problem. Next, the WOFF format is defined (➌) for the majority of browsers, followed by the TTF format (➍) for older browsers, including Android 4.3 and below (remember that browsers will ignore formats they don’t understand and therefore can’t load).

As the IE9 compatibility problem is really becoming less important, you can leave out the second line (➋) at your discretion.

For this to work, the major requirement is that your chosen font be available in three different formats. To make this easier, I strongly recommend using the `@font-face` Generator by Font Squirrel (*[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator/](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator/)*). Simply upload the font file you want to use and `@font-face` Generator converts it into all the relevant formats—as well as generating the CSS you need to use in your pages. This tool is invaluable. Font Squirrel also has a library of fonts that are ready to use with `@font-face` embedding, saving you the task of converting.

**NOTE**
*For a full explanation of why the IE trick is required and how it works, read* [http://www.fontspring.com/blog/the-new-bulletproof-font-face-syntax/](http://www.fontspring.com/blog/the-new-bulletproof-font-face-syntax/).

### **Licensing Fonts for Web Use**

As mentioned previously in “Font Formats” on [page 52](ch05.html#page_52), many font foundries expressly forbid embedding their web fonts in your pages using `@font-face`. They forbid this because linked OpenType or TrueType fonts are easy to locate and download and can then be used illegally in both on- and offline applications. The WOFF file type was created in response to this; WOFF is a web-only format and can contain licensing information to help track down a copyright infringer. Many foundries have already committed to selling this format, and I hope many more will follow.

In general, the best policy is to check that the font you choose has a license explicitly allowing you to use it for web embedding; don’t assume that because a font is free to download, it is free to use online. That said, many good-quality free fonts that do allow embedding are available online; some resources are given in Appendix B.

While the licensing situation is in a state of flux, many web font service providers have created mechanisms to embed fonts legally in your pages. By adding JavaScript to your pages, the provider is authorized to serve the font files from their network, so you can call the font families in your stacks. The method is known as *Fonts as a Service (FaaS)*.

Most FaaS providers are commercial, allowing a limited set of fonts for free but charging a monthly or annual fee for the majority. The two biggest players in this category are probably Fontdeck (*[http://fontdeck.com/](http://fontdeck.com/)*) and Typekit (*[https://typekit.com/](https://typekit.com/)*). Other providers supply only free fonts—Google Fonts (*[http://www.google.com/fonts/](http://www.google.com/fonts/)*) being a notable example of this. Each provider has its own way of including the licensed fonts on your site, usually through the inclusion of an external CSS or JS file, or both.

### **A Real-World Web Fonts Example**

Having discussed the intricacies and niceties of fonts, licensing, and multiple syntaxes, let’s see a real-world example of `@font-face` in action. I’ll use an example that compares text displayed in a standard sans-serif font (Arial) to the same text displayed in three different font families (all from Font Squirrel).

Here’s the CSS for this example. Bear in mind that, for the sake of clarity, I’ve simplified this snippet to show only a single font format (WOFF), although the accompanying example file has the full code:

```
@font-face {
    font-family: 'CartoonistHand';
    src: url('CartoonistHand.woff') format('woff');
}
@font-face {
    font-family: 'CartoonistHand';
    font-style: italic;
    src: url('CartoonistHand-Italic.woff') format('woff');
}
@font-face {
    font-family: 'CartoonistHand';
    font-weight: bold;
    src: url('CartoonistHand-Bold.woff') format('woff');
}
@font-face {
    font-family: 'ChunkFiveRegular';
    src: url('Chunkfive.woff') format('woff');
}
@font-face {
    font-family: 'AirstreamRegular';
    src: url('Airstream.woff') format('woff');
}
.font-face h1 { font-family: ChunkFiveRegular, sans-serif; }
.font-face h2 { font-family: AirstreamRegular, cursive; }
.font-face p { font-family: CartoonistHand, sans-serif; }
```

I also left out some color and size adjustments to keep the code as readable as possible. Here’s the markup I used:

```
<h1>Great Expectations</h1>
<h2>By Charles Dickens</h2>
<p>My father's family name being <em>Pirrip</em>, and my Christian name
<em>Philip</em>, my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or
more explicit than <strong>Pip</strong>. So, I called myself <strong>Pip
</strong>, and came to be called <strong>Pip</strong>.</p>
```

You can see the output in [Figure 5-4](ch05.html#ch05fig4).

![Image](graphics/f05-04.jpg)

*Figure 5-4: Text using “web-safe” fonts (left) and using different web fonts (right)*

In the example on the right, I mixed three fairly distinctive font families—many designers will probably tell you mixing isn’t a good idea on a production site, but it works well to illustrate my point. Whatever you think of my font choices, I hope you’ll at least agree that the text looks more dynamic and enticing with those choices applied.

Despite the long and winding route we’ve had to take to get a cross-browser syntax, using `@font-face` isn’t complicated; you’ll expend some overhead in the form of extra setup time to declare the font faces and variants you want to use, but after that you can call them in your font stacks and style them in exactly the same way as system fonts.

### **Controlling Font Loading**

Web fonts are loaded as external assets and must be downloaded by the browser before they can be displayed. Before the file has loaded, no font at all will be visible on the elements the font is to be applied to. You may then see a slight “flash” that occurs as the font loads and is applied. This is known as the *Flash of Unstyled Text (FoUT)*.

Many FaaS providers offer ways to work around this problem using configuration files, but if you’re hosting your own fonts, you may want to investigate the Web Font Loader library (*[https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader/](https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader/)*), which provides an event system that allows you to control the appearance of your page dynamically as fonts are loaded.

### **More Font Properties**

The CSS3 Web Fonts Module doesn’t just re-introduce the `@font-face` rule; it also revives two other font properties that were first proposed for CSS2\. These properties are potentially quite useful for giving you granular control over your fonts—I say *potentially* because, as of this moment, they aren’t widely implemented.

#### ***font-size-adjust***

The only drawback to using font stacks in CSS is that fonts can vary so much in size; your first choice font may look great at 16px, but if that font isn’t available, the next fallback may appear smaller or have different proportions and be harder to read at that size. To combat this, the `font-size-adjust` property lets you dynamically alter the `font-size` property to ensure a regular appearance no matter which font is used from the stack. The `font-size-adjust` property takes a single decimal value; here’s the syntax:

```
E { font-size-adjust: number; }
```

The `*number*` value is the proportion of the total height that is occupied by a lowercase *x* character (known as the *x-height*). In other words, a font might be 16px high in total, but the height of the lowercase *x* might be half that (8px), which gives an x-height ratio of 0.5 (8 divided by 16):

```
p { font-size-adjust: 0.5; }
```

By using `font-size-adjust`, you can ensure that no matter which font is displayed, the x-height always has the same value, and legibility does not suffer. To illustrate, consider the following code:

```
h1.adjusted { font-size-adjust: 0.517; }
h1.impact { font-family: Impact, serif; }
```

Then, in the following three `h1` elements, all with the same values for `font-size`, I apply different values to them using their class names, which you can see in this markup:

```
<h1>Of most excellent fancy</h1>
<h1 class="impact">Of most excellent fancy</h1>
<h1 class="adjusted impact">Of most excellent fancy</h1>
```

The first `h1` is rendered in the default Helvetica Neue font, the second in Impact, and the third also in Impact but with the `font-size-adjust` property applied using the value `0.517`, which is the x-height of Helvetica Neue. You can see the results in [Figure 5-5](ch05.html#ch05fig5).

![Image](graphics/f05-05.jpg)

*Figure 5-5: The effect of* `*font-size-adjust*` *on the Impact font (third line)*

You can clearly see the difference between the Helvetica Neue (first line) and Impact (second line) fonts in the first two `h1` elements. (Of course, you are unlikely to ever use these two in the same font stack, but because they have quite different x-heights, they’re good for illustrative purposes.) As I mentioned, Helvetica Neue has an x-height ratio of 0.517, which means the lowercase *x* is about half the height of the font. By contrast, Impact has an x-height ratio of 0.7, which means less contrast in height between upperand lowercase letters.

The first two lines in the example are not adjusted in any way, so Impact’s lowercase characters in the second line are considerably taller than Helvetica Neue’s in the first line—the fonts have the same size, but their metrics are different. In the third line, however, I set the `font-size-adjust` value to `0.517` to match the x-height ratio of Helvetica Neue:

```
h1.adjusted { font-size-adjust: 0.517; }
```

This adjusts the font size so Impact displays at a smaller size—just over 18.6px, which is slightly more than half of the 36px height set by `font-size`. You can see this more clearly if I directly compare the two elements, as shown in [Figure 5-6](ch05.html#ch05fig6). Here, the characters without *ascenders* (lines that rise above the x-height)—that is, *e*, *x*, *c*, and *n*—of the adjusted Impact font are the exact same height as those of the Helvetica Neue font.

![Image](graphics/f05-06.jpg)

*Figure 5-6: Characters from the Helvetica Neue font (left) compared to characters from the Impact font adjusted with* `*font-size-adjust*` *(right)*

Unfortunately, a font’s x-height ratio isn’t easily available; you can either use a graphics package to measure it manually or try to find an online resource. (I found a calculator made by the online fonts service, Fontdeck, which works with the fonts installed on your system: *[http://fontdeck.com/support/fontsizeadjust/](http://fontdeck.com/support/fontsizeadjust/)*.)

The major drawback of this property is that, at the time of writing, Firefox is the only browser that supports it.

#### ***font-stretch***

Some font families contain condensed or expanded variants, and the `font-stretch` property allows access to these. Here’s the syntax:

```
E { font-stretch: keyword; }
```

According to the specification, the keyword value can be any one of the following: `normal` (the default), `ultra-condensed`, `extra-condensed`, `condensed`, `semi-condensed`, `semi-expanded`, `expanded`, `extra-expanded`, and `ultra-expanded`. Each keyword relates to a font variant within a family, such as Frutiger Condensed or Nova Ultra Expanded.

In the following example, I use `font-stretch` to display two different faces of the font PT Sans, using the following code:

```
h1 { font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; }
h1.narrow { font-stretch: condensed; }
```

The `h1` element is displayed twice, both times using the font PT Sans. In the second instance, I’ve used the `font-stretch` property with the value `condensed`, which tells the browser to display the PT Sans Condensed face. You can see the results in [Figure 5-7](ch05.html#ch05fig7).

![Image](graphics/f05-07.jpg)

*Figure 5-7: The second example uses the narrow font face because of the effect of the* `*font-stretch*` *property.*

The `font-stretch` property is implemented in Firefox and IE9 and above, but you could also replicate the effect by using the `@font-face` rule (introduced at the beginning of this chapter) to specify a condensed or expanded face in your font stack:

```
@font-face {
    font-family: 'PT Sans Condensed';
    src: url('PT-Sans-Narrow.woff') format('woff');
}
```

### **OpenType Features**

Although web typography takes a great leap forward in CSS3, it still just scratches the surface of the possibilities of type. If you compare the options available to you in a browser with what’s available in a desktop publishing application such as Adobe InDesign, you’ll see that the latter is much richer than the former.

OpenType font formats are capable of much more than face or weight variations; they have a range of ligatures, swashes, special numeric characters, and much more. (If none of those terms makes any sense to you, I recommend Magnet Studio’s Beginners Guide to OpenType at *[http://www.magnetstudio.com/words/2010/opentype-guide/](http://www.magnetstudio.com/words/2010/opentype-guide/)*).

#### ***Enabling Font Features***

Many browsers have implemented a property that allows you to explore the extra features afforded by OpenType and other similar formats. The new property is called `font-feature-settings`, and here’s its syntax:

```
E { font-feature-settings: "parameters"; }
```

The `*parameters*` value is a series of strings containing shorthand codes for each font feature, plus an optional binary value to enable or disable the feature. Here’s an example:

```
E { font-feature-settings: "dlig" on; }
```

The first parameter is `dlig`, the short code for discretionary ligatures, plus the value of `on` to show it’s being enabled—the default state is on, so you can safely omit that value in this example.

If you want to disable a feature, you use the alternative binary value, `off`; in the following example, I’m disabling the small caps OpenType feature:

```
E { font-feature-settings: "smcp" off; }
```

You can, as I mentioned, have more than one parameter—just create a comma-separated list. The following example enables common ligatures and disables tabular numbers:

```
E { font-feature-settings: "liga", "tnum" off; }
```

Let’s look at some examples that show the advantage of using Open-Type features. In “[True vs. Artificial Font Faces](ch05.html#ch05leve1sec53)” on [page 50](ch05.html#page_50), I showed why you should always use a true italic font rather than letting the browser create one artificially. In this example, you’ll see that the same principle holds when using the small caps font variant. Here are the relevant style rules:

```
.smallcaps { font-variant: small-caps; }
.ot-smallcaps { font-feature-settings: "smcp"; }
```

Here, I use two `h1` elements: I apply the `font-variant` property with the `small-caps` value to the first; for the second, I use `font-feature-settings`, with the parameter used to toggle small caps, `smcp`. You can see the difference in [Figure 5-8](ch05.html#ch05fig8).

![Image](graphics/f05-08.jpg)

*Figure 5-8: The lower example uses OpenType’s own small caps feature*

In the first `h1` element, which uses simulated small caps, the proportions are off; the difference between the large and small capitals is barely noticeable. Compare that with the second `h1` element, which has more obvious proportions and looks more pleasing to the eye.

Now I’ll demonstrate the use of ligatures, which are used to join certain pairs of characters to make them appear more harmonious. As with kerning, most browsers automatically use common ligatures unless instructed not to, so, in this example, I’ll compare text with no ligatures, common ligatures, and discretionary—that is, more decorative—ligatures.

Here’s the code:

```
.lig-none { font-feature-settings: "liga" off; }
.lig-common { font-feature-settings: "liga"; }
.lig-disc { font-feature-settings: "dlig"; }
```

This code is applied to three `h1` elements. The first has the parameter string `"liga" off`, so common ligatures are disabled. The second uses the same parameter string except without the `off` value, so common ligatures are enabled. The third has the string `"dlig"`, which enables discretionary ligatures. [Figure 5-9](ch05.html#ch05fig9) compares the three.

*Figure 5-9: Comparing OpenType ligatures: (from top) none, common, and discretionary*

Pay attention to the character pairs *Th* and *ct*. In the first `h1` element, without ligatures, they are rendered as separate characters. In the second, with common ligatures, the *Th* pair is joined together at the point where the characters almost meet. In the third `h1` element, the ligatures are discretionary, so the *ct* pair is also joined with an extravagant flourish.

At the time of writing, `font-feature-settings` are implemented in IE10+ and in Chrome and Firefox with appropriate vendor prefixes. You can also get access to these properties in Safari, but in a slightly different way; read on to find out how.

**NOTE**
*These features are all suggestions to the browser, not commands; some browsers will choose how fonts are rendered considering the platform and potential performance, and these feature suggestions may be ignored.*

#### ***Font Feature Properties***

The individual features enabled or disabled by `font-feature-settings` are also specified to be implemented as individual properties, known as the `font-variant-*` properties. For example, to work with ligatures, you use the `font-variant-ligatures` property with a keyword value representing the ligatures you wanted to set; the following code disables discretionary ligatures:

```
E { font-variant-ligatures: no-discretionary-ligatures; }
```

You can also use `font-variant-position` for super- or subscript, `font-variant-caps` for titling capitalization, `font-variant-numeric` for numerical forms, and `font-variant-alternates` for swashes, ornaments, and so on.

Chrome and Safari are the only browsers to support the `font-variant-*` properties currently, with the `-webkit-` prefix, and the examples in [Figures 5-7](ch05.html#ch05fig7), [5-8](ch05.html#ch05fig8), and [5-9](ch05.html#ch05fig9) should all work in Safari using these properties instead of `font-feature-settings`.

One other related property is `font-kerning`, which (fairly obviously) controls the kerning of a font. This accepts values of `normal`, where kerning is applied; `none`, where kerning is disabled; and `auto` (the default), which lets the browser make the decision of whether to kern.

```
E { font-kerning: normal; }
```

In [Figure 5-10](ch05.html#ch05fig10), you can see this property in action. The upper heading has kerning disabled, whereas the lower has it applied. I’ve added some background lines to make it easier to see.

### **Summary**

While `font-size-adjust` and `font-stretch` will surely come in handy in the future, for now `@font-face` is the killer feature of the Web Fonts Module. `@font-face` is not without its drawbacks, however, not least that every extra font you use adds to the page’s load time. Also be aware that misuse or overuse of different typefaces can lead to decreased legibility. Your site lives or dies on its content, so make sure your visitors can read it by choosing your fonts carefully and checking them closely across different browsers.

Despite those caveats, you can use this simple rule to amazing effect. In [Chapter 6](ch06.html#ch06), I’ll show you some ways to further enhance your typography.

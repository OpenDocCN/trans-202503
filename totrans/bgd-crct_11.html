<p class="noindent">Congratulations, you’ve made it all the way to the end!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you’ve built all nine circuits, you should have a solid practical foundation for creating great things with electronics. If you’re new to electronics, you might not have understood all the details of each circuit in this book, but that’s okay. This book was all about building circuits and improving your practical electronics skills.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you want to understand more about how these circuits work and how you can build your own, check out my book <em>Electronics for Kids</em> (No Starch Press, 2016), which will teach you electronics from scratch, even if you’re not necessarily a “kid” anymore.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you want to step up your game and learn to build projects that can do much more advanced things, like use graphical displays, create melodies, and connect to the internet, I recommend exploring a popular device called Arduino (<em><a href="https://www.arduino.cc/">https://www.arduino.cc/</a></em>).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Whether you want to build an automatic cat door for your home or the next must-have gadget for the world, you’ll need to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to build those projects. That’s why I’m constantly creating new learning material to help people bring their own ideas to life with electronics. To help people from all backgrounds develop these abilities, I’ve created a learning portal for electronics called Ohmify. It’s a place where you can sign up for courses to learn a variety of skills, including:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Arduino programming</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Basic electronics</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Soldering</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Printed circuit board (PCB) design</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">And much more!</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can learn more about Ohmify at <em><a href="https://ohmify.com/">https://ohmify.com/</a></em>.</p>&#13;

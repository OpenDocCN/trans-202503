			</header>
			<p class="ChapterIntro"><a id="317"/>As you would expect with a vector editor, any text you add to an Inkscape drawing
remains fully editable <em>as text</em> at any time, no matter what styling, filters, or
transformations you apply to it. Creating and editing text objects is the domain of the
Text tool that allows you to type or delete words, wrap text into columns (manually or
automatically), apply style to text spans, adjust kerning and spacing, and so on.</p>
			<p>Inkscape does not compete with word processors or desktop publishing software; it is not very convenient for
handling large amounts of text. Inkscape has no structural formatting tools, such as automatic headings or style libraries.
Instead, as a visual design tool, Inkscape will give you complete and precise control over every glyph, word, and paragraph,
in most cases without sacrificing text editability.</p>
			<a id="section15.1"/><h2>15.1 Basic Editing</h2>
			<p>
				If you have an existing text object, select it and switch to the Text tool (F8 or T).
This places the text editing cursor (a blinking vertical line) at the end of the text
object. You can now click anywhere within the text to position the cursor, <a id="318"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_318" title="318"/>or you can move the cursor with the arrow keys. Or, in the Selector tool, just
double-click a text object—this will switch tools, select the object, and place
the cursor where you clicked, all at the same time.</p>
			<p>
				Clicking or double-clicking a text object is only possible when your mouse cursor has an "I" shape and a blue
frame appears around the text—these are the indications that you are over a clickable text object (<a href="#fig15-1">Figure 15-1</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig15-1"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="16/tx-cursor.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 15-1: Placing the text editing cursor by
clicking</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Typing and editing text works the same way in Inkscape as in a word processing application. Use Delete or Backspace to erase
characters (including newlines); press Enter to start a new line.
You can move the text cursor with the arrow keys (with Ctrl to jump by words), Home and End (with Ctrl
to move to the beginning or end of the text object), and Page Up and Page Down.
The canvas will automatically scroll, when necessary, so that the text cursor is always visible.</p>
			<p>
				If, for some reason, editing text on the canvas is inconvenient, open the<span class="ui"><strong>Text and Font</strong></span> dialog (<a href="#section15.3.2">15.3.2</a>) and, on the <span class="ui"><strong>Text</strong></span> tab, edit the selected
text object in a standard text area. Unfortunately, clicking <span class="ui">Apply</span> loses any formatting you may
have applied to spans within your text (<a href="#section15.3.1">15.3.1</a>), but if you just open the dialog to 
read the text or copy it to the clipboard without making any changes, it is perfectly safe.</p>
			<a id="section15.1.1"/><h3>15.1.1 Selecting</h3>
			<p>
				You can select inside a text object by dragging <em>over</em> some characters (as with
clicking, you must start with a character body, not empty space) or by moving the text
editing cursor with the Shift-arrow keys (<a href="#fig15-2">Figure 15-2</a>). This <em>text selection</em>, visible
as a greenish-blue rectangle overlay, is not to be confused with the program-wide <em>object
selection</em> (<a href="c05.xhtml#ch5">Chapter 5</a>); text selection is unique to the Text tool and allows you to
style, kern, or delete spans inside the selected text object. When editing text with the Text tool, 
pressing Ctrl-A  selects not all objects but
all text inside this text object.</p>
			<a id="fig15-2"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="16/tx-selection.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 15-2: Text selection with the Text tool</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Copying a text selection with Ctrl-C (or cutting with Ctrl-X) and
pasting at the cursor location with Ctrl-V is an easy way to move pieces of
text around—within the same text object, among text objects in the same
document, across <a id="319"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_319" title="319"/>documents, or even between Inkscape and other applications. For
example, you can copy a piece of text in a word processor and insert it into a text
object in Inkscape. Copy/paste in Inkscape never transfers formatting, only textual content.</p>
			<a id="section15.2"/><h2>15.2 Types of Text Objects</h2>
			<p>How do you create a new text object? This depends on the type of object you want to create.
Text objects in Inkscape can belong to different types that are broadly similar but differ in details of
their capabilities and behavior.</p>
			<a id="section15.2.1"/><h3>15.2.1 Regular Text</h3>
			<p>
				To create a <em>regular text object</em>, switch to the Text tool (F8), click the canvas (not
an existing text object!) to place a text cursor, and start typing. (If you drag
instead of click, you will create a text-in-a-shape object, <a href="#section15.2.2">15.2.2</a>.)
Press Enter to start a new line.</p>
			<p>
				Once you have typed at least one character, the new text object is added to the
document. At that point, you can switch to any other tool to deal with the newly created object
as you would with any other object—for example, transform it with the Selector tool (<a href="#fig15-3">Figure 15-3</a>),
paint it by clicking a palette color (this can be done in any tool), or draw a
gradient across it with the Gradient tool.</p>

					<h2>Regular Text in SVG</h2>
					<p>
						A regular text object is SVG's standard <code>text</code> element. Each
line in a multiline object is a <code>tspan</code> with a<code>sodipodi:role="line"</code> attribute and explicit <code>x</code> and<code>y</code> attributes that Inkscape calculates automatically, based on the
coordinates of the root text object and line spacing (<a href="#section15.4.5">15.4.5</a>).</p>

			<h4>15.2.1.1 Line Wrapping in Regular Text</h4>
			<p>In regular text objects, by default there's no automatic line wrapping; you need to press Enter to start
a new line. If you don't do that and just keep typing, there's no limit to the length of the line.</p>
			<p><a id="320"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_320" title="320"/>To enable automatic line wrapping in a regular text object, notice the diamond-shaped handle at the right end
of the text. (The smaller square mark on the left is the baseline origin mark, which is not draggable.)
As soon as the handle is moved away from its default position, the text displays two vertical guides that define the column
into which the text is flown (these guides are visible only in the Text tool). You can adjust the width by dragging the handle.
Any text line wider than the column is wrapped, as shown in <a href="#fig15-4">Figure 15-4</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig15-4"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="16/tx-reg-reflow.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 15-4: Wrapping long lines in a regular text object</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				In right-to-left text (<a href="#section15.4.1">15.4.1</a>), the baseline origin mark is on the right and the column width handle is on the left, and
you can adjust only the guide on the left of the column. With vertical text, the guides are horizontal; you can reflow text
by moving the bottom guide.</p>
			<p>
				Regular text can be aligned to the left, center, or right (<a href="#section15.4.2">15.4.2</a>), but full justification is not available
even when the text is autowrapped into a column. If you need a fully justified column of text, use text-in-a-shape (<a href="#section15.2.2">15.2.2</a>).</p>
			<p>If the column is narrower than the longest word of your text, Inkscape faces the tough choice of what to do with the words that don't fit.
Inkscape has no idea how to break words properly (if only because word-breaking rules depend
on language, and Inkscape does not know what language your text is in); one thing it does try is to break any hyphenated words at the
hyphen. Eventually, Inkscape gives up and  truncates the text—hiding everything starting from the first word that doesn't fit;
such a truncated text object displays red column guides instead of blue.
To fix a truncated text object, make the column wider, or reduce the font size, or edit the text so that all words fit.</p>

					<h2>Wrapped Text in SVG</h2>
					<p>
						If you have set a column width on regular text, its <code>text</code> element gets the <code>inline-width</code>
CSS property that specifies the width of the column. However, Inkscape (perhaps with good reason) does not rely on other SVG viewers to
interpret this attribute (which is new in the SVG 2.0 draft) correctly: it still creates automatic <code>tspan</code>s with explicit <code>x</code>
and <code>y</code> attributes (but without <code>sodipodi:role="line"</code>) for each line break.</p>

			<h3>15.2.2 Text-in-a-Shape</h3>
			<p>
				As you have seen, a regular text object may or may not have a specific column width,
depending on whether you have dragged the diamond handle. By contrast, a <em>text-in-a-shape</em>
always has its own intrinsic width and height—more generally, a <em>frame</em>—and it automatically wraps the text to fill its frame.
When typing in such a text object, pressing Enter starts a new paragraph.
A text-in-a-shape can be <em>truncated</em> if it is too long to fit completely
into the frame (compare <a href="#section15.2.1.1">15.2.1.1</a>).</p>
			<a id="section15.2.2.1"/><h4>
				15.2.2.1 <a id="321"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_321" title="321"/>Internal Frame</h4>
			<p>
				The easiest way to create a text-in-a-shape is by <em>dragging</em>, not clicking, over the
canvas using the Text tool. This creates a rectangular frame, much like dragging with
the Rectangle tool creates a rectangle (<a href="#fig15-5">Figure 15-5</a>). After releasing the mouse, you can type or paste
your text, which will wrap upon reaching the edge of the frame. You can also drag the
handle in the bottom-right corner to resize the frame and see the text automatically
reflow to the new size.</p>
			<a id="fig15-5"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="16/tx-flowed.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 15-5: Text-in-a-shape with an internal frame</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Text is wrapped at word boundaries; automatic hyphenation is not supported. If there's more
text than fits the frame, extra text (starting at a word boundary) will be truncated—hidden but
not lost; if you reduce font size, or delete some text, the end will move in and become visible.</p>
			<p>
				This kind of text object is said to have an <em>internal frame</em>: its rectangular frame
is part of the object itself, not a separate object. For example, when you transform the text,
it is transformed with its frame as a whole.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">

				</section>
			</aside>
			<a id="section15.2.2.2"/>
			<h4>15.2.2.2 External Frame</h4>
			<p>
				Instead of its own internal rectangular frame, a text object can be linked to any external path as its frame.
For this, select two objects—any text (regular or text-in-a-shape) and a path—and choose<span class="ui"><strong>Text<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Flow into Frame</strong></span>, as shown in <a href="#fig15-6">Figure 15-6</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig15-6"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="16/tx-flowed-external.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 15-6: A text object with an external frame</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				This command does not delete or hide the frame object; the text and the frame remain
separate, and the text is said to be <em>linked</em> to its frame, much like a
clone is linked to its original (<a href="c16.xhtml#ch16">Chapter 16</a>). Editing the shape of the frame object forces the
linked text to reflow to the changed shape, but styling the frame (for
example, hiding it by making fully transparent) does not affect the text.</p>
			<p><a id="322"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_322" title="322"/>You can move or transform the linked text separately from the frame, but
moving or transforming the frame affects the text as well (compare with the <span class="ui">Move according to
transform</span> clone compensation mode, <a href="c16.xhtml#section16.2">16.2</a>). Selecting a linked text object and
pressing Shift-D will select its frame, just as it does with a clone and its
original (<a href="c16.xhtml#section16.4">16.4</a>).</p>
			<p>
				To get rid of the frame, use the <span class="ui"><strong>Unflow</strong></span> command in
the <span class="ui"><strong>Text</strong></span> menu. This deletes the text-in-a-shape's internal frame (or breaks the link
to the external frame) and converts it into a regular text object. Each paragraph becomes a line.</p>

					<h2>Text-in-a-shape in SVG</h2>
					<p>
						Any text-in-a-shape (with either an internal or external frame) is represented in SVG
by a <code>text</code> element with the <code>shape-inside</code> CSS property that refers to the frame object.
Inside, Inkscape emulates wrapping with <code>tspan</code>s so that the text looks the same even
in browsers that don't support <code>shape-inside</code>
(which is new in SVG 2.0).</p>

			<h3>15.2.3 Flowed Text</h3>
			<p>
				If you open a file created in an old version of Inkscape, you may find another type of text object that looks and behaves
almost exactly like text-in-a-shape but is called <em>flowed text</em> in the status bar description. This type of object
(represented in SVG by a non-standard <code>svg:flowRoot</code> element and its children)
remained, for many years, the only way to create automatically wrapped text in Inkscape. This kind of flowed text
was never supported outside Inkscape, and while you can still view and edit flowed text objects in old Inkscape files,
it is a good idea to convert them to regular wrapped text objects by the <span class="ui">Text<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Convert to Text</span> command.</p>
			<a id="section15.2.4"/><h3>15.2.4 Text on a Path</h3>
			<p>
				Aside from using a path as a frame (<a href="#section15.2.2.2">15.2.2.2</a>), 
a single-line text object in Inkscape can link to a path to use it
as a guide to bend the text's baseline. Just select both the text and the path and
choose <span class="ui"><strong>Text<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Put on Path</strong></span>, as shown in <a href="#fig15-7">Figure 15-7</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig15-7"/><figure>

				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 15-7: Putting text on a path</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				This connection is live—both the text and the path remain editable, and
reshaping the path makes the text follow the new shape. If the text is longer than
the path, its end is hidden (but it is still there: if you delete some text at the
beginning, the end will move in and become visible). If the path consists of more than
one subpath (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.1.1">12.1.1</a>), the text will continue from one subpath to the
next at character boundaries (but not word boundaries).</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>
						Text on a path can only displace and rotate individual glyphs (letters)
but cannot deform them; if what you need is curvilinear deformation of letter shapes,
convert text to path (<a href="#section15.5">15.5</a>) and use one of the deformation
path effects (<a href="c13.xhtml#section13.3.3">13.3.3</a>).</p>

				</section>
			</aside>
			<p><a id="323"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_323" title="323"/>It makes no difference whether the path has any stroke or fill; the only thing that
matters for text is its geometric shape. Path direction also matters: if you
want to put text on the other side of the path and in the reverse
direction, choose <span class="ui"><strong>Path<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Reverse</strong></span> on the path, as <a href="#fig15-8">Figure 15-8</a> demonstrates.</p>

				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 15-8: Path direction affects

			<p>You can easily hide the guide path by making it fully transparent or by removing both
its fill and stroke. Transforming the path (for example, moving it around) affects its linked
text-on-a-path; however, you can scale, rotate, or move the text object away from its path and it will keep this separate transformation
without breaking the link.</p>
			<p>
				More than one text object can be linked to the same path. Use <span class="ui"><strong>Text<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Remove from
Path</strong></span> to convert text on a path into regular linear text, cutting its link to the
path.</p>

					<h2>Text on a Path in SVG</h2>

						Text on a path is a standard SVG feature. In SVG, it

			<h2>15.3 Styling Text</h2>
			<p>
				In many ways, text objects are no different from other object types: you
can transform and style (choose fill or stroke, adjust opacity, apply
filters) a text object as a whole without ever going into the Text tool (and, of
course, without losing the ability to edit the text). However, only the Text tool
allows you to change style properties specific to text (such as font family and
font size) as well as apply style to <em>spans</em> (fragments) inside a text object.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="box">
					<h2>Text Spans in SVG</h2>
					<p>
						To have a different style, a span of text must be enclosed in a<code>tspan</code> element. You don't need
to think about it: for any overlapping or nested spans that you create or delete,
Inkscape manages the <code>tspan</code> elements automatically.</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>
				The two places where you can change text styles are the controls bar of the Text tool
(above the canvas) and the <span class="ui">Text and Font</span> dialog (Shift-Ctrl-T). The former is faster and more
convenient, while the latter provides access to additional options.</p>
			<a id="section15.3.1"/><h3>
				15.3.1 <a id="324"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_324" title="324"/>Non-Text Style Properties</h3>
			<p>
				When you have a text span selected in the Text tool, most (but not all)
style-changing commands and style-reporting UI elements apply to that text span, not to
the entire text object. For example, you can easily change the color of a span of text
by selecting it and 
clicking a color swatch in the palette, using the <span class="ui">Fill and Stroke</span> dialog (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.2">8.2</a>)
or color gestures (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.7">8.7</a>), as shown in <a href="#fig15-9">Figure 15-9</a>. Similarly, you can assign or remove a stroke or adjust
opacity of the span. However, blur or other filters cannot be applied to a span; if you try this, the
entire text object will be blurred or filtered.</p>
			<p>Assigning a gradient or pattern fill to a span is possible, though it is tricky. You
need to create a separate object with the gradient or pattern you want, copy it
(Ctrl-C), then select a text span with the Text tool, and paste the style
(Shift-Ctrl-V) onto it. Unfortunately, you cannot then edit such a 
gradient on a span using handles in the Gradient tool.</p>
			<a id="fig15-9"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="16/tx-spans.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 15-9: Styling text spans</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>In general, the paste style trick is handy when styling text spans—it allows
you to transfer styles (including not only color but also font, size, letter
spacing, and so on) between objects and parts of your text. To copy a style from a text span,
you don't even need to select it; just place the text editing cursor anywhere
inside the span and press Ctrl-C.</p>
			<a id="section15.3.2"/><h3>15.3.2 Fonts and Variants</h3>
			<p>
				Inkscape allows you to use any outline fonts (TrueType, OpenType, Type 1) that
are installed in your operating system. You can also provide additional fonts, that
only Inkscape will be able to use, by placing them in the folder inkscape/fonts 
under the 
Inkscape data folder that you can look up in the <span class="ui">Preferences</span>, <span class="ui">System</span> page.
In addition, you can instruct Inkscape to look into other font folders by listing
them in the <span class="ui">Preferences</span>, <span class="ui">Tools<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Text</span> page under <span class="ui">Additional font directories</span>.</p>
			<p>
				A list of all font families (not individual fonts), with graphic samples for each
family, opens from the controls bar of the Text tool; you can choose a family by
scrolling through the list. If you know the name of the font you need, click to place
the cursor in the editing field (or press Alt-X) and start typing; a drop-down list of possible
completions will appear (<a href="#fig15-10">Figure 15-10</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig15-10"/><figure>

				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 15-10: Choosing a font family and style in the Text tool</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Most fonts contain variants (styles) within the same family; apart from italic/slanted and
weight variations (light, medium, bold, heavy, and so on), they may include variations along the
width axis (condensed or stretched). On <a id="325"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_325" title="325"/>the controls bar, the list of styles for the selected
family is to the right of the family drop-down. When editing, the Ctrl-I and Ctrl-B shortcuts
will try to toggle the selected text to the italic or slanted (with the same weight, if possible)
or to the bold style of the current font.</p>
			<p>
				The same lists of font families and styles are also available in the <span class="ui">Text and Font</span> dialog
(Shift-Ctrl-T, <a href="#fig15-11">Figure 15-11</a>). Here, instead of a small generic sample, you can see a
preview of the selected text object in the chosen font with the chosen font size. Once you choose the style you want in the dialog,

			<h4>15.3.2.1 Variable fonts</h4>
			<p>
				A <em>variable</em> font, instead of providing distinct styles as separate font files, has one or more <em>design axes</em> that allow you
to smoothly vary some font parameter—most commonly weight or width. This is a feature of OpenType fonts (OpenType is a successor to TrueType);
a number of freely available fonts, including those on Google Fonts (<a href="https://fonts.google.com/">https://fonts.google.com/</a>), make use of it.
Inkscape supports variable fonts in its <span class="ui">Text and Font</span> dialog: when a variable font is selected, its design axis (or axes) is shown as slider (or sliders)
above the font sample that reflects, live, the values of the variable parameters.</p>
			<a id="section15.3.3"/><h3>15.3.3 Font Size</h3>
			<p>
				In many cases, you don't even need to set font size numerically; you
can simply scale an entire text object with the Selector tool (<a href="c06.xhtml#section6.2">6.2</a>) or
keyboard shortcuts. Otherwise, use the font size controls on the controls bar (with a unit chooser)
or in the <span class="ui">Text and Font</span> dialog (which always uses px units). 
Both font size controls will then take this scaling into account
when displaying font sizes; for example, if you set a text object to 12 px font size but
then scale it up twice, you will see its font size reported as 24 px.</p>
			<a id="section15.4"/><h2>15.4 Text Layout</h2>
			<a id="section15.4.1"/><h3>15.4.1 Writing Mode and Orientation</h3>
			<p>Not all languages write left to right, top to bottom like English. Some languages are written right-to-left
(for example, Hebrew), and some prefer vertical placement of glyphs (for example, Japanese).</p>
			<p>
				Of the three drop-down switches that control language-specific text parameters (at the far right end of the Text tool's controls bar), the first one switches the text to vertical (top to bottom). For vertical text, it also controls the <em>block progression</em> (blocks in this context refer to paragraphs or lines within a paragraph) that can go right to left or left to right. This gives three options in this switch: horizontal text, vertical text with right-to-left block progression, and vertical text with left-to-right block progression.</p>
			<p>
				The second switch controls the orientation of individual glyphs inside vertical text. This makes a distinction between those characters that are normally always in horizontal text (such as those in western languages) and those that are usual in vertical text (such as Japanese characters). The three options—mixed, upright, and sideways—are illustrated in <a href="#fig15-12">Figure 15-12</a>.</p>
				<a id="fig15-12"/>
				<figure>
				<img alt="" src="16/tx-direction.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 15-12: Text direction, block progression, and glyph orientation options</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The last of the three buttons sets the inline writing direction of the text (left-to-right or right-to-left). Normally, right-to-left text (such as Hebrew)
works just <a id="327"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_327" title="327"/>as well without touching this option; it does not actually reverse the order of characters in your string but marks your text as right-to-left
as well as reverses alignment and changes the way cursor movement and selection keys work.</p>
			<a id="section15.4.2"/><h3>15.4.2 Alignment</h3>
			<p>
				Each text object has a certain alignment: <em>left</em> (default), <em>right</em>, or<em>center</em>, which you can choose with the drop-down on the Text tool's controls bar (<a href="#fig15-13">Figure 15-13</a>). For example, when
editing left-aligned text, pressing Enter moves the cursor horizontally to the<em>beginning</em> of the next line, and the text you type grows to the right of this
alignment edge, moving the cursor with it. In contrast, with right-aligned text,
Enter moves the cursor under the <em>end</em> of the previous line, and the text you
type shifts to the left while the cursor remains in place.</p>
			<a id="fig15-13"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="16/tx-align.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 15-13: Text alignment and justification</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				For text-in-a-shape, there's an additional alignment option: <em>justify</em>, which expands
the spaces in each line to make both edges of the text column line up.</p>
			<a id="section15.4.3"/><h3>
				15.4.3 <a id="328"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_328" title="328"/>Subscript and Superscript</h3>
			<p>
				To turn part of your text into superscript, select it and click the superscript button (<span class="ui"><strong>x<sup>y</sup></strong></span>)
on the controls bar. For example, type <code>1.496 × 1011</code>, then select the last two characters and turn them into 
a superscript to record the Earth to Sun distance in meters in scientific notation: <code>1.496 × 10<sup>11</sup></code>.
Another button produces subscript; if you want to have both subscript and superscript attached to the same character, as in<em>T</em><sup>2</sup><sub>2<em>n</em> + 1</sub>,
you will
likely need to apply some horizontal kerning (<a href="#section15.4.4">15.4.4</a>) to make it look good.</p>
			<a id="section15.4.4"/><h3>15.4.4 Kerning</h3>
			<p>When working with text, Inkscape gives you the freedom of moving each individual character and
adjusting the spacing between letters.</p>
			<p>
				Position your cursor before a character and press Alt-→.  The rest of
the line to the right of the cursor will move to the right by 1 screen pixel at the current
zoom; with Shift-Alt, the arrow keys move 10 times the distance of 
Alt (compare <a href="c06.xhtml#section6.5.1">6.5.1</a>). That's an interactive way to adjust the<em>kerning interval</em> between the two characters; you can also do it numerically via the <span class="ui">Horizontal kerning</span>
value in the controls bar (which works in px units).</p>
			<p>
				You can kern any pair of characters closer together or further apart to achieve the best overall
balance and visual rhythm in a line of text. You can also kern spaces to move<em>words</em> closer together or farther apart as needed. 
To visualize the kerning you have added, simply select the text (Ctrl-A).
Whenever two letters were manually kerned closer together, their selection
rectangles will overlap, and you will see a darker band; contrastingly, a kerned-out pair
of characters will have a gap in the selection overlay between them (<a href="#fig15-14">Figure 15-14</a>). The width of the
darker band or gap corresponds exactly to the amount of kerning you have added at that
point.</p>
			<a id="fig15-14"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="16/tx-kern.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 15-14: Adjusting kerning intervals in a string</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>By zooming in closer, you can make finer kerning adjustments. Don't get carried away,
however; always zoom out to see how your interval looks in the context of the entire
text line.</p>
			<p><a id="329"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_329" title="329"/>Horizontal kerning is especially useful for text on a path. As you can see in <a href="#fig15-7">Figure 15-7</a>, letters tend to be too close together in concave bends and too far apart on
convex arcs. With manual kerning, it is easy to counteract this effect and make the
characters spread evenly along the curve.</p>
			<p>
				Many fonts contain built-in kerning instructions; for example, a font may specify
that whenever <em>Y</em> and <em>a</em> are next to each other, they are kerned together by 0.03 of the
font size. Inkscape honors these automatic font kerning instructions. However, if you
try to adjust kerning in such a pair of characters manually, you will disable the
automatic kern. This is why the first Alt-← to kern <em>Y</em> and <em>a</em> closer
together may result in these two letters jumping, unexpectedly, further apart. Don't
worry; just keep pressing Alt-← to achieve the interval you
need.</p>
			<p>
				You can also kern characters <em>vertically</em> by pressing Alt-↑ and
Alt-↓ or via another controls bar widget. A combination of horizontal and vertical kerning gives you an
absolute freedom in positioning individual letters in a text string, as <a href="#fig15-15">Figure 15-15</a> demonstrates.</p>
			<a id="fig15-15"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="16/tx-kern-v.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 15-15: Combining horizontal and vertical
kerning</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				If you select one or more characters (with a mouse drag or by pressing Shift-arrows),
kerning shortcuts  will effectively move the selected fragment
relative to the rest of the text by inserting two opposite kerns
before and after it, as shown in <a href="#fig15-16">Figure 15-16</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig15-16"/><figure>

				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 15-16: Moving a selection via kerning
shortcuts</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Finally, you can <em>rotate</em> any character in a text object by pressing Alt-[
or Alt-] when the cursor is before that character (<a href="#fig15-17">Figure 15-17</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig15-17"/><figure>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="330"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_330" title="330"/>This rotation is
around the character's <em>baseline origin</em>—its leftmost point on the <em>baseline</em> (the
line on which lie the bottoms of most letters without extenders, such as <em>i</em> or <em>m</em>).
The baseline origin of the first character in a selected text object is shown on the
canvas as a little square in the Selector and Text tools.</p>

			<h3>15.4.5 Letter, Word, and Line Spacing</h3>
			<p>
				What if you want to kern all characters in your text—not just some
particular pair—closer together or farther apart? This kind of adjustment is called <em>letter spacing</em> (in other software,
it may be called <em>tracking</em>). Select all or
part of the text and press Alt-&gt; to space the characters apart or
Alt-&lt; to move them closer together (these are the same shortcuts that
scale an object in the Selector tool), or modify the <span class="ui"><strong>Spacing between letters</strong></span> value in
the Text tool's controls bar (<a href="#fig15-18">Figure 15-18</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig15-18"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="16/tx-letterspacing.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 15-18: Spacing letters further apart (top) or squeezing
them together (bottom)</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The ideal amount of letter spacing depends on the final viewing size of your
text. Usually, a smaller font size requires more airy spacing, while larger text should be
tighter.</p>
			<p>
				Similarly, you can adjust the spacing between words—that is, change the default width
of the space character. For example, if you put 10 in the <span class="ui">Spacing between words</span> field on the controls bar,
each space in the selected text will be 10 px wider than the default.</p>
			<p>
				To adjust the spacing between
lines in a text object,
press Ctrl-Alt-&gt; or Ctrl-Alt-&lt;.
On the controls bar, the corresponding <span class="ui">Spacing between baselines</span> value
can be expressed in relative units (<span class="ui">lines</span> or <span class="ui">%</span>, which refer to the size of the font)
or in absolute units such as inches (<a href="#fig15-19">Figure 15-19</a>). For example, text in a 20 px font with line spacing set to 1.2 lines will have 24 px
between adjacent baselines. Changing line spacing affects the entire text object, regardless of whether any text is selected.</p>

			<h3>
				15.4.6 <a id="331"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_331" title="331"/>Ligatures</h3>
			<p>
				Some fonts have, in addition to single characters, <em>ligatures</em>—combined glyphs for
pairs (or triples, or more) of certain characters. By default, Inkscape uses the ligatures defined in the font.
For example, the Alef font has a ligature for the characters "fi," as <a href="#fig15-20">Figure 15-20</a> demonstrates.</p>
			<a id="fig15-20"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="16/tx-ligature.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 15-20: Ligatures in Inkscape</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Having a single glyph for two or more characters, however, makes Inkscape behave weirdly
when you move cursor with the arrow keys: you still need two keystrokes to pass the "fi" ligature (because
it's two characters), but the visible cursor doesn't move on one of these keystrokes because Inkscape
can't place the cursor inside a ligature. You need to imagine a "virtual" cursor between "f" and "i" when you start
before the "fi" and press → once but the visible cursor doesn't move.</p>
			<p>This suggests a way to get rid of a ligature you don't want. When the "virtual" cursor is inside the ligature,
press Alt-← or Alt-→ once. Inkscape inserts a kern, which breaks the ligature.</p>
			<p>
				To look up which types of ligatures a font supports, open the <span class="ui"><strong>Text and Font</strong></span> dialog (Shift-Ctrl-T).
On the <span class="ui">Features</span> tab for the selected font, you will see check marks against some of the ligature classes: <span class="ui">Common</span> (this includes
the "fi," "fl," and some others), <span class="ui">Discretionary</span> ("sp," "st," "rt," and others in certain decorative fonts), <span class="ui">Historical</span> (mostly those with an
old-style "long s"), and <span class="ui">Contextual</span> (those that are supposed to be used only in certain contexts but not others).</p>
			<a id="section15.4.7"/><h3>15.4.7 Special Characters</h3>
			<p>
				From time to time, you may need to enter a character that your keyboard doesn't have a key for.
In the <span class="ui">Unicode Characters</span> dialog (from the <span class="ui">Text</span> menu), you can look up and insert any Unicode character
in any of the fonts available to Inkscape.</p>
			<p><em>Unicode</em> is a worldwide standard that covers all existing and most historical
alphabets, as well as a plethora of other special characters. The wealth of Unicode <a id="332"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_332" title="332"/>characters can be divided
by <em>script</em> (for example, Common, Cyrillic, or Katakana) and, more narrowly, by <em>range</em> (for example, General Punctuation,
Cyrillic Supplement, or Katakana Phonetic Extensions). The best place to look up the details of the extremely complex
Unicode standard is <a href="https://unicode.org/">https://unicode.org/</a>.</p>
			<p>
				If you leave the <span class="ui">Script</span> and <span class="ui">Range</span> choosers in the <span class="ui">Unicode Characters</span> dialog set to <span class="ui">all</span>,
the dialog will show you all the characters that exist in the selected font (<a href="#fig15-21">Figure 15-21</a>). Double-click the character you need to place it into
the editing field in the bottom left, and then click <span class="ui"><strong>Append</strong></span> to add it to the current text object.</p>

Just press Ctrl-U while editing a text object, type the number (watch the status bar for feedback), and
press Enter. The character will be inserted at the text cursor.</p>

				15.5 <a id="333"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_333" title="333"/>Converting Text to Path</h2>
			<p>
				For all of Inkscape's text-editing capabilities, sometimes you will want
to convert text to path—for example, to edit the shapes of individual letters, to
clip something with your text (that requires a path), or to send your SVG
document to someone who may not have the font you're using. The command<span class="ui">Path<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Object to Path</span> (Shift-Ctrl-C) will work on text objects
just as it does on shapes (<a href="c13.xhtml#section13.1">13.1</a>).</p>
			<p>
				Unlike a shape, however, a text object becomes not a single path but a <em>group</em> of paths,
one for each glyph (character) of the original text. This allows Inkscape to fully
preserve the appearance of the text, including any styling applied to spans inside
it. Now you can select any individual letter with Ctrl-click in the Selector or with a simple click in
the Node tool. If you really need a single path for the entire text object, choose <span class="ui"><strong>Path<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Object to Path</strong></span> as above, then use <span class="ui"><strong>Path<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Combine</strong></span> (Ctrl-K) to combine all of the characters
into a single path object with a uniform style.</p>
			<a id="section15.6"/><h2>15.6 Spellcheck</h2>
			<p>
				Inkscape's built-in spellchecker can use up to three dictionaries at the same
time. To set it up, go to the <span class="ui"><strong>Spellcheck</strong></span> page of the <span class="ui"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> dialog (<a href="#fig15-22">Figure 15-22</a>).</p>

				For
example, you can use French as your primary language but add English and Russian as
second and third languages. This way, you can check spelling in any of those languages or
a mix of them, and only the words that are missing in all three languages will be flagged
as misspelled. If you need only a single language, leave the second and third options set to<span class="ui"><strong>None</strong></span>.</p>

					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>On Linux, you need to install Aspell dictionaries for the languages you want to

					<div class="bottom hr">

			<p>Many languages have more than one dictionary. For example, English (en) has

a misspelled word is found, Inkscape displays a red frame around the word and lists
the suggestions in the dialog, as shown in <a href="#fig15-23">Figure 15-23</a>.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Choose one of the listed suggestions and<span class="ui">Accept</span> it.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Ignore once</span>: the next time this word is encountered, the

				<li><span class="ui">Add</span> the word to one of the active dictionaries so that it is never flagged
as misspelled again in this or subsequent sessions.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Also, since the dialog does not lock the Inkscape window, you can simply edit the word
with the Text tool, as you would normally do. Once you edit it to something acceptable, 
the spellchecker will automatically turn off the red frame and continue checking the
document.</p>
			<p>
				You can stop the spellcheck at any time by clicking <span class="ui"><strong>Stop</strong></span> (or simply closing the <span class="ui"><strong>Check Spelling</strong></span> dialog). Restart a stopped check by clicking <span class="ui"><strong>Start</strong></span> again.</p>

			<h2>15.8 Creating Fonts</h2>
			<p>Creating new fonts is not for a casual user. The sheer amount of terminology you would need to master is daunting. And yet
it may be tempting to have an original font of your own creation that you can use anywhere. The best part is that you
can do it (mostly) in Inkscape, too!</p>
			<p>
				Inkscape's font editing functionality is based on SVG 1.1, which included provisions for storing custom
fonts right in an SVG document that can use them for text.
Unfortunately, this part of the standard was removed in SVG 2.0 because it had failed
to achieve widespread support in browsers. Still, Inkscape supports creating SVG 1.1 files with embedded SVG fonts, and then
you can use the open source font editor called FontForge (<a href="https://fontforge.org/">https://fontforge.org/</a>) to convert such an SVG file to a
standard font format such as OpenType. You probably won't want to use this route for serious marketable fonts with advanced
features, but for something simple, such as a letters-only font imitating your handwriting, it is perfectly workable.</p>
			<p>I will not describe this functionality in detail because the whole story of font creation could easily fill a book. Instead, below is a
high-level overview of the process that should get you started.</p>
			<p>
				You can begin with any empty document, but there's a convenient <span class="ui">Typography Canvas</span> template (<span class="ui">File<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>New from Template</span>)
that provides a 1024 by 1024 px square with
horizontal guides at the levels that define a Latin-alphabet letter: the baseline, the ascenders and descenders of the lowercase
characters, and the height of the capitals.
Create each of your letter shapes in a layer of its own; each letter must be a single path.</p>
			<p>
				Then, open the <span class="ui"><strong>Text<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>SVG Font Editor</strong></span> dialog. Create a new font by clicking the <span class="ui"><strong>New</strong></span> button. Then, go to the <span class="ui"><strong>Glyphs</strong></span> tab and start
adding glyphs by clicking <span class="ui"><strong>Add Glyph</strong></span>; the <span class="ui">Glyph name</span> can be descriptive (for example, "lowercase a"), but the <span class="ui">Matching string</span>
must contain the exact character for which this glyph will be used (that is, just "a" for a lowercase <em>a</em>). In the <span class="ui"><strong>Advance</strong></span> column, enter the distance
this character takes in the string (that is, its width plus some default spacing).</p>
			<p>
				Finally, you need to copy the letter shape path you have made to the font's glyph (<a href="#fig15-24">Figure 15-24</a>).
Make sure you have the path selected on the canvas and the corresponding glyph selected in the list and click the <span class="ui"><strong>Get curves from selection</strong></span> button.
Later, if you edit the shape of a glyph in its layer, you will need to do this copying again to update the font.
To preview how your glyphs look together in a string, type something into <span class="ui"><strong>Preview Text</strong></span> and see the result in the preview <a id="336"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_336" title="336"/>pane.
You can also specify automatic kerns for specific pairs of glyphs by going to the <span class="ui">Kerning</span> tab of the dialog.</p>

				When your glyphs are ready, save the SVG file and open it in FontForge to check. If it looks good, save it in OpenType format with <span class="ui"><strong>File<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Generate fonts</strong></span>
in FontForge.
You then can install the resulting .otf file into your operating system for use by any program.
If you need to change some parameters of the font, you can probably do that in FontForge; if you want to edit the glyphs in Inkscape, however, you would need to go
back to the original SVG file, edit the paths in their layers, and make sure to copy each changed glyph path into the font (<span class="ui">Get curves from selection</span>).</p>

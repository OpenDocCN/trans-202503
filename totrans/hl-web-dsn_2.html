<h2 class="h2b"><strong>THEORY AND DESIGN PRINCIPLES</strong></h2>
<p class="noindentt1"><span class="small">LET’S DIVE INTO THIS INFORMATION IN MORE DEPTH</span>, shall we?</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Each section in this chapter is going to balance theory (so you understand the background and the why of things), real-life examples (so you can see these principles being applied), and shortcuts (so you can apply some of these principles quickly without starting from scratch).</p>
<p class="noindentt1">I’ll give you a few rules and suggestions to remember. Of course, there are exceptions to every rule, and every rule can be broken. Because these sections are aimed at beginners, we’ll be sticking to these principles, but as you grow as a designer you’ll learn when you can break some of the rules.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">As we go through each section in depth, we’ll apply these principles to the little widget (shown in <strong><a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig1">FIGURE 2-1</a></strong>).</p>

<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-1:</strong> A (rather ugly) widget. Let’s improve how it looks, shall we?</p>
<p class="noindentt1">It’s not much to look at right now, but it will gradually look better as we apply what we learn.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Let’s get started!</p>
<p class="sec" id="ch00lev1sec11"><a id="page_9"/>SECTION 2.1</p>
<p class="sec1" id="ch00lev1sec12">GRID</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><span class="small">OUR FIRST PRINCIPLE IS AN EASY ONE:</span> line things up!</p>
<p class="noindentt1">You may have heard this common designer complaint:</p>
<p class="noindentt1">A designer builds a pixel-perfect mock-up and passes it along to the developer to build. The developer builds the design, but the built design differs from the mock-up by something arbitrary like two pixels!</p>
<p class="noindentt1">“Silly designer,” says the developer. “Why does something so small matter? It’s basically the same.”</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Here’s the thing — small pixel differences really do matter, especially when it comes to elements on a page. If one element is close to but not completely lined up with another element, it can create a tiny bit of unevenness, and that little bit of chaos leads to a feeling of unease and clutter (<strong><a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig2">FIGURE 2-2</a></strong>).</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig2"><a id="page_10"/><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig02.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-2:</strong> The two screenshots are basically the same, but the one on the left, where everything is slightly out of line, looks less cohesive and professional.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">The easiest way to make sure that elements line up with one another is to add a grid to our design. A grid adds an invisible skeleton to our app, a scaffolding that we can use to set up and arrange our elements so the overall layout looks tidy and ordered. Aligning elements to an underlying grid will help you achieve alignment and consistency throughout your design.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">The <em>New York Times</em> website <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig3">FIGURE 2-3</a>)</strong> uses five main <em>columns</em> to organize a large amount of information. The spaces between the columns highlighted in red are <em>gutters.</em> Objects in your grid can span multiple columns, and some objects might break out of the grid, but everything more or less adheres to the grid.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">You can use any number of columns in your design <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig4">FIGURE 2-4</a>)</strong>, but a 12-column grid <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig5">FIGURE 2-5</a>)</strong> is the most often used for versatility.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">A grid also helps you create a plan for your website’s layout because it constrains you to place elements within certain areas rather than having the entire page to choose from. Win win win.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">In essence: Got a bunch of elements? Line them up (horizontally, vertically, or both) to create a feeling of cohesiveness.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec13"><a id="page_12"/><strong>Shortcuts</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">The theory here is simple — just line things up — but there are many tools that make it easy to ensure we’re using the grid.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec14"><em>Grids in mock-up programs</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">If you’re working on something that you won’t be building in <span class="small">CSS</span>, you’ll need to add guides to your design.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">All mock-up programs — Photoshop, Sketch, or <span class="small">GIMP</span> — allow you to set guides to float over your design, which makes it easy to align elements to the guide.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">If you’re working on a website mock-up in something like Photoshop, you can use grid templates to lay out your website using the same columns you’d use in your website framework system (<strong><a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig6">FIGURE 2-6</a></strong>).</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig6"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig06.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-6:</strong> Guides can be set by dragging from the rulers at the left and top of the screen in Photoshop.</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><a id="page_13"/>Guides are also accessible in most slide programs and other simple layouts, such as Keynote <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig7">FIGURE 2-7</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig7"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig07.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-7:</strong> Keynote also lets you pull out guides from the rulers on the screens. Many other programs have similar options.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">For slides, you don’t need to add a whole 12-column grid to your system — the slides in <strong><a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig7">FIGURE 2-7</a></strong> have only a few guides, just enough to keep elements on separate pages along the same lines.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">However, if you’re designing something a bit more complex, you can download quite a few templates with multiple columns already set up, such as the 960.gs (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/4">hellobks.com/hwd/4</a></em>) system.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec15"><em>Grids for web design</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">I highly recommend using a <span class="small">CSS</span> framework with a grid included, such as Bootstrap (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/5">hellobks.com/hwd/5</a></em>), Foundation (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/6">hellobks.com/hwd/6</a></em>), Skeleton (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/7">hellobks.com/hwd/7</a></em>), mini.css (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/8">hellobks.com/hwd/8</a></em>), or PureCSS (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/9">hellobks.com/hwd/9</a></em>) <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig8">FIGURE 2-8</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig8"><a id="page_14"/><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig08.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-8:</strong> The grid system included in the Bootstrap CSS framework.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">By using the <span class="small">HTML</span> classes that constrain your design to the underlying <span class="small">CSS</span> Grid, your elements will naturally align with other elements on the page <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig9">FIGURE 2-9</a>)</strong>. Just keep in mind that additional margins or padding that might be added in <span class="small">CSS</span> may bump elements out of alignment.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig9"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig09.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-9:</strong> Some of the CSS classes included in Bootstrap to align and set your objects in the underlying grid.</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><span class="small">CSS</span> is getting a new element called CSS Grid (how convenient!) that makes it super simple to align elements to a grid without using a <span class="small">CSS</span> framework. At the time of this book’s writing, CSS Grid is on the verge of being released and covered by most browsers. While this book doesn’t cover <span class="small">CSS</span>, using CSS Grid will make it easier to implement grid-based designs <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig10">FIGURE 2-10</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig10"><a id="page_15"/><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig10.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-10:</strong> CSS Grid docs on the Mozilla Developer Network (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/10">hellobks.com/hwd/10</a></em>)</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec16"><strong>Real-life examples</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">Remember the little widget we introduced at the beginning of this chapter? Let’s update the design by lining up the elements <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig11">FIGURE 2-11</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig11"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig11.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-11:</strong> On the left, the original widget. On the right, we’ve lined up the edges of the elements in the box, making it feel a bit cleaner and less chaotic.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">While the widget still has issues (after all, we’re just getting started), you can see that this little change has made a small but significant positive difference. All of the interior elements are now lined up: headline, content, input, button. The input’s placeholder text is bumped out a bit because of the padding <a id="page_16"/>in the form, but its containing element aligns to the grid. The overall feeling is just a bit more cohesive, a little less chaotic.</p>
<p class="line"> </p>
<p class="noindentt1">Again, in a nutshell: just line things up. Add guides to align your elements to an invisible grid, and pay attention to the little pixel differences and misalignments that can make a design feel more chaotic. Feel free to break the rules occasionally and go off the grid (<em>ha</em>), but using a grid for most of your elements will create a cleaner, more organized design.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Next up, we’re going to talk color!</p>
<p class="sec" id="ch00lev1sec17"><a id="page_17"/>SECTION 2.2</p>
<p class="sec1" id="ch00lev1sec18">COLOR</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><span class="small">COLOR IS SO IMPORTANT TO DESIGN</span>, but it’s a topic that can be overwhelming. With all of the rainbow at our fingertips, how do we choose the right colors? There’s a reason why color theory is a semester-long course for design students.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">In my own color theory course, I had to create a perfect gradient in 20 swatches from black to white in paint. The best way to accomplish that was to paint 200+ swatches: taking black paint, add a drop of white, paint a swatch . . . add another drop of white paint, paint another swatch . . . and then narrow down those hundreds of swatches into 20 perfect, even steps from white to black.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Don’t worry, I’m not going to put you through that. Look how much time and effort you’re saving by reading this book!</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Color theory courses cover a lot of terms that we’re going to skip here — <span class="small">CMYK</span> vs. <span class="small">RGB</span> colors, color harmony theory and color wheels, triadic and analogous colors — it can get really overwhelming really fast. I’m going to cover a very broad overview of color theory aimed at getting you more comfortable as fast as possible; at the end of the chapter I’ll give you resources that you can use to learn more about everything we cover.</p>

<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f0019-04.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>IVORY:</strong> quiet, calm, elegant</p>
<p class="noindentt1">First up is color psychology, a color “hack” that you can use to invoke various feelings in your work. Color can affect how your design is felt and perceived. In a very general sense, these are the emotions evoked by certain colors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Red:</strong> aggression, importance, passion</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Orange:</strong> energy, playfulness, affordability</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Yellow:</strong> friendliness, happiness, attention</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Green:</strong> growth, nature, success</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Blue:</strong> trust, comfort, relaxation</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Purple:</strong> luxury, romance, mystery</p></li>
<li><a id="page_20"/><p class="noindent5"><strong>Pink:</strong> playfulness, innocence, youth</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Brown:</strong> stability, rusticity, earthiness</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Black:</strong> power, sophistication, edginess</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>White:</strong> virtue, sterility, health</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Gray:</strong> formality, neutrality, professionalism</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Ivory:</strong> quiet, calm, elegance</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindentt1">When you want your design to evoke a feeling of success and stability, green and blue are great colors to use. A website for a sleek modern hotel might use black and purple. In general, warmer colors (reds, yellows) are more energetic and exciting, whereas cooler colors (blues, purples) are more stable and calming.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">It’s worth noting that these are Western associations — if you’re designing for another culture, it would be worth researching any color connotations that specific culture may have. For example, white is a mourning color in China, compared to black in Western cultures.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">You can also play with vibrancy. Less vibrant hues, like those on the “Keep Portland Weird” page on the Keep Earthquakes Weird website by Oblio, are calmer and more subtle than bright and vibrant hues, like those used on the Citysets website. In color psychology, blues are relaxing, but the bright, eye-popping blue feels more energetic <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig12">FIGURE 2-12</a>)</strong>.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">These are not hard-and-fast rules. You can certainly create a calm and elegant website using red — however, these color psychology shortcuts give you a jumping off point so you’re not overwhelmed with color options at the start.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig12"><a id="page_21"/><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig12.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-12:</strong> Less vibrant hues are calmer and less energetic than bright, eye-popping versions.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec19"><strong>Shortcuts</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">Now that we know some fundamentals, let’s check out a few shortcuts we can use to save ourselves time.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec20"><em>Limit your color scheme</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">Avoid picking colors at random for your design. Choosing two to four colors for your site and limiting all of your elements to the colors on your palette will help your site feel less busy <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig13">FIGURE 2-13</a>)</strong>.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec21"><em>Use color to make your design “pop”</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">When building a color palette, avoid the temptation to go for all bright colors. Using mostly grayer or more neutral colors with one “pop” color makes it easier to highlight important elements without creating a chaotic design <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig14">FIGURE 2-14</a>)</strong>.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec22"><em>Pay attention to contrast</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">Light gray text on a white background looks pretty but is a nightmare to read, especially for readers who may have a visual impairment <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig15">FIGURE 2-15</a>)</strong>. Colored text on a colored background can also get you in trouble if there isn’t enough contrast. When in doubt, use a color contrast checker such as WebAIM (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/25">hellobks.com/hwd/25</a></em>) to make sure your text is readable.</p>

<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-15:</strong> Light gray text on a white background has low contrast and can be hard to read.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec23"><em>Use a color palette website</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">Building a color palette from scratch can take a long time and a lot of thought. Thankfully, a ton of websites are dedicated to helping you choose a color palette to use in your designs.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Adobe Color CC (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/28">hellobks.com/hwd/28</a></em>) builds a palette of colors around your choice of a base color and various color schemes — I recommend “complementary” <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig16">FIGURE 2-16</a>).</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt1">The Material Design Palette website (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/29">hellobks.com/hwd/29</a></em>) automatically displays colors in a sample design, which is super helpful when you’re struggling to visualize how two colors could work together <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig17">FIGURE 2-17</a>).</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt1">A new option is Colormind (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/30">hellobks.com/hwd/30</a></em>), which uses deep learning to generate color palettes. You can loop through palettes as well as generate palettes after setting one or more specific colors <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig18">FIGURE 2-18</a>).</strong></p>

<p class="noindentt1">Keep in mind that you can alter the colors in a preset palette slightly if you wish — they aren’t set in stone. I often find that I need to lighten or darken a shade in order to get good contrast in my design.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec24"><strong>Real-life examples</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">Don’t get too married to a particular color palette — once you implement the colors into your design, you might find that your original favorite doesn’t work as well as you had hoped. I usually go through at least a few palettes until I find one that feels best.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Let’s run our little widget through some different color palette options <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig19">FIGURE 2-19</a>)</strong>.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">That last option gives our text good contrast, a nice color “pop” color for our button, and a soothing green background — looking pretty good, and certainly better than the original version with no color at all!</p>

<p class="noindentt1">Next up, another big subject — typography and text!</p>
<p class="sec" id="ch00lev1sec25"><a id="page_28"/>SECTION 2.3</p>
<p class="sec1" id="ch00lev1sec26">TYPOGRAPHY</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><span class="small">IF YOUR DESIGN INCLUDES ANY KIND OF TEXT</span>, you’re dealing with typography. According to Wikipedia, “Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed.” Simply put, make your words easy and enjoyable to read.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Type can be beautiful but hard to read (websites with trendy thin, pale gray fonts) but also easy to read and less pleasing to look at (pretty much any website using default system fonts). Succeeding in both areas can seem complicated, but there are a lot of great shortcuts that make it easier.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">We could spend another whole university semester covering typography theory in full, the history of typefaces, and more. Instead, I’m going to pack a lot of this information into one quick section.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">You might be wondering about the difference between a <em>font</em> and a <em>typeface.</em> To be completely correct, a typeface is a “family,” or collection of fonts. <em>Arial</em> is a typeface, and <em>Arial Bold</em> is a font. That said, the two terms are frequently used interchangeably (unless you’re a typographer), and we’ll be doing so here.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec27"><a id="page_29"/><strong>Typography fundamentals</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">Let’s start by covering some important terms and concepts about typography.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec28"><em>Typeface categories</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">The main difference between fonts is whether or not they include <em>serifs</em>, which are the little decorative bits at the end of letters. This book’s content text uses a serif font (Tisa Pro), while the headlines use a sans-serif font (literally <em>without</em> serif — and Tisa Sans Pro is the headline font here) <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig20">FIGURE 2-20</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig20"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig20.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-20:</strong> Sans-serif versus serif typefaces. Tisa Sans Pro on the left, Tisa Pro on the right.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">In general, serif fonts are easier to read in printed text, and sans-serif fonts are easier to read on a screen. The serifs in printed text help the eye quickly read the letters, whereas on screen it’s harder to render the tiny serifs, which end up hindering readability (though, with the advent of newer and crisper screens, this distinction is going away).</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><a id="page_30"/>Fonts can be further broken down into several categories <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig21">FIGURE 2-21</a>)</strong>:</p>

<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Monospace:</strong> Every letter takes up the same amount of space. In other typefaces, thin letters such as “i” take up less space than wide letters such as “m.”</p></li>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec29"><em>Leading and line height</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">Make sure your lines of text aren’t too close together, which creates a feeling of clutter. The space between lines of text in a paragraph is known in typography-land as “leading” (from the strips of lead that typographers added between the lines of text when they hand-set type into the printing press). In <span class="small">CSS</span> the same concept is referred to as “line height” <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig22">FIGURE 2-22</a>).</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt1">Aim for a Goldilocks amount of spacing — a paragraph is hard to read if the lines of text are too close or too far apart. Give lines of text a little space to improve readability and reduce the feeling of clutter, but not so much that they become hard to read. 1.6 is a good starting ratio (e.g., 12px font size with 19.2px line height, 14px font size with 22.4px line height). Feel free to <a id="page_31"/>play around with your spacing to find what feels right for your specific situation.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig22"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig22.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-22:</strong> Text can be too close or too far apart, hindering readability. The center example is the most readable.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec30"><em>Kerning and letterspacing</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">Kerning is the process of changing the spacing between individual letters, and letterspacing is the spacing between all letters (changing it affects every letter, whereas kerning affects only a pair of letters). As with leading, we don’t want too much or too little. Thankfully, the defaults set for us when text is displayed in browsers are fairly ideal, but <span class="small">CSS</span> allows you to adjust the amount of spacing between letters using the letterspacing property. Graphics programs also allow you to tinker with kerning. Large headlines sometimes look nicer with some space removed, whereas small text can benefit from adding some space <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig23">FIGURE 2-23</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig23"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig23.jpg"/></div>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec31"><a id="page_32"/><strong>Typography principles</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">Now, let’s cover some important principles to keep in mind as you work on typography.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec32"><em>Limit designs to two typefaces</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">Using lots of typefaces can lend to chaos and clutter. Simplify by choosing one typeface for headlines and a second for content; this will make your design look much cleaner. You can use bolding, italics, uppercase, and other stylistic treatments to create more styles in your text <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig24">FIGURE 2-24</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig24"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig24.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-24:</strong> Lots of typefaces make a design feel chaotic (left). Fewer typefaces are easier to wrangle and look more professional.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec33"><em>Avoid justifying or centering text</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">Justified text is text that fits entirely in a column; both margins are justified rather than just one. Based on <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch00lev1sec11">Section 2.1</a>, where we discussed lining things up, you might be tempted to use justified text to create an even line on the right of the text <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig25">FIGURE 2-25</a>)</strong>.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">However, justified text creates some serious issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="noindent5">Spacing words out to fit a column can add large, unsightly spaces between words.</p></li>
<li><a id="page_33"/><p class="noindent5">Large spaces between words can line up across multiple lines of text, creating an unsightly visual “river” of white space <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig26">FIGURE 2-26</a>)</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig25"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig25.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-25:</strong> “Ragged-right” text (right), is easier to read than justified text (left).</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig26"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig26.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-26:</strong> Justified text without hyphenation, on the left, has unsightly gaps and rivers of white space (marked in red).</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Unless you have a lot of time for tweaking, justified text is not worth it. Use left-aligned (otherwise known as ragged-right) text to ensure easy readability.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec34"><a id="page_34"/><em>Centered text can be challenging</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">Centered text can work for headlines, but when in doubt, left align your text against an underlying grid so it all lines up for easier readability. Paragraphs of text are <em>especially</em> hard to read when centered because the starting point for each line changes <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig27">FIGURE 2-27</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig27"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig27.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-27:</strong> The uneven left edge of centered content makes it harder to read.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec35"><em>Line length</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">A paragraph becomes significantly harder to read if there are more than 75 or fewer than 45 characters per sentence. Make sure your paragraphs have an appropriate width (or font size) so that the lines are just long enough for maximum readability <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig28">FIGURE 2-28</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig28"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig28.jpg"/></div>

<p class="noindentt1">Now that you’ve absorbed this new information, let’s cover some shortcuts that’ll make designing your typography much faster.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec37"><em>Free font resources</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">The most beautiful fonts usually cost a lot of money — worth it to professional designers but perhaps not to hobbyist designers like ourselves.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Thankfully, sites such as Google Fonts (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/32">hellobks.com/hwd/32</a></em>) <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig29">FIGURE 2-29</a>)</strong> and Adobe Fonts (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/33">hellobks.com/hwd/33</a></em>) <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig30">FIGURE 2-30</a>)</strong> offer us beautiful font options that we can use in both online and print designs. Google Fonts allows you to download the fonts, and Adobe’s Creative Cloud feature makes Adobe Fonts’ web fonts available in design and slide programs.</p>

<p class="noindentt1">Like color, typography is a huge, fascinating subject. Hopefully this brief section has given you a good overview that gets you started and gives you a good platform for learning more.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">By narrowing down your font choices to those that have already been vetted by others and reducing the number of fonts in your design, you’ll be well on your way to a design with beautiful typography.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Next up, we’re going to cover white space and giving your design room to breathe.</p>
<p class="sec" id="ch00lev1sec40"><a id="page_39"/>SECTION 2.4</p>
<p class="sec1" id="ch00lev1sec41">WHITE SPACE</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><span class="small">IF YOU USE ONLY ONE TOOL TO IMPROVE YOUR DESIGN</span>, I guarantee that white space would make the biggest difference. White space is the <em>ultimate</em> clutter reducer.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Also known as negative space, white space is empty space (not necessarily white). Essentially, white space is the space in your page left blank as well as the space between your elements <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig33">FIGURES 2-33</a>, <a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig34">2-34</a>, <span class="ash1">AND</span> <a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig35">2-35</a>)</strong>.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">When you’re designing, you might feel tempted to fill up your design with information, links, and other useful elements. After all, empty space can feel like wasted space, a place where you could add more content to convince your readers to stay longer, use your website, or buy your product. Why not fill up that space?</p>
<p class="noindentt1">However, a cluttered, crowded website — even one with more information — will perform worse than a website that makes up in simplicity and breathing room what it loses in information. White space is crucial to improving how your design is perceived and how well it works.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig33"><a id="page_40"/><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig33.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-33:</strong> Let’s inspect the white space on the Squarespace website.</p>

<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-34:</strong> White space, highlighted in red, is the space on the page withut content. Background images and textures generally count as white space.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig35"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig35.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-35:</strong> White space also refers to space between elements and lines of text.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec42"><a id="page_41"/><strong>White space fundamentals</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">Here are a few more reasons why white space is important.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec43"><em>White space improves comprehension</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">Cluttered websites and designs are harder to follow and overload the user with too much information. Simpler websites make it easier for users to digest the content you have displayed without being overwhelmed by extra, unnecessary detail <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig36">FIGURE 2-36</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig36"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig36.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-36:</strong> The Foursquare website has plenty of white space, letting the user know what to read and what to do next. Simplicity makes designs less confusing.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec44"><em>White space improves legibility</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">We’re going to repeat a bit of information we covered in the last section just to make sure it sticks.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Remember when we covered leading (the space between lines) in the typography section? White space in the form of leading <a id="page_42"/>improves readability. Too little mushes sentences together, but too much leading can also worsen readability — this is definitely a case where you should shoot for the Goldilocks zone. Adding space between lines of text and elements will help users read what you’re trying to say <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig37">FIGURE 2-37</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig37"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig37.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-37:</strong> Paragraphs with too little space between lines are hard to read.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Similarly, the space between letters (kerning) also matters. Making sure your letters aren’t too squished together and have enough space between them will make your text easier to read <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig38">FIGURE 2-38</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig38"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig38.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-38:</strong> Letters that are too close together also are hard to read. Add some space to improve readability.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec45"><em>White space improves calls to action</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">More items crowding a space make it a harder for someone to identify your call to action (also known as your <span class="small">CTA</span>). Whatever element you want your reader to use, they’ll be more likely to see and use if it stands out with a lot of white space — drawing attention to the <span class="small">CTA</span> while reducing distractions from other elements <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig39">FIGURE 2-39</a>)</strong>.</p>

<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-39:</strong> The introduction text and button stand out with copious amounts of white space in the T4S website.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec46"><em>White space helps set a tone</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">Open, blank space is associated with luxury and quality, whereas designs with less space and elements pushed up against each other is associated with a more thrifty, chaotic tone — like a busy flea market versus a luxury brand storefront.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">If you want your design to give the impression of luxury, professionalism, elegance, or superiority, you can bolster that impression by using white space liberally <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig40">FIGURES 2-40</a> <a class="ash1">AND</a> <a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig41">2-41</a>)</strong>.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec47"><a id="page_44"/><strong>Quick theory</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">As a new designer, your instinct is going to push you toward less space, not more. Let’s look at where you can add white space in your designs.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec48"><em>Space between lines of text</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">White space starts at the content level. Your text needs space to breathe. Make sure you give the lines of text enough room to improve readability <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig42">FIGURE 2-42</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig42"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig42.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-42:</strong> White space in the form of space between lines of text.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec49"><em>Space between elements</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">Now that we have our text figured out, let’s focus on the spacing in between elements. This means the space between your content and paragraphs and other paragraphs, or paragraphs and their headline — any element near another element <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig43">FIGURE 2-43</a>)</strong>.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Spacing between individual elements helps set the elements apart from each other, so the eye can more effectively pick out the separate groups. In <strong><a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig43">FIGURE 2-43</a></strong> the space between the <a id="page_45"/>newsletter signup (to the right of the article title) and the title ensures that the two elements remain distinct objects.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig43"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig43.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-43:</strong> White space in the form of space between elements.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec50"><em>Space between groups of elements</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">Taking the macro view, we also want to make sure <em>groups</em> of elements have enough space around them. This means creating space between columns of elements and other columns, rows and other rows, and your entire page of elements within its container (such as the browser window) <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig44">FIGURE 2-44</a>)</strong>.</p>

<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-44:</strong> White space in the form of space between groups of elements.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec51"><a id="page_46"/><strong>Shortcuts</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">Here are a couple of easy tips to help you use white space more effectively in your designs.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec52"><em>Double white space between elements</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">Use more white space than you think you need! Yes, there can be such thing as too much, but using more than you think is a good rule of thumb when you’re starting out. Try to double what your initial instinct tells you is appropriate. Go farther than you’re comfortable, take a break, and then re-evaluate. What might have felt too airy at first may now feel natural and balanced.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec53"><em>Make sure you have enough leading in your paragraphs</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">Repeating our typography section again for emphasis! Remember to keep enough leading (vertical white space between lines in a paragraph) so your paragraph is easy to read.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec54"><strong>Real-life examples</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">Removing white space from my personal website illustrates the how drastically white space can alter a design. Without white space, the site looks cluttered and amateur. Adding white space, especially in the very airy middle, makes the design look more professional and deliberate <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig45">FIGURE 2-45</a>)</strong>.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Let’s add more white space to our widget: between individual lines of text and between individual elements within the widget <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig46">FIGURE 2-46</a>)</strong>.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Doesn’t that feel a lot cleaner? I also evened out the spacing between elements (the same amount of space around the elements within the container, as well as the same amount of <a id="page_47"/>space between the headline and the content, and the content and the form). This even amount of spacing also reduces the clutter and chaos.</p>

<p class="line"> </p>
<p class="noindentt1">Type, color, and lining things up can do a lot, but adding breathing room is the biggest tool in your decluttering basket to build a better-looking design.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Next up, we’re going to tackle layout as a whole — moving from these micro issues and starting to take a macro view of our design!</p>
<p class="sec" id="ch00lev1sec55"><a id="page_48"/>SECTION 2.5</p>
<p class="sec1" id="ch00lev1sec56">LAYOUT AND HIERARCHY</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><span class="small">THE LAST FEW SECTIONS DEALT WITH CONCRETE CONCEPTS</span>: color, type, and white space. Now we’re going to consider more abstract concepts: layout and hierarchy.</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><em>Layout</em> refers to the way that information is arranged and prioritized; the choices that you make about layout affect how well your message is read and understood. We already covered the grid: lining up elements to reduce the little pixel differences that can make a design feel cluttered. Positioning and hierarchy of elements are other important aspects of layout.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Elements could go literally anywhere — how do you identify their proper places?</p>
<p class="noindentt1">As English readers, we read left to right, meaning that our eyes naturally start at the top left of a page. Studies have shown that website users look at websites in an “F” pattern <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig47">FIGURES 2-47</a> <span class="ash1">AND</span> <a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig48">2-48</a>)</strong>.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Take advantage of this discovery and build layouts that start at the top left of the page and continue to the right and down <a id="page_49"/>from there. This is why most websites place their logo in the top left rather than at the bottom.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig47"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig47.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-47:</strong> The Google Ventures website is a good example of the “F” pattern.</p>

<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-48:</strong> Eye-tracking heatmaps show how readers scan websites in an “F” pattern.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">On to hierarchy! When you’re designing, some elements are more important than others. Your job is to establish a visual hierarchy so your readers and users can see which items are important. Essentially, visual hierarchy guides your audience and helps them decide what to look at first <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig49">FIGURE 2-49</a>)</strong>.</p>

<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-49:</strong> The left block has no hierarchy. On the right, the increased size of one element makes it stand out first.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">A page without hierarchy appears flat and boring. There are several options for indicating importance and increasing visibility:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Size:</strong> Larger items are more important and eye catching.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Color:</strong> More saturated colors are more visible than low-contrast colors. Warmer colors (reds, oranges, yellows) are more visible than cooler colors (blues, purples, greens).</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Positioning:</strong> Items placed in the upper left corner have more importance.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Contrast:</strong> Items with more contrast will be more eye catching than items with low contrast.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>White space:</strong> Items with more white space around them appear more important.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Typography:</strong> Typeface selection can be another indicator of hierarchy. Using one font for your header and another for your content can create visual hierarchy.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindentt1"><a id="page_51"/>Typography is particularly important for web work. The following paragraph has no visual hierarchy, giving every item the same importance:</p>
<div class="cont">
<p class="noindentt1">We’re having a party! You’re invited to the annual celebration of the Zuni Cafe. Celebrations will be held at Zuni Cafe, New York, at 6 pm. Formal dress required; please RSVP.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindentt1">We can increase hierarchy by adding some white space:</p>
<div class="cont">
<p class="noindentt1">We’re having a party!</p>
<p class="noindentt1">You’re invited to the annual celebration of the Zuni Cafe. Celebrations will be held at Zuni Cafe, New York, at 6 pm.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Formal dress required; please RSVP.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindentt1">Once we start playing with typography and color, hierarchy becomes much more evident:</p>
<div class="cont">
<p class="noindentt1"><span class="blue2"><strong>We’re having a party!</strong></span></p>
<p class="noindentt1">You’re invited to the annual celebration of the Zuni Cafe. Celebrations will be held at Zuni Cafe, New York, at 6 pm.</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><span class="small ash2">FORMAL DRESS REQUIRED; PLEASE RSVP.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="noindentt1">All three are readable, but the last example is the most visually interesting and makes the hierarchy of information immediately clear.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">How can you tell whether you’ve properly added hierarchy to your design? Try the squint test. Squint at your design until the design blurs.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">When the content disappears and you can only see the layout and elements abstractly, it’s a lot easier to see what pops out first. On <em>New York Times</em> website <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig50">FIGURE 2-50</a>)</strong>, the logo and <a id="page_52"/>images pop first (especially the orange button on the ad, which might not be ideal because it distracts from the website itself). In the content, the centered image and leftmost article with the largest headline text also stand out.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig50"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig50.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-50:</strong> A blurred version of the <em>New York Time</em>s home page. When you can’t read the text, content hierarchy becomes more clear.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">When you’re working on a design, write a list down of all your elements and rank them in order of importance. Then look at your design and rank the elements based on how they look in the design. Do the two lists match up?</p>
<p class="noindentt1">When we fail to establish visual hierarchy, the reader or user won’t know where to start or end on your design; this confusion could reduce user engagement and conversions. The design won’t work as well.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">If something needs to look more important and higher in the visual hierarchy, play with the design and make some changes based on the ideas mentioned above — change the color or positioning, add spacing, improve the typography — until the item is more visually different.</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><a id="page_53"/>If you’d like to break the “F” pattern in your design, you can do that by establishing proper hierarchy using the visual tools we listed above. For example, draw attention to an element at the top right of the page by making it larger or more colorful. The “F” pattern is a great starting point with natural hierarchy due to a typical placement of elements, and hierarchy is in our toolbox to break that pattern while still achieving a natural-feeling website.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec57"><strong>Real-life examples</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">Let’s analyze our widget to determine some of the ways that we’re establishing visual hierarchy <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig51">FIGURE 2-51</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig51"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig51.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-51:</strong> A brighter color for our download button raises its visual hierarchy. We don’t want to accidentally hide this important button!</p>
<p class="noindentt1">The first two important things we see are the headline and the login button. The headline is both a different color from the content and has a larger font size. The login button is a contrasting, warmer color than the rest of the widget. You’d probably see <a id="page_54"/>the headline or button first and then move through the rest of the widget — so we already established proper hierarchy when we updated the color and type in the earlier sections. Go us!</p>
<p class="line"> </p>
<p class="noindentt1">We went over a lot of these principles — color, typography, and white space — in earlier sections. Layout is where these concepts really start working together. Now we’re going to move from visual design on its own to thinking more about user experience.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">More about content and hierarchy in the following section, where we’ll talk content principles!</p>
<p class="sec" id="ch00lev1sec58"><a id="page_55"/>SECTION 2.6</p>
<p class="sec1" id="ch00lev1sec59">CONTENT</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><span class="small">AT FIRST GLANCE, A DISCUSSION ABOUT CONTENT</span> might seem out of place in a book about design, but making good choices about words and content plays a huge part in ending clutter.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">This section covers content principles and strategy to help you create content that users will read and enjoy and that improves how well your design works.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Dense paragraphs of content contribute to the feeling of clutter, especially when content is viewed on a screen (rather than in print). Studies have shown that online readers are more likely to skim content than read in full. Big chunks of text are more likely to be skipped than read <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig52">FIGURE 2-52</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="cont">
<p class="noindentt1">People rarely read Web pages word by word; instead, they scan the page, picking out individual words and sentences.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>How Users Read on the Web, Nielsen Norman Group (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/45">hellobks.com/hwd/45</a></em>)</em></p>
</div>
<p class="noindentt1">First off, when it comes to content, less is generally more.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig52"><a id="page_56"/><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig52.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-52:</strong> Users read web content fully only if their interest has already been piqued—otherwise, they skim content quickly as they look for something that grabs their attention.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">It’s tempting when writing web content to cover every possible detail and use big, professional words. Instead, it’s preferable to write less and use smaller, clearer words that help folks understand what you’re trying to say using the fewest number of words. Big paragraphs of text are an indicator of clutter — a good rule of thumb is no more than two to three sentences per paragraph.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">When faced with a giant paragraph of information, try to shorten and simplify it. Let’s look at a great example from <em>Simple and Usable Web, Mobile, and Interaction Design</em> by Giles Colborne (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/46">hellobks.com/hwd/46</a></em>).</p>
<div class="cont">
<p class="noindentt1"><a id="page_57"/>Please note that although Chrome is supported for both Mac and Windows operating systems, it is recommended that all users of this site switch to the most up-to-date version of the Firefox web browser for the best possible results.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindentt1">While the above is technically correct and covers all the bases, it’s rather long and wordy. We can shorten:</p>
<div class="cont">
<p class="noindentt1">For best results, use the latest version of Firefox. Chrome for Mac and Windows is also supported.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindentt1">Still correct, it covers everything we want to cover, but is much shorter and easier to understand at a glance.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">It can be hard to limit yourself when it comes to content. I get it — you have so much important stuff to say! But remember: no matter how much you write, the reader will still only read 80, 100, maybe 200 words if you’re <em>really</em> lucky.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Provide more content than the reader is willing to read, and they’re likely to skim or abandon ship altogether.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">If you write comprehensive paragraphs that bury the most important pieces of information deep inside, you’re taking a big risk that the reader will waste their 80 words to read less important information.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">The more content you present, the less control you have about what the reader actually consumes.</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><a id="page_58"/>If you can’t shorten something by using fewer words, you can also try breaking a paragraph into bullet points. Take this paragraph for example:</p>
<div class="cont">
<p class="noindentt1">We made a bunch of changes: The registration chapter has been split in two, between adding registration and then associating users with objects. The chapter was giant before, so this makes it more manageable. Screenshots of the admin have been updated to reflect the new Django 1.9 styles. The few minor typos have been fixed. Updated the version of django-registration-redux that we use to 1.3. Last but not least, the Introduction has been updated.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindentt1">This paragraph would be better suited to bullet points:</p>
<div class="cont">
<p class="noindentt1">We made a bunch of changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="noindent5">The registration chapter has been split in two, between adding registration and then associating users with objects. The chapter was giant before, so this makes it more manageable.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5">Screenshots of the admin have been updated to reflect the new Django 1.9 styles.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5">The few minor typos have been fixed. Updated the version of django-registration-redux that we use to 1.3.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5">The Introduction has been updated.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="noindentt1">Bullets and other visual aids help the reader pick out pieces of information from a block of content, making it more likely that the content will be read.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">I also encourage strategic bolding. Especially in technical documents, it helps draw attention to the most important part of a sentence, further making your content easier to skim.</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><a id="page_59"/>For example:</p>
<div class="cont">
<p class="noindentt1"><strong>We made a bunch of changes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>The registration chapter has been split in two</strong>, between adding registration and then associating users with objects. The chapter was giant before so this makes it more manageable.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Screenshots of the admin have been updated</strong> to reflect the new Django 1.9 styles.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>The few minor typos have been fixed.</strong> Updated the version of django-registration-redux that we use to 1.3.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>The Introduction has been updated.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="noindentt1">The most important parts have been bolded, so it’s easy for readers to skim the content, find the parts that are most interesting to them, and read further if they like.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Note we also changed the formatting of the headline! Let’s take a look at headlines in general.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">One of the best ways to organize your content is by using headlines. These are parts of the text that are presented in a larger and more prominent style to introduce the content that follows, making the text easier to skim and read.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Headlines can suffer from wordiness — you also want these parts of your text to be as short and clear as possible to aid understanding and keep up excitement. For a better user experience, shorten and clarify your headlines, and also make sure that they’re exciting and talk benefits for your reader.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">For example, look at two versions of my website advertising my other books, the <em>Hello Web App</em> series. In <strong><a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig53">FIGURE 2-53</a></strong>, the headline is wordy and boring. In <strong><a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig54">FIGURE 2-54</a></strong>, the headline has <a id="page_60"/>been rewritten to be short and clear, talking about what the book <em>does</em> for the visitor of the website, making it more likely that the visitor will want to explore my website further.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig53"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig53.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-53:</strong> The <em>Hello Web App</em> website with a very wordy headline. Technically correct, but not very interesting.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig54"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig54.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-54:</strong> This headline is still correct, but it’s more exciting and shorter, Most important, it does a better job of drawing attention to the benefit of the reader.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">If you’re writing headlines that introduce a product or are designed to draw attention, make sure you write them in a way that showcases the benefits of the product rather than just describing what the product does.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Changes like this can drastically affect your bottom line. In a study by webprofits (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/47">hellobks.com/hwd/47</a></em>) <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig55">FIGURE 2-55</a>)</strong>, <a id="page_61"/>changing the headline to talk about benefits rather than details increased the conversion rate (the number of people who bought the product) by 52.8 percent.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig55"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig55.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-55:</strong> Changing a headline to talk benefits, not details, led to a conversion increase of 52.8% in this example by webprofits (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/47">hellobks.com/hwd/47</a></em>).</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec60"><strong>Real-life examples</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">Back to our little widget! After learning about these content principles, we can update the content significantly <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig56">FIGURE 2-56</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig56"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig56.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-56:</strong> We’ve updated the content in our widget to make it shorter, clearer, more exciting, and easier to understand.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">We’ve shortened the content and made everything more exciting and personable. The form itself has been updated to a more friendly, human-sounding sentence, and the button has been <a id="page_62"/>updated from a simple “Login” to a more actionable-sounding “Log into your account”. All in all, these updates should make the widget easier to read, understand, and use at a glance.</p>
<p class="line"> </p>
<p class="noindentt1">Content might not initially feel like a part of design, but it really, really is huge. Content, writing, and words define how your design (especially web-focused design) will be consumed, so make sure that you spend some of your design time working on improving your content and writing.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">In short, cut down and clarify your content as much as possible. Keep your paragraphs to two to three sentences.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Make sure your content work extends to your headlines as well. If your headlines introduce a page or product, make sure the headline talks about how the page or product affects the reader rather than what it does.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Next up, we’re going to talk user experience!</p>
<p class="sec" id="ch00lev1sec61"><a id="page_63"/>SECTION 2.7</p>
<p class="sec1" id="ch00lev1sec62">USER EXPERIENCE</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><span class="small">THIS IS THE SECTION THAT TIES EVERYTHING TOGETHER.</span> All your work to make your designs enjoyable and easy to look at, your content short and easy to parse, your layouts easy to understand — all these concepts tie into your <em>user experience.</em></p>
<p class="noindentt1">User experience (<span class="small">UX</span>) is the overall experience a user has when using your website — the most important part of design.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Let’s break down the parts of user experience.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec63"><strong>Before designing</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">Before you can even begin design work, you should be able to answer a few primary questions: Who is your ideal user? What is their personal goal? What are your business goals? User experience research can help answer these questions.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">For example, someone visiting your personal website could be looking for more information about your work and what you do (their personal goal); your business goal could be to sign them up for your personal newsletter.</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><a id="page_64"/>Or, for a web page for a new iPhone app, your user would be looking for information about your app and how to download it; your business goal would be to get as many downloads as possible.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">We’re looking at two things: whether the customer is achieving what they want to achieve and whether you’re achieving your business goals. Hopefully your design achieves both.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">You may not need to do user experience research for a small personal project, but there are some things you can do in the predesign phase of big, important projects to help figure out your users and their goals.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec64"><em>Competitive analysis</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">In a nutshell, look at your competitors and analyze what they do well and not so well.</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch00lev1sec98">Section 3.1</a>: Finding Inspiration goes over how to look at websites and pick out ideas and things you can implement in your own design. Looking at competitors is a crucial part of creating your site’s user experience — it gives you a standard for comparison and helps you create a user experience superior to that of your competitors in order to lure their customers away.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec65"><em>Surveys and interviews</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">How will you learn what your customers want and need if you don’t ask them? A lot of web designers fall into the trap of designing for folks they don’t understand — for example, designing a wedding planning app if you haven’t planned a wedding yourself. You might have some thoughts and ideas about what a person planning their wedding needs, but you may make some incorrect assumptions unless you actually talk to someone planning their wedding.</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><a id="page_65"/>You want to have a good feel for what your ideal user wants and needs from your design. Having this knowledge will help you design better so the customer can achieve what they want, which should in turn allow you to achieve more of what you want.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec66"><strong>During the design process</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">You don’t want to spend the time implementing a design in code and then find out that folks are confused by a specific process or flow on your website (for example, the steps someone might take to buy an item). To avoid these missteps, you can do a “test run” of your design by using wireframes, prototypes, and usability testing.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec67"><em>Wireframes, prototypes, and usability testing</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">Wireframes and prototypes are fast, low-fidelity mock-ups of your design. Usability testing allows you to get feedback on layouts and interactions before you move forward with building the design in full. We’ll examine these concepts in more detail in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch00lev1sec102">Section 3.3</a>: Prototypes.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Wireframes and prototypes allow you to build quick-and-dirty mock-ups of your design and take them to others to get their feedback, learning whether your layout and flow make sense. Research shows that you can find and address big usability issues with a low-fidelity paper prototype just as easily as you can with a high-fidelity screen prototype. Save yourself valuable time by testing your layouts and flows early on.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec68"><strong>After launching your design</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">Once you’ve launched your design, you need to track whether you’re actually meeting your goals. How is your conversion rate? Do you have a low enough bounce rate, the percentage of <a id="page_66"/>people who immediately leave a website after loading? Are you getting good customer feedback? To help answer these questions, you can conduct a variety of tests to measure this data.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec69"><em>More usability testing</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">A crucial part of user experience is making sure you use appropriate analytics packages (such as Google Analytics: <em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/48">hellobks.com/hwd/48</a></em>) to collect data on how well your website is working after launch.</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><span class="small">A/B</span> testing is the process of testing a design change against your current website — such as testing two different versions of a headline and seeing which version better achieves your goal, such as increasing the number of purchases visitors make. These tests can be run after launch to continuously improve how well your designs are working.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Usability testing is the process of showing your designs to others to solicit feedback and ensure your website is usable by folks other than yourself, and we’ll cover that in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch00lev1sec106">Section 3.4</a>: Getting Feedback.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec70"><strong>Shortcuts</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">Now for my favorite part: the most important things to remember when thinking about user experience.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec71"><em>Make desired actions easy to find and use</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">Whatever you want your user to do, make sure the steps to complete that action are easy to find and straightforward to use.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">It makes no sense for your submit button to be plain and hard to see — a bright button stands out and makes forms easier to submit <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig57">FIGURE 2-57</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig57"><a id="page_67"/><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig57.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-57:</strong> Submit buttons for forms are important (as we talked about in the last section!) On the left, the button might be a bit too hard to find. The right button is easier to find and use.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Newsletter signup links shouldn’t be hidden in the content (remember what we said about skimmers). Display them on their own line to make them easier to see <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig58">FIGURE 2-58</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig58"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig58.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-58:</strong> If you want someone to sign up for your newsletter, don’t hide the link in your content. Push it out and make it visible.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec72"><em>Pay attention to website size</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">Slow downloading will prompt people to leave a website without seeing it. Pay attention to image size; with large screens and fast downloads the norm at home, it’s easy to forget that a lot of folks still browse websites on cell phones with poor reception or coffee shops with overloaded Wi-Fi. Also consider JavaScript; downloading lots of scripts will slow a website down, as will slow-performing scripts.</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><a id="page_68"/>Check your website in multiple browsers using multiple sizes and multiple download speeds to make sure it loads quickly.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec73"><em>Run usability tests</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">We’ll cover usability testing in more depth in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3</a>, <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch00lev1sec106">Section 3.4</a>: Getting Feedback. Essentially, show your designs to others and get their feedback, as hard as that might feel. As designers, we’re naturally blind to problems in our design, so it’s crucial to get more eyes on it to find those issues.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec74"><em>Include analytics</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">Make sure to include analytics-tracking software in your designs so you can see how your design is performing after launch. At the very least, consider Google Analytics (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/48">hellobks.com/hwd/48</a></em>) or a customer data platform such as Segment (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/49">hellobks.com/hwd/49</a></em>) that you can tie in with Google Analytics and other analytics platforms.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec75"><strong>Real-life examples</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">Going back to our widget <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig59">FIGURE 2-59</a>)</strong>, we can see that our login button is a bright, easy-to-see color. Users aren’t going to be confused about how to submit!</p>
<p class="noindentt1">User experience is one of those things that’s hard to show in a book. Remember that you should do your best to try to understand your audience, pay attention to your pages and how a person moves between them (and make sure that’s easy to do), get feedback from your designs from outside sources, and pay attention to how well your design is doing after launch.</p>

<p class="sec1" id="ch00lev1sec77">IMAGES AND IMAGERY</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><span class="small">SO FAR WE’VE BEEN WORKING SOLELY WITH LINES</span>, boxes, and text for your designs, but images (and imagery such as icons and graphics) can play a huge part. In this section we’ll address where you can find images to use for your project and how to use them effectively.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">First off, let’s cover royalties and licensing. As easy as it is to right-click and “save as” almost any image you find on the internet, you can’t use just anything you find. Images have copyright protections, and reusing an image created by someone else without permission is illegal.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">An overview of terms you should keep an eye out for:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Rights-managed images:</strong> Should include additional terms indicating allowable uses for the image.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Royalty-free images:</strong> Generally you can use the image <em>as long as</em> you correspond to the terms of the image. For example, a lot of royalty-free images can be used only in not-for-profit contexts, meaning you cannot use them for any application in which you could potentially make money.</p></li>
<li><a id="page_71"/><p class="noindent5"><strong>Creative commons:</strong> A system created for content creators to allow their work to be used without requiring express permission. Creative commons images can be licensed in many different ways, from requiring attribution, denying derivatives (you can’t alter the image yourself), prohibiting commercial use, or allowing any use.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindentt1">If an image doesn’t specify that you can use it, then <em>you are not allowed to use it for your project</em>. The vast majority of the world has adopted the Berne Convention, which states that copyrights are granted to the author by default — even if not specified. You don’t actually need to put little copyright notice footers on your website!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec78"><strong>Fundamentals</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">Let’s cover some quick fundamentals to remember when you’re adding imagery to your designs.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec79"><em>Don’t feel like you’re required to use photos or icons</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">Don’t fret that you <em>need</em> to use photos of people in your designs. Type and screenshots of your product can go a long way <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig60">FIGURE 2-60</a>)</strong>.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">By playing with typography — using different fonts and styles — you can create a beautiful and clean website without needing to fuss with images.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">If you’re building a product for the web, the website for that product doesn’t need much more than screenshots <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig61">FIGURE 2-61</a>)</strong>.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">You can always add images and imagery later — starting out with a clean, text-based website could help you launch faster without nitpicking over these details.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig60"><a id="page_72"/><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig60.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-60:</strong> John Gruber’s Daring Fireball website is a beautiful, successful design using all text (other than the icon in the logo).</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig61"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig61.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-61:</strong> The T4S website is clean, featuring screenshots of their product.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec80"><a id="page_73"/><em>Faces are powerful</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">Happy faces provoke happy emotions; angry faces provoke angry emotions. You can use a face in your design to emphasize the emotion you want and draw the eye to the most important part of the page <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig62">FIGURE 2-62</a>)</strong>. This is a powerful tool in your design toolbox.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig62"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig62.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-62:</strong> Dan Mall’s personal website. Dan’s photo draws the eye, and his gaze leads us to the introduction text.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec81"><em>Pay attention to file size</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">Images can easily bloat a website’s size very quickly, leading to slower download times and frustrated users who don’t stick around. Additionally, more screens are going retina with higher resolutions, with smaller pixels leading to crisper more crisp displays — making photos and images at the old resolution look blurry.</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><a id="page_74"/>Some principles to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Make sure your images are the maximum necessary size.</strong> No sense in putting a 2000px image into a 1200px box.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Provide retina and non-retina images.</strong> Set up your <span class="small">HTML</span> and <span class="small">CSS</span> so folks using a retina screen can download the more detailed, higher-resolution images, and those on a traditional screen will get the smaller images with no wasted pixels. This is a great guide on doing so: <em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/54">hellobks.com/hwd/54</a></em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec82"><em>Beware of stock photos that look like stock photos</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">Searching for “stock photos” on Google will get you to multiple websites that purport to offer a lot of great options you can use (paid and free), but there are a whole lot of low-quality images. Take a look at some of the giant websites like iStock <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig63">FIGURE 2-63</a>)</strong>, but try to find images that feel more natural than the example image (digital construction in the future!).</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig63"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig63.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-63:</strong> iStock (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/53">hellobks.com/hwd/53</a></em>) has a lot of stock images to go through, but beware of images that feel overly posed and unnatural.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec83"><a id="page_75"/><em>Icons</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">While images are great for backgrounds and big elements, icons are more like supporting characters — little graphics that support your content and design. You don’t <em>need</em> icons, but they can make your design feel unique.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Icons support information absorption by creating a graphical representation of content. The Kite website uses icons effectively to draw the eye to the three columns of features using abstract representations of the content <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig64">FIGURE 2-64</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig64"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig64.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-64:</strong> Kite’s website icons are simple but effective.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Of course, this is also a place you need to pay attention to licensing. Just like photos, icons are copyrighted.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec84"><strong>Shortcuts</strong></h3>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec85"><em>Stock photo websites</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">My favorite resource for natural-looking stock photos is Unsplash (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/56">hellobks.com/hwd/56</a></em>) <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig65">FIGURE 2-65</a>)</strong>, which features free Creative Commons images.</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><a id="page_76"/>Other stock photo websites include IM Free (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/60">hellobks.com/hwd/60</a></em>), picjumbo (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/61">hellobks.com/hwd/61</a></em>), iStock (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/62">hellobks.com/hwd/62</a></em>), Gratisography (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/63">hellobks.com/hwd/63</a></em>), and PhotoPin (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/57">hellobks.com/hwd/57</a></em>) <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig66">FIGURE 2-66</a>)</strong>.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec86"><em>Imagery (icons, graphics, and illustrations)</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">To add that little special touch to your designs using icons, try either websites with predesigned icons, such as The Noun Project (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/58">hellobks.com/hwd/58</a></em>) <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig67">FIGURE 2-67</a>),</strong> or get them custom designed for you through websites such as Fiverr (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/59">hellobks.com/hwd/59</a></em>) <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig68">FIGURE 2-68</a>)</strong> and Upwork (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/64">hellobks.com/hwd/64</a></em>).</p>

<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-65:</strong> Unsplash (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/56">hellobks.com/hwd/56</a></em>) is a great source for natural-looking images.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec87"><a id="page_77"/><strong>Real-life examples</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">Our widget was already readable, well spaced, and usable—but by adding some polish through a background pattern, a subtle drop-shadow, and a fun icon, we can really elevate its appearance (<strong><a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig69">FIGURE 2-69</a></strong>). We can often get away without these little details (and I often personally skip this effort on some of my own quick design work), but as you can see, it can be time well spent on important design work.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig69"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig69.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-69:</strong> Our widget was fairly good already, but adding a background pattern, a light drop-shadow, and a fun icon takes it to another level.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Next up, we’re going to cover some random and fun design tidbits that didn’t fit into these earlier sections.</p>
<p class="sec" id="ch00lev1sec88"><a id="page_78"/>SECTION 2.9</p>
<p class="sec1" id="ch00lev1sec89">EXTRA TIDBITS</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><span class="small">LET’S WRAP UP THIS CHAPTER</span> by going over some fun design tidbits. This section is a catchall for some things we covered a bit of in earlier sections and some that didn’t fit perfectly in one category; all should be interesting and will add a bit of spice into your design work.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec90"><strong>Start simple</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">When you’re starting out, deliberately choosing simple interfaces and designs will make your life easier. Simple layouts, simple user interface (<span class="small">UI</span>), and simple <span class="small">UX</span> might make you feel boring (you’re not!), but they are effective and easier for newbies to wrangle <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig70">FIGURE 2-70</a>)</strong>.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Don’t be ashamed to start out small — after all, you can always add more elements or redesign after your first iteration.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec91"><strong>Consider the “rule of thirds”</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">The “rule of thirds” is a concept usually applied in photography. Centering an object in a photograph makes the <a id="page_79"/>photograph feel boring. Instead, divide the image horizontally and vertically into thirds; the intersections of these lines are great guidelines for placing points of interest, creating photos that are visually more interesting <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig71">FIGURE 2-71</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig70"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig70.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-70:</strong> Appcanary’s website is simple and very effective.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">This also can apply to web design — one of the reasons why a three-column website design is visually appealing. You can also place your background images and important features (such as faces) along these lines <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig72">FIGURE 2-72</a>)</strong>.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Again, this is another rule that can (and often should be) broken, but it’s a good concept to keep in mind.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec92"><strong>Avoid pure black</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">Pure black — which doesn’t occur in nature — can make your design feel stark and unnatural. Instead, use color that is not quite black; in hexadecimal, something like <span class="literal">#222222</span> is great for headlines and <span class="literal">#444444</span> for text, rather than <span class="literal">#000000</span>. You can also use the specific CSS property <span class="small">RGBA</span> (<span class="literal">color:</span> <span class="literal">rgb</span><span class="literal">a(</span><span class="literal">0,0,0,0.2);</span>) so your text darkens the background color rather than using pure gray <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig73">FIGURES 2-73</a> <span class="ash1">AND</span> <a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig74">2-74</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig71"><a id="page_80"/><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig71.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-71:</strong> The rule of thirds. Points of interest aren’t centered — rather, points of interest are placed along the “thirds” intersections for more compelling layouts.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig72"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig72.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-72:</strong> Comovee’s website background basically aligns with the page in thirds.</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><a id="page_81"/>White is less likely to invoke this feeling of starkness, but it still could be worthwhile to play with using almost-white in your designs.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec93"><strong>Lighting should come from above</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">If you’re adding shadows or gradients to your design elements, set it up so that it looks like it’s been lit head-on or from above <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig75">FIGURE 2-75</a>)</strong>. Objects lit from below look unnatural, as we’re used to light normally coming from above (the sun, overhead lights, and so on) <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig76">FIGURE 2-76</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig73"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig73.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-73:</strong> Black is readable but stark and a bit hard on the eyes.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig74"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig74.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-74:</strong> Dark gray is still readable but a lot easier to look at on a computer screen.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig75"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig75.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-75:</strong> Lit from above, the button feels like it’s popping out naturally from the page.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig76"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig76.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-76:</strong> The button looks unnatural when lit from below.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec94"><a id="page_82"/><strong>Contrast highlights what’s important</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">In your designs, widgets, and forms, you can play with contrast to make something stand out (or stand back). This works particularly well with form elements, when you want to visually indicate what is editable versus what is just help text <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig77">FIGURE 2-77</a>)</strong>.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec95"><strong>Colors look different depending on the environment</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">The lovely peach in your color palette might suddenly look brown when placed on a bright orange background <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig78">FIGURE 2-78</a>)</strong>. It’s not your palette, it’s our eyes — our perception of color changes depending on the environment. Feel free to alter the colors on your palette a bit so they visually match their source, even in a new environment. Your color palette doesn’t have to be set in stone!</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig77"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig77.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-77:</strong> The form’s help is lighter compared to the main text, indicating that it’s less important.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig78"><a id="page_83"/><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig78.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-78:</strong> The inner square is the same color in both images, but looks significantly darker and browner in the example on the right.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec96"><strong>Be careful about overlaying text on images</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">We went over typography, readability, and images in separate sections. Combining images and text can be hard to do because the image itself can hinder readability (and ergo, how well your design works for the user) <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig79">FIGURE 2-79</a>)</strong>. Try overlaying transparent color on top of an image (black is typically used, but you could also try white or colors) <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig80">FIGURE 2-80</a>)</strong>, adding a solid block of color behind the text, or blurring the image behind the text if readability seems like it’ll be a problem.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig79"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig79.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-79:</strong> Text can become unreadable depending on the background.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig80"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig80.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-80:</strong> Darkening the background ensures that text will always be readable.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec97"><a id="page_84"/><strong>Some tips when designing for repeated workflows</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">This book mostly focuses on designing web pages that try to convert a first-time visitor into a certain action, which means we’re trying to avoid designs that require any kind of learning curve.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">However, internal tools that will be used many times every day allow us to make a tradeoff between requiring some upfront learning and making our users’ workflow more efficient. Examples include creating keyboard shortcuts or allowing more clutter in order to make vital information available in one place. The Bloomberg Terminal — borderline terrifying for novices but irreplaceable for professionals — is one example of purposeful clutter in expert interfaces <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig81">FIGURE 2-81</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch2fig81"><img alt="image" src="../images/02fig81.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-81:</strong> The Bloomberg Terminal design is cluttered and chaotic, but with purpose.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">In an ideal scenario, we could create the best of both worlds: a design both intuitive and beautiful that lets users perform any task as fast as possible. But reality dictates that we usually need to compromise on either simplicity or function. The decision about which to favor must be made consciously.</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><a id="page_85"/>And that’s the end of the chapter on theory and shortcuts!</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Over the last few sections, our widget has slowly improved. Here’s how we’ve transformed it <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch2fig82">FIGURE 2-82</a>)</strong>.</p>

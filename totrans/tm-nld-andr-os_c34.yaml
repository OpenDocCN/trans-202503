    “The currency of Android.”

    up for my lack of education by just working hard and putting in an unhealthy amount
    of hours. There were times in the first four to five years where it was essentially
    all I did when I was awake. And I didn’t get as much sleep as I should. I know
    I wasn’t alone on that.

    morning was 9:30 and the earliest I left was at 1:30 am. I remember getting home
    at 2:30 am and I just wanted to do something that was not work, to reclaim my
    life. I sat in bed playing this game, *Game Dev Story*. I could hardly keep awake,
    but I was, out of spite, like, ‘I’m going to have fun playing this game!’ And
    I realized that what I was actually doing for the last 20 minutes was simulating
    overseeing a software project.^([1](#c34-footnote-1))

    as we possibly could. I always compared it to some endurance athletic event; miserable

    some low-level mental illness you keep signing up for again and again.”

    were three weeks after they stopped working on the release before the device was
    available for people to purchase. “We had nothing to do. We didn’t know if we
    were still in business. I remember being at home at 5 pm, which had never happened.
    I didn’t know what to do. What do people do when they’re home?”

    The team got back to working hard and cranking more releases out. For one thing,
    there was constant pressure of delivering each release in time for partner hardware
    launches. Also, there was a team-wide desire to make Android successful. Although
    you could squint and see shades of things to come, that first product was not
    game-changing. It was a decent smartphone, but not enough to really capture the
    world’s attention. So the team kept running, because they had a long way to go
    to make Android realize its potential.

    up for my lack of education by just working hard and putting in an unhealthy amount
    of hours. There were times in the first four to five years where it was essentially
    all I did when I was awake. And I didn’t get as much sleep as I should. I know
    I wasn’t alone on that.

    morning was 9:30 and the earliest I left was at 1:30 am. I remember getting home
    at 2:30 am and I just wanted to do something that was not work, to reclaim my
    life. I sat in bed playing this game, *Game Dev Story*. I could hardly keep awake,
    but I was, out of spite, like, ‘I’m going to have fun playing this game!’ And
    I realized that what I was actually doing for the last 20 minutes was simulating
    overseeing a software project.^([1](#c34-footnote-1))

    were three weeks after they stopped working on the release before the device was
    available for people to purchase. “We had nothing to do. We didn’t know if we
    were still in business. I remember being at home at 5 pm, which had never happened.
    I didn’t know what to do. What do people do when they’re home?”

    5 点，我在家里，这种情况以前从未发生过。我不知道该做什么。人们在家里都做些什么呢？”
- en: Then 1.0 shipped, the device was in stores, and the machine started up again.
    The team got back to working hard and cranking more releases out. For one thing,
    there was constant pressure of delivering each release in time for partner hardware
    launches. Also, there was a team-wide desire to make Android successful. Although
    you could squint and see shades of things to come, that first product was not
    game-changing. It was a decent smartphone, but not enough to really capture the
    world’s attention. So the team kept running, because they had a long way to go
    to make Android realize its potential.

  zh: 然后 1.0 发布了，设备进入了商店，机器重新启动了。团队又回到了辛勤工作中，开始推出更多版本。因为有一个持续的压力：每个版本都必须按时交付以配合合作伙伴的硬件发布。此外，团队有一个共同的愿望，那就是让
    Android 成功。虽然你可以眯着眼睛看到未来的影子，但那款初代产品并没有改变游戏规则。它是一个还不错的智能手机，但不足以真正吸引世界的注意力。所以团队继续努力，因为他们知道，Android
    要实现其潜力，还有很长的路要走。

<div class="imagec"><img alt="image" src="graphics/common01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Which shirt should I wear? What should I have for dinner? Where should I go? Should I wear my pants so low that my underwear shows? You ask yourself questions like these and answer them every day. Just as you make decisions, your programs can too! Of course, they won’t do this on their own. Your programs only make the comparisons you want them to make, and then they either run some statements or skip them. In this chapter, you’ll write programs that can make decisions.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The programs you’ve written so far followed a simple path where the statements execute from top to bottom. But sometimes you might need to run some statements if a condition’s true or other statements if a condition’s false. This is similar to how you make decisions in your life. For example, you might say, “If there’s snow, then I’ll go skiing” or “If I finish my work before 4:00 <small>PM</small>, I’ll go to the movies; otherwise, I’ll just go to Steve’s house.” In both cases, the action you take depends on a <em>condition</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_98"/>Small Basic uses a few different ways to control which statements run in a program: selection statements (<span class="literal">If</span>, <span class="literal">If/Else</span>, <span class="literal">If/ElseIf</span>), jump statements (<span class="literal">Goto</span>), and iteration or loop statements (<span class="literal">For</span> and <span class="literal">While</span>). In this chapter and the next, we’ll explain selection and jump statements, and we’ll explain loops in <a href="ch13.html#ch13">Chapters 13</a> and <a href="ch14.html#ch14">14</a>. In this chapter, you’ll learn about relational operators, Boolean expressions, and how you can use <span class="literal">If/Else</span> statements to write some interesting programs.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch08lev1sec01"><span class="blue"><strong>The If Statement</strong></span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Suppose your mom calls and tells you, “On your way home, stop at Captain Snarf’s Pizza. If it’s open, get us a large pizza.” Her instructions don’t say what to do if the pizza place is closed; you assume that you’ll just go home empty-handed. <a href="ch08.html#ch8ex1">Listing 8-1</a> represents this situation in code.</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">1 <span class="green"><span class="codeitalic">' SnarfPizza.sb</span></span><br/>2 <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.WriteLine(</span><span class="red">"Is Snarf's Pizza open?"</span><span class="brown">)</span><br/>3 <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.Write(</span><span class="red">"Enter 1 (for open) or 2 (for closed): "</span><span class="brown">)</span><br/>4 status <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.ReadNumber()</span><br/>5<br/>6 <span class="purple"><span class="codestrong">If</span></span> <span class="brown">(</span>status <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="red">1</span><span class="brown">)</span> <span class="purple"><span class="codestrong">Then</span></span><br/>7   <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.WriteLine(</span><span class="red">"You bought a delicious pizza!"</span><span class="brown">)</span><br/>8 <span class="purple"><span class="codestrong">EndIf</span></span><br/>9 <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.WriteLine(</span><span class="red">"Time to go home!"</span><span class="brown">)</span></p>&#13;

<p class="indent">Run this program and enter <span class="literal"><span class="codestrong">1</span></span> in response to the prompt (to indicate that Snarf’s is open). Because the condition on line 6 is true, the program displays the message on line 7, which is <span class="literal">"You bought a delicious pizza!"</span> The statement on line 9 (which comes after the <span class="literal">EndIf</span> keyword) runs whether you buy a pizza or not. Run this code again, but this time enter <span class="literal"><span class="codestrong">2</span></span> in response to the prompt. What happens?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The statement on line 6 is an <span class="literal">If</span> statement. The part of the statement after the <span class="literal">If</span> keyword (<span class="literal">status = 1</span>) is the <em>condition</em>. The program checks to see whether the condition is true. In this case, it checks whether Captain Snarf’s Pizza is open. The code between the <span class="literal">Then</span> and the <span class="literal">EndIf</span> keywords is the <em>action</em>—what the program does. The program does the action only if the condition’s true. Programmers usually use the term <em>code block</em> to refer to the statements between the <span class="literal">If</span> and the <span class="literal">EndIf</span> keywords (between lines 6 and 8).</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><span class="notes"><strong>NOTE</strong></span></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>Small Basic doesn’t require you to place parentheses around conditional expressions, meaning you can write the statement on line 6 like this:</em> <span class="literal"><span class="codeitalic">If status = 1 Then</span></span><em>. But parentheses make the statement easier to read, so we’ll use them in this book.</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_99"/>Small Basic automatically indents <span class="literal">If</span> statements as you type the code. This makes the program easier to read and clearly shows when statements are part of code blocks. If your code ever gets unindented, right-click in the Editor and select <strong>Format Program</strong> from the pop-up menu to indent all your code. Awesome!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The <span class="literal">If</span> statement is the basis of all decision making in Small Basic. Check out the illustration in <a href="ch08.html#ch8fig1">Figure 8-1</a> to understand how it works.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The condition of an <span class="literal">If</span> statement is a <em>logical expression</em> (also called a <em>Boolean expression</em> or a <em>conditional expression</em>) that’s either true or false. If the condition is true, the program runs the statements between the <span class="literal">If</span> and <span class="literal">EndIf</span> keywords (which is called the <em>body</em> of the <span class="literal">If</span> statement). But if the condition is false, the statements in the block are skipped. The program runs the statement after the <span class="literal">EndIf</span> keyword whether the condition is true or not.</p>&#13;

<p class="sidebart1" id="ch08sb01"><strong>BOOLEANS IN THE REAL WORLD</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The word Boolean is used in honor of George Boole, a 19th-century British mathematician who invented a system of logic based on just two values: 1 and 0 (or true and false). Boolean algebra eventually became the basis for modern-day computer science.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In real life, we use Boolean expressions all the time to make decisions. Computers also use them to determine which branch of a program to follow. A remote server may grant or deny access when you swipe your credit card at a department store based on whether your card was valid (true) or invalid (false). A computer in a vehicle will automatically deploy the airbags when it decides that a collision has occurred (<span class="literal">collision = true</span>). Your cell phone may display a warning icon when the battery is low (<span class="literal">batteryLow = true</span>) and remove the icon when the battery’s charge is acceptable (<span class="literal">batteryLow = false</span>).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">These are just few examples of how computers cause different actions to be taken by checking the results of Boolean conditions.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_100"/>You can test all sorts of conditions using relational operators, which we’ll discuss next.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec01"><em><strong>Relational Operators</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The condition (<span class="literal">status = 1</span>) in <a href="ch08.html#ch8ex1">Listing 8-1</a> tests whether the variable <span class="literal">status</span> is equal to 1. We call the equal sign here a <em>relational operator</em> (or a <em>comparison operator</em>) because it tests the relationship between two values (or expressions). Small Basic supports five other relational operators that you can use in conditions. <a href="ch08.html#ch8table1">Table 8-1</a> shows you these relational operators.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">Let’s look at a couple of short examples to see how these operators work. A lot of people want to be on Dancing with the Stars. You are hired to write an application form that potential dancers will fill out. One of the requirements is that the applicant must be at least 18 years old. How would you check this condition in your program?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Well, that’s easy. You can write something like this:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.Write(</span><span class="red">"How old are you? "</span><span class="brown">)</span><br/>age <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.ReadNumber()</span><br/><br/><span class="purple"><span class="codestrong">If</span></span> <span class="brown">(</span>age <span class="brown">&lt;</span> <span class="red">18</span><span class="brown">)</span> <span class="purple"><span class="codestrong">Then</span></span><br/>  <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.WriteLine(</span><span class="red">"Sorry! You're not old enough!"</span><span class="brown">)</span><br/><span class="purple"><span class="codestrong">EndIf</span></span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The <span class="literal">If</span> condition checks whether <span class="literal">age</span> is less than 18. If it is, the applicant isn’t old enough, and their dream to dance with the stars is over. Nice try, tiny dancer!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Another way to check the applicant’s age is like this:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="purple"><span class="codestrong">If</span></span> <span class="brown">(</span>age <span class="brown">&gt;=</span> <span class="red">18</span><span class="brown">)</span> <span class="purple"><span class="codestrong">Then</span></span><br/>  <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.WriteLine(</span><span class="red">"So far so good. You may have a chance!"</span><span class="brown">)</span><br/><span class="purple"><span class="codestrong">EndIf</span></span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The <span class="literal">If</span> condition checks whether <span class="literal">age</span> is greater than or equal to 18. If it’s true, the applicant passes this condition and still has a chance to dance with the stars.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_101"/>But what if the applicant also needs to have exactly 9 years of dancing experience? (Don’t ask why!) You can write something like this:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.Write(</span><span class="red">"How many years of dancing experience do you have? "</span><span class="brown">)</span><br/>experience <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.ReadNumber()</span><br/><span class="purple"><span class="codestrong">If</span></span> <span class="brown">(</span>experience <span class="brown">&lt;&gt;</span> <span class="red">9</span><span class="brown">)</span> <span class="purple"><span class="codestrong">Then</span></span><br/>  <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.WriteLine(</span><span class="red">"Sorry! You don't have the required experience."</span><span class="brown">)</span><br/><span class="purple"><span class="codestrong">EndIf</span></span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Note that the <span class="literal">If</span> condition uses the not equal (<span class="literal">&lt;&gt;</span>) operator. If an applicant enters any number other than 9, it’s game over for that dancer!</p>&#13;

<p class="sidebart" id="ch08sb02"><strong>TRY IT OUT 8-1</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Santa wants to deliver presents more efficiently. Instead of crawling down chimneys, he’ll drop the presents down the chimneys from his sleigh. He needs a program that inputs the sleigh’s current height (in meters) and then computes the time it takes (in seconds) for a present to fall to the chimney. Here is the formula:</p>&#13;
<div class="image2"><img alt="image" src="graphics/f0101-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">The program must check that the height Santa enters is a positive number before computing the time. Run the following program two times. Enter a positive height in the first run and a negative height in the second. Explain what happens in each case.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec02"><em><strong>Complex If Conditions</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Like arithmetic operators, relational operators also need two operands, one on each side. These operands can be simple, using variables and constants, or they can be complicated math expressions. For example, if you want to check that you have enough money to buy two large pizzas and pay a $5 tip, enter this:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="purple"><span class="codestrong">If</span></span> <span class="brown">(</span>myMoney <span class="brown">&gt;= (</span><span class="red">2</span> <span class="brown">*</span> pizzaPrice <span class="brown">+</span> <span class="red">5</span><span class="brown">))</span> <span class="purple"><span class="codestrong">Then</span></span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_102"/>Small Basic first finds the value of <span class="literal">2 * pizzaPrice + 5</span> (using the current value of <span class="literal">pizzaPrice</span>). It then compares the result with the current value of <span class="literal">myMoney</span> to see whether the <span class="literal">If</span> condition is true or false.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can also use any method that returns a value inside the <span class="literal">If</span> condition. For example, if you create a pizza delivery video game and want to give the player an extra life when their score gets to 100, 200, 300, and so on, you can enter this:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="purple"><span class="codestrong">If</span></span> <span class="brown">(</span><span class="blue1">Math</span><span class="brown">.Remainder(</span>score<span class="brown">,</span> <span class="red">100</span><span class="brown">) =</span> <span class="red">0</span><span class="brown">)</span> <span class="purple"><span class="codestrong">Then</span></span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This condition checks the remainder of the current score, <span class="literal">score</span>, divided by 100. If the remainder is 0, the <span class="literal">If</span> condition is true and the player gets the extra life they earned.</p>&#13;
<div class="sidebar">&#13;

<h4 class="h4" id="ch08lev2sec03"><em><strong>Comparing Strings</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">We just showed you how to use relational operators to compare numbers, but in some applications you’ll need to compare strings.

<p class="indent">You can use the <span class="literal">=</span> (equal) or <span class="literal">&lt;&gt;</span> (not equal) operators to test whether two strings are identical. <a href="ch08.html#ch8ex2">Listing 8-2</a> asks the user to guess the secret passcode.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="ch08lev1sec03"><span class="blue"><strong>Nested If and If/Else Statements</strong></span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The statements you write in the body of an <span class="literal">If</span> (or <span class="literal">Else</span>) block can be any kind of Small Basic statement, including another <span class="literal">If</span> or <span class="literal">If/Else</span> statement. Writing an <span class="literal">If</span> (or <span class="literal">If/Else</span>) statement inside another one creates a <em>nested</em> <span class="literal"><span class="codeitalic">If</span></span> <em>statement</em> (see <a href="ch08.html#ch8fig3">Figure 8-3</a>). The inner <span class="literal">If</span> statement can also include other <span class="literal">If</span> or <span class="literal">If/Else</span> statements, and the nesting can continue to any level you want. But be careful not to nest down too many levels, or you’ll get lost in all the levels and might feel like Super Mario falling down an endless pit!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can use nested <span class="literal">If</span> statements when you need to perform multiple checks on the same variable or when you need to test multiple conditions. Let’s look at an example that uses a nested <span class="literal">If/Else</span> block to test multiple conditions.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">The statement in line 2 is called a <em>label</em>; it’s used to identify a specific line of the program. Labels end with a colon, and you can place them anywhere in a program.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This program then runs lines 3–7. When it reaches line 8, it returns to line 2 (to the <span class="literal">Again</span> label), and Small Basic runs lines 3–7 again. A <em>loop</em> is when you run the same block of code more than once, and this loop goes on forever (like <em>The Song That Never Ends</em> and the Barney song). Run this program to see its output (and try to get those songs out of your head; mwahaha).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The <span class="literal">Goto</span> statement is an <em>unconditional jump</em> (or <em>unconditional transfer</em>) statement, because the program jumps unconditionally (without asking any questions) to the location given by the <span class="literal">Goto</span>’s label. The <span class="literal">If/Then</span> statement, on the other hand, is a <em>conditional transfer</em> statement, because the program changes its normal flow only when a certain condition is met.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Most programmers suggest that you don’t use <span class="literal">Goto</span> statements because they can turn a program into <em>spaghetti code</em>—code that is so tangled and complex that no one can follow it! But sometimes a <span class="literal">Goto</span> statement can be very useful, and it’s helpful to know when it might come in handy.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">One common use of <span class="literal">Goto</span> is to check the data entered by a user to make sure it’s correct, as shown in <a href="ch08.html#ch8ex7">Listing 8-7</a>.</p>&#13;

			<p class="ChapterIntro">In the words of Sun Tzu, the greatest victories are the ones that require no battle; or, to put it differently, the objective of most warfare isn’t to destroy the enemy, but to frighten them into submitting to one’s demands.</p>
			<p>
				This may seem like an oddly militaristic introduction to self-defense, but what’s true for large armies also holds true for individuals. Very few people who threaten to harm others actually have violence as their goal; it’s a means to an end, and given the inherent risks of combat, it’s one they’d often rather <em>not</em> exercise. If a mugger or a home invader brings a weapon with them, it’s almost always just to make the victims turn over their belongings without too much of a fuss. It follows that to turn the tables on an assailant, the victim usually doesn’t need to resort to lethal force. Displaying a reciprocal ability to cause serious harm can be enough. This demonstration can be purely visual too; for example, seeing the muzzle of a gun or the blade of a kitchen knife is sufficient to make most burglars reconsider their plans.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_204" title="204"/>This should be a comforting thought to those of a pacifist demeanor: defending yourself doesn’t necessarily mean engaging in a deadly fight, and choosing to arm yourself doesn’t need to be driven by a dark urge to kill. It’s just that sometimes, the surest way to avoid violence is to make it clear that you mean business and aren’t going to be an easy mark.</p>
			<p>However, the threat of force is always an escalation—and if the assailant calls your bluff, the situation can quickly take a turn for the worse. As such, when you signal the willingness to cause harm in self-defense, even if just to dissuade a potential attack, you should carefully evaluate the odds and be ready to follow through—and ideally, know how to do so within the bounds of the law.</p>
			<p>
				Of course, no amount of diligent reading is going to prepare a person for a showdown in a dimly lit parking lot. That said, my hope is that the overview of self-defense tools in this and the following chapter will help you figure out what skills to practice or which classes to take.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c26-footnote-1" id="c26-footnoteref-1">* </a></sup></p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c26-0001">The Legalities of Self-Defense</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">In most situations, it’s unlawful to use force, or credibly threaten to use force, to harm another person. That said, legal systems around the world recognize that the defense of life and limb is a valid excuse for taking many actions that would otherwise violate the law, possibly all the way to homicide.</p>
			<p>
				At the same time, in most jurisdictions, several fairly specific conditions must be met in order for such a legal excuse to succeed. The first nearly universal requirement is <em>innocence.</em> The situation that led to the use of force must not be a consequence of your own unlawful or reckless behavior—say, deliberately starting a fight. Of course, this rule is applied with considerable nuance. For example, in some places, if you try to disengage and walk away from a brawl of your doing, those pursuing you may now be in the wrong, and you might be able to lawfully fend them off. Still, it’s best not to put yourself in situations where your freedom would hinge on finer legal points of this sort.</p>
			<p>
				The second component of lawful self-defense is a rational fear of <em>imminent harm</em>. You must reasonably believe that there’s an immediate and serious risk of injury or death. In many jurisdictions, especially in the United States, you don’t need to be objectively right. If you mistook a toy pistol for a real gun, for example, you might still be cleared in court. On the other hand, you can’t beat up another person just because they voiced a vague threat (“I’ll kill you!”) but didn’t start making good on that plan.</p>
			<p>
				The third prong present in most legal systems is <em>proportionality.</em> Your actions must be commensurate with the severity of the threat and must <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_205" title="205"/>cease once the immediate danger ends. A grown man can’t viciously beat a small child; a fleeing robber typically can’t be shot in the back. Beyond such egregious examples, in the United States, this rule is usually applied in a fairly relaxed fashion, recognizing that not every decision is perfectly measured in the heat of the moment. As a morbid example, few people get in trouble for emptying half a magazine into an armed felon, even if a single shot might have theoretically stopped the threat. In countries with a dimmer view of self-defense, such as the United Kingdom, proportionality is often dissected with much greater zeal.</p>
			<p>
				The final element, found only in some judicial systems, is the <em>duty to retreat.</em> The law may compel the victim to try to get away from the assailant, allowing the use of force only if there’s no safe way to escape. In the United States, such laws are fairly rare. As far as I can tell, no state requires you to run away from your own home, but a limited duty to retreat in other situations is present in several states in the Northeast, plus in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Hawaii.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c26-0002">The Right to Arm Yourself</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">While the legal right to defend yourself appears to be universally recognized, the right to posses or carry weapons is a wholly different animal, with drastic differences in various parts of the world. On one end of the spectrum, some governments take the position that the desire to fight off potential attacks isn’t a legitimate reason to possess <em>any</em> dangerous tools, even as benign as pepper spray.</p>
			<p>
				As an illustrative example, in a FAQ published by a police organization in the United Kingdom, readers are advised that “the only fully legal self-defence product at the moment is a rape alarm” and that it would be illegal to possess “a product made or adapted to cause a person injury” in public—or even privately in some circumstances.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c26-endnote-1" id="c26-noteref-1">1</a></sup> The government’s intention is to reduce the number of drunken brawls or other confrontations that end in severe injury. Yet it must be noted that without access to any equalizing defensive tools such as pepper spray, the law of the street is that <em>might is right</em>: a pack of athletic males may terrorize frailer citizens with relatively few worries in mind.</p>
			<p>
				In the United States, the possession of self-defense tools is tolerated better, although local laws provide plenty of gotchas and little rhyme or reason. Pepper spray appears to be allowed everywhere and subject to few practical restrictions. Stun guns, on the other hand, require firearm licenses in Massachusetts and Illinois. As hinted in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 20">Chapter 20</span>, knife carry laws are typically permissive, but a mess of obscure municipal and state rules restrict specific blade shapes, opening mechanisms, and so forth. The American Knife &amp; Tool Institute maintains a good catalog of the rules at <em>https://www.akti.org/state-knife-laws/</em>. It gets even more confusing when it comes to exotic arms. In California and Massachusetts, for example, the possession of nunchucks may land you in jail, but carrying a medieval maul appears to be okay.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_206" title="206"/>When it comes to the right to carry firearms, the United States is rather unique. As of this writing, the vast majority of US states and counties either practice <em>constitutional carry </em>(allowing most individuals to carry a concealed or openly displayed gun without needing any kind of government-issued permit) or have permitting regimes that are by law or in practice <em>shall issue</em> (permits are swiftly granted to any unprohibited person who bothers to ask).</p>
			<p>
				At the same time, some of the country’s most populous regions, especially on the coasts, effectively adopt <em>no issue</em> policies: the local government maintains the pretense of having an application process, but the process is designed so that no ordinary citizen can ever meet the bar. Miraculously, prominent campaign donors and minor government dignitaries tend to qualify with more ease; pay-to-play permit issuance scandals have rocked the San Francisco Bay Area,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c26-endnote-2" id="c26-noteref-2">2</a></sup> New York City,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c26-endnote-3" id="c26-noteref-3">3</a></sup> and other gun control strongholds around the country.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c26-0003">The Merits of Unarmed Combat</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">In places where the government looks dimly at the possession of self-defense tools, the practice of martial arts has undeniable merit. A proficiency in hand-to-hand combat techniques offers other perks too: unlike a knife or a can of pepper spray, the muscle memory to take on assailants can be brought with you on a plane and will follow you even when you must go through metal detectors and walk past “no weapons” signs.</p>
			<p>That said, martial arts techniques can be difficult to master. Many dabble, but most lack the multiyear commitment to truly hone their skills. It’s also important to be realistic about what martial arts can and cannot do. Real life isn’t an action film, and if the assailant is armed, all someone might be doing with their impressive karate moves is bringing fists to a knife fight.</p>
			<p>Just as important, a fighting stance and a battle cry may have no practical deterrent effect coming from a petite woman or a nerdy dude with pool noodles for arms, even if they’re incredibly skilled. The assailant might not be inclined to back off until the fight starts and they realize they’re facing a pro. This may sound like an acceptable trade-off, except the outcome of a fight is never certain. The attacker may turn out to be quite skilled too and able to land some good blows, or perhaps they’re clutching a knife just out of sight.</p>
			<p>For all these reasons, I advise caution. Martial arts are a meritorious and rewarding pursuit, but they might not be the simplest, the safest, nor the most dependable way to get out of trouble. They can augment your strategy but probably shouldn’t be the only trick up your sleeve. For those interested in pursuing hand-to-hand combat, I recommend pragmatic fighting schools over the ones designed for spectating or self-discovery; Krav Maga is perhaps the best-known utilitarian pick.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c26-0004">Less-Lethal Defense Tools</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">In situations where defensive weapons are permissible, there are clear merits to implements that are designed to repel or immobilize assailants, rather <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_207" title="207"/>than cause them grievous harm. For one, such equipment may be safer to hand over to inexperienced users, including teenage kids. The rules for the purchase or possession of such tools may be considerably less stringent as well. Last but not least, although the legal bar for the use of force may not be very different for lethal and less-lethal weapons, the practical consequences of wrongfully shooting someone are far more serious than the consequences of making their eyes itch.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c26-footnote-2" id="c26-footnoteref-2">*</a></sup></p>
			<p>On the note of itchy eyes, pepper spray is by far the most versatile and dependable less-lethal defense tool out there. It’s inexpensive, compact, easy to use, and difficult to resist. Just as important, a single can is enough to hit multiple targets from a reasonably safe distance of about 10 feet. The final perk is that the spray also works against aggressive dogs and many other animals. About the only drawback is that the weapon becomes less effective in strong wind, with some risk of blowback toward the user or innocent bystanders. This problem is less pronounced with gel-based products that expel a narrow stream of liquid rather than a cloud.</p>
			<p>The other well-known self-defense tool in this category, a stun gun, is a misnomer. It’s not a gun, and it doesn’t knock people out. It can be thought of as a pain compliance device, much like a cattle prod. When pressed against the body of the assailant, it causes an intensely unpleasant sensation. Although the current does cause some muscle contraction, almost as soon as the contact is broken, the perp is back in the game, hopefully less enthused about continuing the assault.</p>
			<p>Because of the need to get up close, the inability to take on multiple assailants in rapid succession, and the possibility of clothing getting in the way, stun guns seem to me as vastly inferior to pepper spray. An exception can be made for actual gun-like devices, such as the Taser pistols used by the police and sometimes available to civilians. These weapons expel barb-like electrodes and long wires to deliver a continuous shock to subjects 15 feet away or more. But Tasers are rather expensive and bulky—and you get only one or two chances to hit the attacker before needing to reload.</p>
			<p>Many other less-lethal defense options are promoted on the internet, but I’ve yet to find one that deserves a serious note. In the United States, you can buy plastic “firearms” that expel bits of rock salt or paintballs filled with pepper gel, supposedly with unpleasant effects if you manage to hit a delicate part. More seriously but less conveniently, a regular pump-action shotgun can be loaded with riot-control rubber slugs or bean bags. The impact is incredibly painful—but it’s strictly a home defense weapon, not a gadget to carry around town.</p>
			<p>
				In the parts of Europe where real firearms and many other self-defense tools are verboten, air rifles capable of firing tiny skin-piercing metal pellets seem to be the less-lethal weapon of choice. To me, that’s an unconvincing approach. Getting hit by a pellet is unpleasant and occasionally dangerous, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_208" title="208"/>but in most cases, it serves to anger the assailant, not stop them in their tracks.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c26-footnote-3" id="c26-footnoteref-3">*</a></sup> In the same vein, a bizarre but persistent myth claims that wasp spray works as a stand-in for pepper spray. Any homeowner who has experienced blowback while trying to eradicate a nest will know that the spray is oily and a tad smelly, but that’s where the unpleasant effects end (that is, unless you’re a wasp).</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c26-0005">Weapons That Kill</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Deadly weapons serve two functions. The more obvious and definite one is to injure an assailant to the point where the attack stops. But a more common function, as discussed earlier, is to warn the aggressor of the terrible consequences that await if they don’t surrender or withdraw. From that perspective, appearances matter: a machete says you mean business far more loudly than a kitchen knife can.</p>
			<p>Knives, for all their reputation, don’t actually make for a particularly good defense tool. Their sinister rep is more deserved on the offense, especially when the victim isn’t expecting an attack. But in defensive situations, much like stun guns, they require close bodily contact, along with good reflexes, to cause serious harm. The consequences of a knife injury aren’t instantaneous, either—so even if you mortally wound an armed assailant, you might still get stabbed or shot. Because of this, the longer, the better: anything that builds the distance between you and the attacker is a plus. In a desperate home defense situation, I’d much rather be clumsily swinging a sharp sword than expertly manipulating a paring knife.</p>
			<p>Blunt instruments, from baseball bats to iron pipes, make for another popular home defense pick. They’re especially fashionable in some of the more restrictive parts of Europe, kept with the hope of telling the authorities that you’re just an avid amateur plumber or a big fan of baseball. The problem with blunt instruments is mostly that they’re only as menacing as the person wielding them. Another drawback is that lacking a sharp blade, a pipe or a bat can be easily grabbed and possibly wrestled away. Solutions to this problem have been proposed, such as putting a sock or a stocking over the implement—but I’d wager that the real-world efficacy of this life hack isn’t what it’s cracked up to be.</p>
			<p>
				The next popular defense tools are old-fashioned ranged weapons: crossbows and bows. A bow takes skill to load and aim, but a crossbow has a point-and-click interface not very different from a gun. Both weapons are deadly, especially when equipped with broadhead arrows or bolts meant for hunting. That said, the main problem with these weapons is that they’re incredibly clunky. If you hear knocking on the door at 11 <span class="KeyCaps">PM</span>, it may be weird to greet a neighbor or a police officer while holding a cocked <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_209" title="209"/>crossbow in your hand. Another problem is the abysmal rate of fire. If you miss your first shot, or if you’re dealing with multiple assailants, you’re hopelessly exposed for the four to eight seconds it takes to reload.</p>
			<p>
				This brings us to more modern ranged weapons: firearms. Although not as lethal as commonly imagined (for handguns, only about 20 percent of gunshot injuries treated in hospitals end in death),<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c26-endnote-4" id="c26-noteref-4">4</a></sup> firearms are perceived as far more intimidating than machetes, baseball bats, crossbows, and the like. For this reason, they’re remarkably good at resolving conflicts without having to fire a single shot. Just as interestingly, when a shot must be fired, most assailants are stopped in their tracks even if the injury isn’t immediately disabling or life-threatening. The effect may be at least partly psychological. Heavy intoxication or unusual agitation can blunt this instinct and cause assailants to keep coming at the victim despite being shot multiple times.</p>
			<p>Of course, access to firearms is heavily regulated in much of the world. That said, even in regions customarily painted with a single brush, the permitting regimes vary quite significantly. For example, Finland, Switzerland, and Germany enjoy surprisingly high firearm-ownership rates compared to many of their neighbors. Still, the United States is unique in its recognition of the right for individuals to own firearms without the need to give a reason or otherwise actively qualify.</p>
			<p>No matter where you live, for those who can and wish to consider a firearm in their preparedness strategy, we’ll have a look at some of the options—and the essential safety considerations—in the next and final chapter of the book.</p>

				<p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c26-footnoteref-2" id="c26-footnote-2">*</a></sup> At least for the most part. Although weapons such as pepper spray and stun guns are thought of as nonlethal, <em>less-lethal</em> is a more accurate term. There’s still some risk if the tool is used improperly, if the targeted person has a serious medical condition, or if they simply trip and suffer a fall injury.</p>

The lightweight pellets weigh a fraction of a gram and measure about 0.18 inches in diameter; while they can pierce the skin, they usually don’t travel very far.</p>

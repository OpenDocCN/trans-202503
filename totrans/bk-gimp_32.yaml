    is that you must look at the screen while signing. Essentially, you’re signing
    on the screen with the stylus. Fortunately, it gets easier with practice. (To
    practice, try using the stylus as the controller for a video game.)'

    skip it, edge detection generates an angular pattern. You could try using artistic
    filters other than Oilify and Cubism in GIMPressionist. For example, you could
    replace IWarp with another distort filter, such as Waves, to create a pattern
    with strong central symmetry that disappears if you then apply a filter like Cubism.'

    This tutorial uses an old version of GIMP, but adapting the instructions for later
    versions is not difficult.'

- en: '**Exercise 4.7** The image generated by the script contains three layers above
    a white background. The logo is on the top layer, the shadow is on the second
    layer, and the reflection is on the third layer. This third layer also contains
    a layer mask with a horizontal gradient, which is used to make the reflection
    paler. To create the shadow, use the technique described in [Proper Shade vs.
    Cast Shadow](ch04s03.html#proper_shade_vsdot_cast_shadow "Proper Shade vs. Cast
    Shadow"). To create the reflection, simply flip a copy of the logo horizontally
    and move it into place. The relief on the logo itself can be added by using a
    combination of the Emboss and Bump Map filters.'

    As you can see on the right, however, the tool doesn’t work so well due to the
    flower pot. To address this issue, leave out the pot or use the Quick Mask.'

    often get interesting results by choosing a short subrange to produce something
    similar to an inverted etching.'

    case. The simplest solution here is to select **Image: Colors > Desaturate** and

    each color stripe by hand, using the Fuzzy Select tool to select exactly one stripe
    and using the **Image: Colors > Hue-Saturation** tool to change the color of the

    the ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1453922.png.jpg) key to draw straight
    lines. Add the text on as many new layers as necessary.'

    the Ellipse Select tool, and press ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1453922.png.jpg)
    and ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1453844.png.jpg) after the initial
    click on the circle’s center. (Save this selection as a channel in case you lose
    it.) Create a transparent layer, and fill the selection with pure red. Then create
    another transparent layer, move the circular selection, and fill it with pure
    green. Do the same with a third layer but fill it with pure blue. Now set the
    three layers with colored circles in Addition mode and move them until you are
    satisfied. This process builds [Figure A-36](apas03.html#additive_model-id00209

    for the layer background and create the other layers in Multiply mode.'

    Even before the advent of modern municipal engineering, many civilizations had
    developed strategies for delivering fresh water to urban areas and removing wastewater
    to prevent it from contaminating water sources. In the 19th century, as cities
    worldwide began to grow in population and density, the threat to public health
    from waterborne diseases became more menacing and insidious. The science of sanitation
    developed as a necessity to keep city-dwellers safe from plague and pestilence.
    Now nearly all cities and towns have complex systems for delivering abundant and
    clean water to their citizens and disposing of sewage. Although easy to take for
    granted, the development and maintenance of municipal water and wastewater systems
    are massive undertakings, requiring a lot of infrastructure. Much of the pipes
    and valves in cities are buried below the ground, but you can observe many facilities
    and equipment if you know where to look.

- en: Much of the water we rely on for drinking, cleaning, and irrigation of crops
    starts its journey in a river, stream, creek, lake, or reservoir. These sources
    are collectively known as *surface waters* (as opposed to groundwater resources,
    which are discussed in the next section). Collecting water from a river or lake
    might seem straightforward; however, many engineering challenges are associated
    with transitioning the flow from a surface water source into a pipeline or *aqueduct*
    to be delivered to its destination. *Intake structures* perform this critical
    task. They can be associated with an impoundment or diversion (for example, at
    a dam), but intakes are often standalone structures, and you’ll see them near
    riverbanks, lakes, or reservoirs if you keep an eye out.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lake or reservoir intakes often consist of large concrete or masonry towers
    (as discussed in Chapter 6). Complicating matters, a structure considered an *outlet*
    at a dam might also serve as an *intake* for a pumping station or aqueduct. Older
    structures called crib intakes were  constructed onshore, floated into place,
    and then filled with rubble. A central shaft carries water by gravity through
    the intake to a tunnel below the lake where it can be pumped to treatment and
    distribution facilities on the shore.

- en: Although complete removal of contaminants and sediment is usually performed
    later, the engineering of intakes includes making sure that the source water entering
    a pipe is as clean as possible to reduce the burden on downstream water treatment
    plants. This untreated water is often known as *raw water*. In reservoirs and
    lakes, the volume of suspended sediments, the quantity of microorganisms like
    plankton and algae, and even the temperature of the water can vary significantly
    with depth. Thus, most intake structures on lakes and reservoirs have openings
    (or *ports*) at multiple levels so that operators can select the ideal mixture
    of water from the depths within the lake or reservoir. Gates on the various openings
    can be opened or closed depending on the conditions within the source water and
    the needs downstream.

- en: Intakes on rivers contend with a different set of challenges. First, the level
    in a river can vary significantly. In addition, river intakes must contend with
    the fact that streams are dynamic systems. Floods can move massive quantities
    of sediment, changing the location and shape of banks and even altering the course
    of a river altogether. River intakes are almost always located either on a straight
    section of the channel or on the outside of a bend. Sediment tends to deposit
    on the inside of curves where flows are slower, so engineers avoid those locations
    where an intake could be clogged more readily. Bank intakes are installed on a
    riverbank to allow water to flow laterally into the structure. However, the deepest
    part of a natural channel (called the *thalweg*) is often in the center, so bank
    intakes often require dredging of the riverbed to allow water to flow when the
    river level is low. This dredging is not only disruptive to the sensitive environment
    of a river, but it must be performed regularly as sediments in the river deposit
    over time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One solution to the challenges of varying water levels and sediment buildup
    is constructing a small *weir* downstream. Such a structure raises the water level
    in the river while also slowing down the flow so that sediment can settle out.
    However, weirs create an impediment to navigation and migratory wildlife, and
    they can be quite dangerous (as discussed in Chapter 6), so their use has fallen
    out of favor. Modern intake structures on rivers make use of careful siting to
    avoid problems with sedimentation and lower water levels while minimizing environmental
    impacts. One alternative to bank intakes involves running a conduit from a deeper
    section of the channel to the shore, often performed using tunneling to avoid
    the need for trenching in the natural riverbank. A screen on the end of the conduit
    prevents fish or debris from entering the line, and a gate controls the flow.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unless the final destination of the raw water is well below the source, most
    intakes will be accompanied by a *pumping station*, which lifts the water from
    its source into a pipeline or aqueduct. Pumps are often installed directly above
    or adjacent to the intake structure, sometimes within a building called a pump
    house. These structures may be recognizable by built-in gantry cranes that allow
    equipment to be serviced or replaced when needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At a pumping station, water flows into ports, through a conduit or tunnel, then
    into a structure called a *sump* (or wet well), which creates enough volume and
    depth for pumps to operate. Sumps must be designed to create ideal flow conditions
    to avoid inefficiencies and damage to the pump. Turbulent and swirling flow in
    a sump can lead to a *vortex,* just like what happens when you drain a bathtub.
    If a vortex is allowed to enter the mouth of the pump column, the air will reduce
    its efficiency and may even cause it to fail. Vortex breakers are sometimes installed
    within sumps to keep the flow from swirling as it is drawn into the pump.

- en: Intakes can represent a severe hazard to swimmers and boaters in rivers and
    lakes because of the submerged structures and fast-flowing water. Where public
    safety may be at risk, owners of intakes often install floating booms to warn
    people of the potential danger. These booms consist of brightly colored floating
    elements linked together with chains. They are anchored to the river or lakebed
    to create an exclusion zone around a dangerous structure. Some booms are even
    designed to be strong enough to hold back debris, floating trees, and ice that
    could damage intake structures. In addition, when an intake or pumping station
    must be located near the bank, armoring (such as *rock riprap*) is usually installed
    to protect against erosion that could threaten the structure.

    seeps down into the ground through the spaces between soil and rock particles.
    Sometimes this groundwater reaches a less permeable geologic layer (called an
    aquitard) and cannot continue downward. Over long periods of time, infiltrating
    water can accumulate into vast underground resources called aquifers. A common
    misconception is that groundwater is stored in open areas like underground rivers
    or lakes. Although they exist in some locations, large underground caverns are
    relatively rare. Nearly all groundwater aquifers are geologic formations of sand,
    gravel, or rock that are saturated with water, just like a sponge. Extracting
    this groundwater for use by humans is the job of a *well*. At their simplest,
    wells are just holes into which groundwater can seep from the surrounding soil.
    However, modern wells utilize sophisticated engineering to provide a reliable
    and long-lasting source of fresh water. Farms use them for irrigation. Rural homes
    and businesses often rely on them when a connection to a municipal distribution
    system is unavailable. And many large cities utilize groundwater as a primary
    source of fresh water for their populations.

- en: The availability of groundwater varies significantly around the world. Nearly
    all places have layers of saturated soil or rock below the ground. Still, the
    volume of water, its quality, and the ease of extracting it to the surface depend
    primarily on the local geology. Groundwater is also connected to the rest of the
    hydrologic system, so groundwater withdrawals may impact the volume and quality
    of surface water resources. Unfortunately, we can’t see below the ground, and
    methods for exploring subsurface geology mainly involve drilling *boreholes*,
    which can be quite expensive. Thus, the availability of groundwater in a specific
    area is usually determined by combining many sources of information, including
    local knowledge and the performance of nearby wells. Selecting the location and
    depth of a well is sometimes an art as much as it is a science for groundwater
    hydrologists.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A well is usually installed by boring into the subsurface with a drill rig.
    The driller takes detailed records of the excavated soil and rock (called *cuttings*)
    that can be compared to assumptions about the geology that were made during the
    well design. Once a borehole is excavated to the proper depth, the well can be
    installed. Steel or plastic pipe, called casing, is placed into the hole to provide
    support so that loose soil and rock can’t fall into the well. A screen is attached
    to the casing at the depths where water will be withdrawn. The screen allows groundwater
    to flow into the casing while keeping larger soil and rock particles out of the
    well where they could contaminate the water or cause additional wear on pumps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once the casing and screen are installed, the *annular space* (the area between
    the excavated borehole and casing) must be filled. Where the well is screened,
    this space is usually filled with gravel or coarse sand called gravel pack. This
    material acts as a filter to keep fine particles of the aquifer formation from
    entering the well through the screen. The space along unscreened casing is usually
    filled with bentonite clay, which swells to create an impermeable seal so that
    shallower groundwater (which may be lower quality) can’t travel along the annular
    space into the screens. Finally, the uppermost section of the annular space is
    permanently sealed, again using bentonite clay or sometimes using cement grout.
    This seal ensures that contaminants on the surface cannot find their way into
    the well. In a worst-case scenario, pollutants could enter a well and flow into
    the aquifer, contaminating it for other users, so most jurisdictions have strict
    rules for sealing wells at the surface. The casing is usually extended aboveground
    to create a wellhead with a concrete pad extending in all directions to prevent
    damage or infiltration to the well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The process of drilling a well can smear a layer of clay or fine particles along
    the surface of the borehole, creating an obstruction to flow. After a well is
    installed, it is usually taken through a procedure called *well development* to
    establish a hydraulic connection with the aquifer. Development involves surging
    water or air into and out of the well to remove fine sediments along the contact
    between the gravel pack and aquifer formation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A properly completed and developed well allows groundwater to flow easily and
    sediment-free from the aquifer into the casing. However, it still needs a way
    to deliver that water up to the surface. Shallow wells can use *jet pumps* that
    draw water up using suction like a straw. However, this method doesn’t work for
    deeper wells. When you drink through a straw, you create a vacuum, allowing the
    pressure of the surrounding atmosphere to push your beverage upward. However,
    only so much atmosphere is available to balance the weight of a fluid in a suction
    pipe. If you could create a complete vacuum in a straw, the highest you could
    draw a drink of water is around 10 meters or 33 feet. Thus, deeper wells cannot
    use suction to bring water to the surface. Instead, the pump must be installed
    at the bottom of the well so that it can push water to the top.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: High-capacity wells are usually equipped with *vertical turbine pumps*. An electric
    motor is mounted to the wellhead and connected to a vertical shaft running down
    through the center of a column pipe. At the bottom, the shaft drives a series
    of impellers that force water from the well up through the column pipe into the
    discharge line. Vertical turbine pumps are easy to service since the motor is
    accessible at the surface. However, they are noisy and require precise alignment
    of the well for its entire length. The popular alternative involves placing the
    motor at the bottom of the well with the impellers in a sealed assembly called
    a *submersible pump*. Submersible pumps are quieter because the moving components
    are deep below the ground, but they usually have a lower capacity since they use
    smaller motors to fit within the casing of a well.

    many populated areas don’t receive ample precipitation throughout the year. As
    a result, some of the most impressive infrastructure projects in the world have
    the simple job of delivering *raw water* from a source to a populated region where
    it can be distributed to users. The ancient Romans were famous for their aqueducts,
    which traversed many miles to carry fresh water into cities, even crossing rivers
    using elaborate stone bridges. However, the bridges were only a tiny part of each
    aqueduct system that often included miles of pipes, canals, and tunnels. Modern
    engineers use many of the same tools as the ancient Romans to move water to where
    it’s needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Terminology can vary, but the word *aqueduct* generally describes any human-made
    structure meant to deliver water across a long distance. Perhaps the most straightforward
    technique for moving water is within an open canal. If the source is high enough
    in elevation above its destination, excavating a channel is a guaranteed way to
    compel water to flow since gravity does all the work. Many aqueducts have very
    gradual slopes such that the incline is practically imperceptible to the eye.
    However, the amount of fluid that can flow by gravity is related to the channel’s
    size and slope, so a steeper canal can be smaller (and thus cheaper to build)
    while moving the same volume of water as a larger, more gradual channel.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The flow volume isn’t the only design consideration for an open channel, though.
    The flow velocity must be fast enough to minimize settling of silt on the canal
    floor but slow enough to avoid scouring and erosion. The channel also must be
    wide enough to carry sufficient flow without being so shallow as to accelerate
    the evaporation of water into the air or seepage into the soil below. Engineers
    balance these factors when selecting the route a canal will take and the shape
    of the channel along the way. For example, many aqueducts run parallel to rivers
    where the topography naturally descends over long distances, and most canals use
    a trapezoidal cross section with sloped sides that are less likely to collapse.
    In addition, many canals include a concrete lining to mitigate seepage losses
    and scour.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Open canals are usually less expensive than other options, but they are subject
    to several disadvantages, including water loss through evaporation and seepage,
    freezing conditions that can block the flow, and their vulnerability to pollution.
    Canals also have environmental impacts because they divide the landscape just
    like a road or highway. Finally, channels can flow only downhill, limiting their
    practicality in hilly terrain. In many cases, moving an aqueduct underground in
    a tunnel or pipeline makes sense.
  prefs: []

    the surface, flowing by gravity with a free surface at the top. The water is protected
    from pollution, evaporation, and seepage from the tunnel lining or pipe. Underground
    aqueducts must have a consistent slope for gravity flow, but that is easier to
    accomplish when the watercourse isn’t constrained to the Earth’s surface. Underground
    tunnels also reduce environmental issues by minimizing impacts at the surface.
    They can even travel under rivers using vertical shafts, which help form inverted
    siphons, eliminating the need for bridges.

    along the way undulates too much for gravity flow, a pressurized pipeline may
    be the only feasible way for an aqueduct to function. A pumping station at the
    intake (as discussed in the previous section) forces water into the pipeline,
    allowing it to flow against gravity. These pipes are often installed in trenches
    just far enough below the surface to protect against damage and freezing. The
    pipe is set atop a layer of bedding that acts like a mattress to distribute loads
    along the line.

    The pipe must be strong enough to withstand both the internal water pressure and
    external forces from the backfill and surface loads. Pipes must also resist corrosion
    from the water they carry inside and the soil along the outside. A pipe can be
    made from various materials, including steel, plastic, fiberglass, and concrete,
    and all materials have advantages depending on the situation. Larger pipelines
    often use protective outer coatings and inner linings to extend the lifespan of
    the line.

    pipelines are either welded at each joint or use a bell and spigot design. When
    the spigot of one pipe section slides into the bell of another, it compresses
    a rubber gasket, creating a watertight seal. A band of grout is sometimes installed
    around each joint to protect the gasket and any exposed steel from damage and
    corrosion.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Selecting the pipe size is another critical decision in the design of a pipeline.
    Smaller pipes are less expensive, but they require water to move faster to achieve
    the equivalent flow of a larger pipe. Water loses energy through friction, and
    these losses increase with velocity, so the money saved by installing a smaller
    pipe might be lost over time from the increased cost of pumping. For long pipelines,
    these frictional losses might be so significant to require booster pumps along
    the way that maintain pressure in the system. As pipes age, their inner surfaces
    get rougher, so engineers must consider the friction and pumping costs through
    the entire lifetime of the pipeline.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The mass of fluid in a long pipeline can be enormous, sometimes greater than
    a fully loaded freight train. When all that water is moving through a pipe, it
    has quite a bit of momentum. However, even though it’s a fluid, water isn’t very
    compressible, so closing a valve or stopping a pump gives that momentum nowhere
    to go. Instead, it creates a spike in pressure that travels as a shockwave through
    the pipe, an effect called *water hammer*. These shockwaves can be a problem in
    residential homes when taps close too quickly, resulting in lines knocking in
    the walls. However, in large pipelines that can contain immense volumes of fluid,
    closing a valve quickly can be the equivalent of slamming a freight train into
    a concrete wall. To avoid spikes in pressure that could damage equipment or rupture
    pipes, engineers specify slow-closing valves and pumps that start and stop gradually.
    In situations where operators need rapid control over the flow, surge tanks can
    be installed to absorb the extreme pressure spikes and minimize the damaging effects
    of water hammer.

    particles can negatively affect the water’s taste and smell. Before water can
    be distributed to homes and businesses where it may be used for drinking or cooking,
    it usually must first go through a purification process at a water treatment plant
    to be made *potable*. A wide variety of techniques are used to purify water and
    ensure that it’s safe for human consumption. Most water treatment plants are custom-designed
    for a specific water source and the potential contaminants that threaten it. For
    example, groundwater often requires less treatment than surface water sources
    because it is less vulnerable to pollution. Not every treatment plant uses the
    same set of processes, and not all parts of a water treatment plant are visible

    These solid particles give the water a murky appearance (called *turbidity*) and
    can harbor dangerous microorganisms. The first step in most treatment plants is
    to remove these suspended particles from the water in a process called *sedimentation,*
    which is often accomplished in a series of three stages. First, a chemical *coagulant*
    is vigorously mixed into the water. Coagulants neutralize the electric charges
    that cause suspended particles to repel each other, allowing them to stick together.
    Next, a chemical *flocculant* is added to the water, which bonds suspended particles
    together into groups called flocs. Flocculant is added to the raw water slowly
    to avoid breaking up the flocs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the flocs of suspended particles grow, they eventually become heavy enough
    to settle out (the third and final step of sedimentation). Raw water is pumped
    to a basin where it can sit nearly motionless while the flocs fall to the bottom.
    This basin can be as simple as a rectangular concrete box that’s regularly drained
    and cleaned, but many water treatment plants use tanks called clarifiers that
    include mechanisms to collect the solids as they settle at the bottom automatically.
    These circular basins are a recognizable component of many water treatment plants.
    The raw water flows up through the center of the clarifier and slowly makes its
    way toward the outer perimeter, dropping particles that form a layer of sludge
    at the bottom. The clarified water passes over a weir so that only a thin layer
    farthest from the sludge can exit the basin. A scraper pushes the sludge down
    the sloped bottom of the clarifier into a hopper where it can be collected for
    disposal.

    sedimentation with a process of *filtration*, which involves forcing water to
    pass through porous media. The filters in municipal treatment plants commonly
    consist of layers of sand, coal, or other granular materials. The water flows
    by gravity or under pressure from pumps through the filter media while undesirable
    particles within the water are left behind. A layer of gravel prevents any of
    the media from washing out with the filtered water. Over time, solids accumulate
    within the filter media, reducing its efficiency. Filters are *backwashed* by
    sending water through the opposite direction to clean the media. The backwash
    water is sent back to the treatment plant inlet to be reprocessed.

    which consist of thin sheets of semipermeable material. Pressurized water is forced
    through the tiny pores in the membrane, leaving any unwanted particles behind.
    Water treatment plants using membrane filtration usually have a rack of tubular
    filter modules, allowing quick replacement of individual units if they clog or
    malfunction. Membrane filters can remove even the tiniest contaminants (including
    even viruses), so they are sometimes preferred over using multiple separate treatment
    processes to create potable water.

    remaining parasites, bacteria, and viruses are killed. There are several methods
    for deactivating microorganisms to make water potable, but the primary tool used
    in most cities involves adding a disinfectant chemical to the water (usually either
    chlorine or chloramine). These chemicals are safe for human consumption at low
    concentrations while still killing microorganisms that can make us sick. Many
    treatment plants use chlorine gas stored in metal tanks called cylinders. An injection
    system carefully feeds the gas at a predetermined rate where it dissolves into
    the water and kills disease-causing pathogens.

    system* consists of all the interconnected pipes, valves, and other elements that
    combine to carry clean water used for drinking, cleaning, cooking, watering plants,
    and a wide variety of commercial and industrial processes. The distribution system
    also provides a secondary benefit as a pressurized water supply for fighting fires
    to minimize their chance of spreading to adjacent structures. Unlike raw water

    located at the raw water intakes described previously, pumps do the job of pressurizing
    pipes within the system, usually to between two and six times normal atmospheric
    pressure, which is why they are often called *high-service pumps*. (Some of this
    pressure gets stored in tanks or water towers, as discussed in the next section.)
    Pumping stations are usually located within a water treatment plant to send fresh
    water on its way. The pressure that pumps provide not only induces the potable
    water to flow to its destination but also ensures that contaminants can’t enter
    the distribution system through open joints or small holes in the pipes. If leaks
    develop, water will flow out of the pressurized system rather than allow impurities
    or pollutants to enter. High-service pumps used in water distribution systems
    consume significant amounts of electricity, so they often require robust connections
    to the electrical grid and backup generators for potential outages. Energy is
    often one of the highest ongoing costs for a water utility. Conserving water reduces
    waste of the water itself and reduces the significant amount of energy required
    to collect, clean, and deliver it.

    repaired without affecting the rest of the network. Gridded water mains also help
    avoid stagnation. When pipes have dead-ends, water flows only when users along
    each particular line turn on the tap. If clean water sits in a pipe for an extended
    duration, the disinfectant can decay, deteriorating the water quality. In gridded
    systems, the water in the pipes continuously circulates to meet demands wherever

    is possible, it’s usually a difficult ordeal. Isolating the main from the rest
    of the system before starting repairs is much easier. Shutoff valves are typically
    located at intersections in water mains to allow parts of the network to be disconnected
    so crews can fix a broken pipe. Valves are installed in belowground enclosures
    with small steel lids. Most pipe intersections have one line without a valve to
    save installation and maintenance costs. If the unvalved pipe must be isolated,
    all the other valves at the intersection are shut. Crews use a valve key to open
    or close each valve, as needed. Similarly, one or more shutoff valves are also
    included at each service connection so that individual homes or businesses can
    be isolated for plumbing repairs or during an emergency.

    pressurized water mains to help extinguish fires. Most places in the United States
    use dry-barrel hydrants, which have their valves located belowground, protecting
    them from damage due to errant vehicles and reducing the chance of water freezing
    within the exposed hydrant. In some places, the color of the hydrant nozzle caps
    indicates the maximum flow rate available for firefighting. In colder areas, hydrants
    may include markers that extend above the snowfall to make them easier to locate

    to meet changing demands. In addition, all the treatment facilities and pumps
    would need to be sized for peak water needs, even if they were used to their total
    capacity only once or twice per year, increasing their cost and complexity. Tanks

    and other infrastructure to be operated for average conditions. When usage is

    level at a glance. Some cities use ground excavations to form ponds called finished
    water reservoirs that hold significant volumes at a relatively low cost. These
    ponds are often lined with plastic or concrete to prevent leakage and are covered
    to minimize the chance of contamination (although some uncovered reservoirs still

    also the energy imparted to it by the pumps. *Elevated storage* smooths the demands
    on pumps, allowing them to run consistently instead of cycling on and off to meet
    changing water demands throughout the day. In some areas where electricity costs
    vary, pumps can run at night when power is cheap to fill up tanks, and be left
    off during peak hours when electricity is more expensive. Elevated storage is

    tank serves as an emergency reserve that can be pumped into the distribution system

    virtual ocean (called the hydraulic grade line by engineers). Customers at low
    elevations are at the bottom of the virtual ocean, where pressures are highest,
    and customers at high elevations will be near the surface of the virtual ocean
    where pressure is lowest. The ideal depth is usually around 30 to 60 meters (approximately
    100 to 200 feet), which means most water towers are set so that their low and
    high water levels are within this range. Water stored less than 15 meters (around
    50 feet) above the system may not create enough pressure to prevent potential
    contamination. Cities with large changes in elevation sometimes maintain independent
    water distribution networks at different pressures to keep customers within the
    ideal range.

    rate, the system pressure goes down, and water flows out of the tank through the
    same pipe to supplement water from the treatment plant. Other than water, there’s
    not much inside. Most tanks feature an overflow to prevent them from overfilling.
    Vents make sure that the air pressure in the tank doesn’t change with the water
    level, potentially creating positive or negative pressure that could damage the
    structure. Access hatches provide means for maintenance and inspection inside

    columns to protect against corrosion. For cities that use elevated storage, these

    relying only on gravity also constrains sewer design and construction. If the
    sewage flows too quickly, it can damage joints and erode the walls of the pipes.
    However, if the sewage flows too slowly, solids can settle out of suspension and
    build into clogs and constrictions. We can’t adjust gravity up or down to maintain
    this balance of flow velocity, and we also don’t have much control over the volume
    of wastewater (since people flush when they flush). The only factors engineers
    can control are the size of the sewer pipe and its slope. Each sewer line is carefully
    sized and sloped according to the expected quantity of wastewater to keep it flowing

    a sanitary manhole is installed to provide access for maintenance and inspection.
    Manholes are usually made from vertical concrete enclosures that run up to the

    called a cover, keeps people and debris out of the sewers while allowing vehicles
    to drive over the top. Manholes also sometimes serve as vents to equalize the
    air pressure within the lines and prevent the buildup of toxic gases. When the
    top of a maintenance hole is vulnerable to flooding, cities often require that
    the cover be sealed and bolted shut to exclude rainwater from entering the pipes.
    In this case, vents sometimes extend above the required flood level to keep air
    pressure from building up, even during heavy storms. A temporary ventilation system
    is used whenever someone enters a manhole to provide fresh air during repairs

    especially toward their downstream ends, making construction costly and time-consuming.
    In some cases, it isn’t feasible to chase the slope of a sewer farther and farther
    below the ground surface. One alternative is to install a pumping station that
    can lift raw sewage from its depths back up and closer to the surface. Lift stations
    can be small installations designed to handle a few apartment complexes or massive
    projects that pump significant portions of a city’s wastewater flow. A typical
    wastewater lift station consists of a concrete chamber called a wet well. Sewage
    flows into the wet well by gravity via the inlet sewer, filling it over time.
    Once the level reaches a prescribed depth, a pump turns on, pushing the wastewater
    into a pipe called a force main. This intermittent operation makes sure that sewage
    is always moving swiftly through the line so that solids don’t settle out of suspension
    during off-peak hours. The sewage travels under pressure within the force main
    to an uphill manhole where it can once again continue its journey downward via
    gravity. Lift stations usually feature multiple pumps so that they can continue
    operating if one fails. They often have backup generators so that the sewage can
    continue to flow even if grid power is lost.

    Now nearly all wastewater collection systems rely on some kind of treatment plant
    to reverse the dirtying process, removing contaminants from the water so it can
    be reused or released back into the environment. Technology continues to evolve,
    and a wide variety of processes are used in wastewater treatment around the world.

    sewage. Many of these steps are similar to those used in drinking water treatment
    plants (discussed previously). However, the standards are generally lower since
    processed water (called effluent) will not be used for human consumption but only
    must be safe enough to release into the environment. The initial steps in a water
    treatment plant, called *primary treatment*, involve the physical separation of
    contaminants that are suspended in the swift and turbulent flow. First, sewage
    flows through a bar screen that filters out large debris like sticks, rags, and
    any other large pieces of detritus that find their way into the sewers. Many technologies
    exist, including bar screens equipped with automated rakes that scrape the filtered
    debris into a bin to be discarded as solid waste.

    wastewater are collectively known as *grit*. These materials can damage equipment
    in the plant, so they are usually removed in a separate process during primary
    treatment. Treatment plants use grit chambers, often configured as long narrow
    tanks, to slow down wastewater flow. Within these placid conditions, suspended
    sediments will settle to the bottom of the chamber while the grit-free wastewater
    continues to the outlet. Some grit chambers introduce air bubbles that help fling
    heavier particles to the edges of the tank. Others use a motorized agitator to
    create a vortex in the flow to accomplish a similar feat. A sump at the bottom
    of the chamber collects the settled grit to be pumped away for disposal.

    leaving the grit chamber is still full of suspended solids, but they mainly consist
    of small, organic particles or floating oils and grease (collectively known as
    *scum*). Most treatment plants use primary clarifiers to separate these remaining
    solids. The large circular tanks slow down wastewater flow even further, allowing
    tiny particles to sink gently while a skimmer collects the solids floating on
    the surface. The solids are sent for further processing, and the clarified wastewater
    exits over a weir into the secondary treatment process.

    treatment* does so using biological processes, replicating what Mother Nature
    would do naturally but in a much shorter time period. Most wastewater treatment
    plants take advantage of microorganisms that can digest organic matter in sewage.
    As they consume contaminants, these bacteria and protozoa clump together, leaving
    relatively clean water behind. The microorganism communities that thrive in oxygen-rich
    (*aerobic*) environments are different from those that live in oxygen-depleted
    (*anaerobic*) environments. These various colonies consume different nutrients
    from the water, so treatment plants often utilize both aerobic and anaerobic conditions
    to remove wastewater contaminants thoroughly. Aerobic conditions are created in
    aeration basins where blowers generate a constant supply of air that passes through
    diffusers, creating tiny bubbles that mix and dissolve oxygen into the water.

    water with suspended clumps of microorganisms (called mixed liquor) moves from
    the aeration chamber into a secondary clarifier. Here, the colonies of bacteria
    settle to the bottom, allowing only the clean effluent to be discharged. Depending
    on the regulatory requirements, many treatment plants have tertiary processes
    that target specific contaminants. In addition, most treatment plants perform
    a final disinfection to kill any remaining pathogens in the water. Disinfection
    may be completed using dissolved chlorine, ozone gas, or intense ultraviolet lights,
    which deactivate viruses and harmful bacteria. The final effluent from the treatment
    plant is usually discharged into a natural stream, river, or ocean.

    as activated sludge) are returned to the aeration chamber to seed the next colony.
    The rest of the sludge must be discarded. Some treatment plants send sludge directly
    to a landfill for disposal. However, sludge is an organic material and will decompose
    over time, releasing unwanted gases like methane into the environment. Rather
    than allow such decomposition to occur in a landfill, many treatment plants use
    digesters to process organic solids. Digesters convert sludge into biogas, which
    can be used as a fuel for heating or electricity generation, and a solid material
    called digestate (or *biosolids*), which can be dried and landfilled or used as
    fertilizer. Digesters often have mixers to keep sludge blended, large domes to
    collect biogas as it is generated, and a flare that serves as a safety measure.
    If too much biogas is created than can be stored, operators will allow the gas
    to combust in the flare, converting the harmful constituents into safer gases
    to be released into the environment.

    a channel to convey runoff. Eventually, the road will reach a natural low point
    and start back uphill or will have collected so much runoff that it can’t hold

    release untreated sewage directly into watercourses when the inflow is too much
    to be stored or processed. That’s why most cities now separate storm sewers from
    the sanitary sewers used to carry wastewater. Rain usually enters a storm sewer
    system through a curb inlet or surface grate. Inlets are located at all low points
    along a road (called *sags*) and at regular spacing on sloped sections. Many inlets
    include a manhole so that they can be accessed for cleaning and maintenance. A
    storm sewer pipe connects to each inlet to carry rainwater away. Each line is

    with concrete. This design strategy is often known as *channelization*. Speeding
    up stormwater flow through channelization helps reduce the depth and extents of
    flooding, but it also has disadvantages. Dirty concrete channels hurt the visual
    character of a city. Channelization can also worsen flooding downstream and degrade

    absorbing all the rain that rushes off the buildings, streets, and parking lots.
    Their outlet structures are designed to slowly release runoff back into waterways,

    to bridge over every minor channel and topographic depression in the landscape.
    When a roadway intersects with a minor watercourse, a culvert allows water to
    cross below from one side to the other. Engineers select the culvert pipe size
    to reduce the possibility of rainwater overtopping the roadway. Headwalls and
    wingwalls hold the embankment back while guiding stormwater into the culvert.
    A poorly designed culvert can let water through while obstructing the movement

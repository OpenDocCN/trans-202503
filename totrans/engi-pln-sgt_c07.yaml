- en: Water is a fundamental human need, but its cleanliness is just as important.
    Even before the advent of modern municipal engineering, many civilizations had
    developed strategies for delivering fresh water to urban areas and removing wastewater
    to prevent it from contaminating water sources. In the 19th century, as cities
    worldwide began to grow in population and density, the threat to public health
    from waterborne diseases became more menacing and insidious. The science of sanitation
    developed as a necessity to keep city-dwellers safe from plague and pestilence.
    Now nearly all cities and towns have complex systems for delivering abundant and
    clean water to their citizens and disposing of sewage. Although easy to take for
    granted, the development and maintenance of municipal water and wastewater systems
    are massive undertakings, requiring a lot of infrastructure. Much of the pipes
    and valves in cities are buried below the ground, but you can observe many facilities
    and equipment if you know where to look.

  zh: 水是人类的基本需求，但其清洁度同样重要。即使在现代市政工程出现之前，许多文明已经开发出将淡水输送到城市区域并去除废水的策略，以防止其污染水源。19世纪，随着全球城市人口和密度的增长，水传播疾病对公共健康的威胁变得更加严重和隐蔽。卫生学作为一项科学应运而生，成为保护城市居民免受瘟疫和传染病侵害的必要手段。现在几乎所有城市和城镇都有复杂的系统来为市民提供充足和清洁的水源，并处理污水。虽然这一切容易被视为理所当然，但市政水务和污水系统的开发与维护是庞大的工程，涉及大量基础设施。城市中的许多管道和阀门都埋在地下，但如果你知道在哪里寻找，还是可以看到许多设施和设备的。

    starts its journey in a river, stream, creek, lake, or reservoir. These sources
    are collectively known as *surface waters* (as opposed to groundwater resources,
    which are discussed in the next section). Collecting water from a river or lake
    might seem straightforward; however, many engineering challenges are associated
    with transitioning the flow from a surface water source into a pipeline or *aqueduct*
    to be delivered to its destination. *Intake structures* perform this critical
    task. They can be associated with an impoundment or diversion (for example, at
    a dam), but intakes are often standalone structures, and you’ll see them near
    riverbanks, lakes, or reservoirs if you keep an eye out.

  zh: 我们用于饮用、清洁和灌溉农作物的大部分水源，开始时都来自河流、小溪、湖泊或水库。这些水源统称为*地表水*（与接下来章节讨论的地下水资源相对）。从河流或湖泊收集水似乎很直接；然而，将地表水源的水流引入管道或*渡槽*，并将其输送到目的地，涉及许多工程挑战。*取水结构*执行这一关键任务。它们可能与水库或引水设施（例如大坝）相关联，但取水口通常是独立的结构，如果你留心观察，会在河岸、湖泊或水库附近看到它们。
- en: Lake or reservoir intakes often consist of large concrete or masonry towers
    (as discussed in Chapter 6). Complicating matters, a structure considered an *outlet*
    at a dam might also serve as an *intake* for a pumping station or aqueduct. Older
    structures called crib intakes were  constructed onshore, floated into place,
    and then filled with rubble. A central shaft carries water by gravity through
    the intake to a tunnel below the lake where it can be pumped to treatment and
    distribution facilities on the shore.

  zh: 湖泊或水库的取水口通常由大型混凝土或砖石塔构成（如第六章所述）。更复杂的是，在大坝处被认为是*排放口*的结构，可能也会作为泵站或渡槽的*取水口*。以前被称为“格架取水口”的旧结构是建造在岸上，浮到指定位置后，再用碎石填充。一个中央轴承通过重力将水从取水口引入到湖泊下方的隧道，水随后被抽送到岸上的处理和分配设施。
- en: Although complete removal of contaminants and sediment is usually performed
    later, the engineering of intakes includes making sure that the source water entering
    a pipe is as clean as possible to reduce the burden on downstream water treatment
    plants. This untreated water is often known as *raw water*. In reservoirs and
    lakes, the volume of suspended sediments, the quantity of microorganisms like
    plankton and algae, and even the temperature of the water can vary significantly
    with depth. Thus, most intake structures on lakes and reservoirs have openings
    (or *ports*) at multiple levels so that operators can select the ideal mixture
    of water from the depths within the lake or reservoir. Gates on the various openings
    can be opened or closed depending on the conditions within the source water and
    the needs downstream.

  zh: 尽管污染物和沉积物的完全去除通常在后期进行，但进水口的工程设计包括确保进入管道的源水尽可能清洁，以减轻下游水处理厂的负担。这种未经处理的水通常被称为*原水*。在水库和湖泊中，悬浮沉积物的体积、浮游生物和藻类等微生物的数量，甚至水温，都可能随深度显著变化。因此，大多数湖泊和水库的进水结构都有多个不同高度的开口（或*端口*），以便操作人员可以从湖泊或水库的不同深度中选择理想的水源混合物。各种开口上的门可以根据源水的状况和下游的需求进行开启或关闭。
- en: Intakes on rivers contend with a different set of challenges. First, the level
    in a river can vary significantly. In addition, river intakes must contend with
    the fact that streams are dynamic systems. Floods can move massive quantities
    of sediment, changing the location and shape of banks and even altering the course
    of a river altogether. River intakes are almost always located either on a straight
    section of the channel or on the outside of a bend. Sediment tends to deposit
    on the inside of curves where flows are slower, so engineers avoid those locations
    where an intake could be clogged more readily. Bank intakes are installed on a
    riverbank to allow water to flow laterally into the structure. However, the deepest
    part of a natural channel (called the *thalweg*) is often in the center, so bank
    intakes often require dredging of the riverbed to allow water to flow when the
    river level is low. This dredging is not only disruptive to the sensitive environment
    of a river, but it must be performed regularly as sediments in the river deposit
    over time.

  zh: 河流的进水口面临一套不同的挑战。首先，河流水位可能变化很大。此外，河流进水口还必须应对河流是动态系统这一事实。洪水能够搬运大量沉积物，改变河岸的位置和形状，甚至可能完全改变河流的流向。河流进水口几乎总是位于河道的直段或弯道的外侧。沉积物往往沉积在弯道的内侧，因为那里水流较慢，因此工程师会避免选择容易被堵塞的地方。岸边进水口通常安装在河岸上，以允许水横向流入结构。然而，天然河道的最深部分（称为*河床*）通常位于中央，因此岸边进水口往往需要进行河床疏浚，以便在水位较低时仍能保证水流。这种疏浚不仅会对河流敏感的环境造成干扰，而且必须定期进行，因为河流中的沉积物会随时间沉积。
- en: One solution to the challenges of varying water levels and sediment buildup
    is constructing a small *weir* downstream. Such a structure raises the water level
    in the river while also slowing down the flow so that sediment can settle out.
    However, weirs create an impediment to navigation and migratory wildlife, and
    they can be quite dangerous (as discussed in Chapter 6), so their use has fallen
    out of favor. Modern intake structures on rivers make use of careful siting to
    avoid problems with sedimentation and lower water levels while minimizing environmental
    impacts. One alternative to bank intakes involves running a conduit from a deeper
    section of the channel to the shore, often performed using tunneling to avoid
    the need for trenching in the natural riverbank. A screen on the end of the conduit
    prevents fish or debris from entering the line, and a gate controls the flow.

  zh: 解决水位变化和沉积物堆积问题的一种方法是下游建造一个小型*堰*。这种结构提高了河流中的水位，同时减缓了水流速度，使沉积物可以沉降。然而，堰对航运和迁徙野生动物造成了障碍，并且可能非常危险（如第六章所讨论），因此它们的使用已不再受到青睐。现代河流进水结构通过精心选址来避免沉积物堆积和低水位问题，同时最小化环境影响。岸边进水口的一种替代方案是通过隧道将管道从河道较深的部分延伸到岸边，以避免在天然河岸上开挖。这种管道末端的筛网可以防止鱼类或杂物进入管道，且门控系统可控制水流。
- en: Unless the final destination of the raw water is well below the source, most
    intakes will be accompanied by a *pumping station*, which lifts the water from
    its source into a pipeline or aqueduct. Pumps are often installed directly above
    or adjacent to the intake structure, sometimes within a building called a pump
    house. These structures may be recognizable by built-in gantry cranes that allow
    equipment to be serviced or replaced when needed.

- en: At a pumping station, water flows into ports, through a conduit or tunnel, then
    into a structure called a *sump* (or wet well), which creates enough volume and
    depth for pumps to operate. Sumps must be designed to create ideal flow conditions
    to avoid inefficiencies and damage to the pump. Turbulent and swirling flow in
    a sump can lead to a *vortex,* just like what happens when you drain a bathtub.
    If a vortex is allowed to enter the mouth of the pump column, the air will reduce
    its efficiency and may even cause it to fail. Vortex breakers are sometimes installed
    within sumps to keep the flow from swirling as it is drawn into the pump.

- en: Intakes can represent a severe hazard to swimmers and boaters in rivers and
    lakes because of the submerged structures and fast-flowing water. Where public
    safety may be at risk, owners of intakes often install floating booms to warn
    people of the potential danger. These booms consist of brightly colored floating
    elements linked together with chains. They are anchored to the river or lakebed
    to create an exclusion zone around a dangerous structure. Some booms are even
    designed to be strong enough to hold back debris, floating trees, and ice that
    could damage intake structures. In addition, when an intake or pumping station
    must be located near the bank, armoring (such as *rock riprap*) is usually installed
    to protect against erosion that could threaten the structure.

    seeps down into the ground through the spaces between soil and rock particles.
    Sometimes this groundwater reaches a less permeable geologic layer (called an
    aquitard) and cannot continue downward. Over long periods of time, infiltrating
    water can accumulate into vast underground resources called aquifers. A common
    misconception is that groundwater is stored in open areas like underground rivers
    or lakes. Although they exist in some locations, large underground caverns are
    relatively rare. Nearly all groundwater aquifers are geologic formations of sand,
    gravel, or rock that are saturated with water, just like a sponge. Extracting
    this groundwater for use by humans is the job of a *well*. At their simplest,
    wells are just holes into which groundwater can seep from the surrounding soil.
    However, modern wells utilize sophisticated engineering to provide a reliable
    and long-lasting source of fresh water. Farms use them for irrigation. Rural homes
    and businesses often rely on them when a connection to a municipal distribution
    system is unavailable. And many large cities utilize groundwater as a primary
    source of fresh water for their populations.

  zh: 并非所有降水都会流入湖泊和河流。一些水分会通过土壤和岩石颗粒之间的空隙渗入地下。有时，这些地下水会到达一个渗透性较差的地质层（称为隔水层），并无法继续向下渗透。随着时间的推移，渗透水可以积聚成巨大的地下资源，称为含水层。一个常见的误解是，地下水存储在类似地下河流或湖泊的开放空间中。尽管在一些地方确实存在，但大型地下洞窟相对稀少。几乎所有地下水含水层都是由沙子、砾石或岩石构成的地质层，这些地层像海绵一样被水饱和。提取这些地下水供人类使用的工作由*水井*来完成。最简单的水井就是一个可以让地下水从周围土壤渗入的孔。然而，现代水井利用复杂的工程技术提供可靠且持久的淡水来源。农场用它们进行灌溉。农村的家庭和企业通常依赖水井，当无法连接到市政供水系统时，水井是他们的主要水源。许多大城市也利用地下水作为其居民的主要淡水来源。

    all places have layers of saturated soil or rock below the ground. Still, the
    volume of water, its quality, and the ease of extracting it to the surface depend

    hydrologic system, so groundwater withdrawals may impact the volume and quality
    of surface water resources. Unfortunately, we can’t see below the ground, and
    methods for exploring subsurface geology mainly involve drilling *boreholes*,
    which can be quite expensive. Thus, the availability of groundwater in a specific
    area is usually determined by combining many sources of information, including

    support so that loose soil and rock can’t fall into the well. A screen is attached
    to the casing at the depths where water will be withdrawn. The screen allows groundwater
    to flow into the casing while keeping larger soil and rock particles out of the

- en: Once the casing and screen are installed, the *annular space* (the area between
    the excavated borehole and casing) must be filled. Where the well is screened,
    this space is usually filled with gravel or coarse sand called gravel pack. This
    material acts as a filter to keep fine particles of the aquifer formation from
    entering the well through the screen. The space along unscreened casing is usually
    filled with bentonite clay, which swells to create an impermeable seal so that
    shallower groundwater (which may be lower quality) can’t travel along the annular
    space into the screens. Finally, the uppermost section of the annular space is
    permanently sealed, again using bentonite clay or sometimes using cement grout.
    This seal ensures that contaminants on the surface cannot find their way into
    the well. In a worst-case scenario, pollutants could enter a well and flow into
    the aquifer, contaminating it for other users, so most jurisdictions have strict
    rules for sealing wells at the surface. The casing is usually extended aboveground
    to create a wellhead with a concrete pad extending in all directions to prevent
    damage or infiltration to the well.

    only so much atmosphere is available to balance the weight of a fluid in a suction
    pipe. If you could create a complete vacuum in a straw, the highest you could

    compel water to flow since gravity does all the work. Many aqueducts have very
    gradual slopes such that the incline is practically imperceptible to the eye.
    However, the amount of fluid that can flow by gravity is related to the channel’s

    The flow velocity must be fast enough to minimize settling of silt on the canal
    floor but slow enough to avoid scouring and erosion. The channel also must be

    the evaporation of water into the air or seepage into the soil below. Engineers
    balance these factors when selecting the route a canal will take and the shape
    of the channel along the way. For example, many aqueducts run parallel to rivers
    where the topography naturally descends over long distances, and most canals use
    a trapezoidal cross section with sloped sides that are less likely to collapse.

    Smaller pipes are less expensive, but they require water to move faster to achieve
    the equivalent flow of a larger pipe. Water loses energy through friction, and
    these losses increase with velocity, so the money saved by installing a smaller
    pipe might be lost over time from the increased cost of pumping. For long pipelines,
    these frictional losses might be so significant to require booster pumps along
    the way that maintain pressure in the system. As pipes age, their inner surfaces
    get rougher, so engineers must consider the friction and pumping costs through
    the entire lifetime of the pipeline.

    a fully loaded freight train. When all that water is moving through a pipe, it
    has quite a bit of momentum. However, even though it’s a fluid, water isn’t very
    compressible, so closing a valve or stopping a pump gives that momentum nowhere
    to go. Instead, it creates a spike in pressure that travels as a shockwave through
    the pipe, an effect called *water hammer*. These shockwaves can be a problem in
    residential homes when taps close too quickly, resulting in lines knocking in
    the walls. However, in large pipelines that can contain immense volumes of fluid,
    closing a valve quickly can be the equivalent of slamming a freight train into
    a concrete wall. To avoid spikes in pressure that could damage equipment or rupture
    pipes, engineers specify slow-closing valves and pumps that start and stop gradually.
    In situations where operators need rapid control over the flow, surge tanks can
    be installed to absorb the extreme pressure spikes and minimize the damaging effects
    of water hammer.

    particles can negatively affect the water’s taste and smell. Before water can
    be distributed to homes and businesses where it may be used for drinking or cooking,
    it usually must first go through a purification process at a water treatment plant
    to be made *potable*. A wide variety of techniques are used to purify water and
    ensure that it’s safe for human consumption. Most water treatment plants are custom-designed
    for a specific water source and the potential contaminants that threaten it. For
    example, groundwater often requires less treatment than surface water sources
    because it is less vulnerable to pollution. Not every treatment plant uses the
    same set of processes, and not all parts of a water treatment plant are visible

    These solid particles give the water a murky appearance (called *turbidity*) and
    can harbor dangerous microorganisms. The first step in most treatment plants is
    to remove these suspended particles from the water in a process called *sedimentation,*
    which is often accomplished in a series of three stages. First, a chemical *coagulant*
    is vigorously mixed into the water. Coagulants neutralize the electric charges
    that cause suspended particles to repel each other, allowing them to stick together.
    Next, a chemical *flocculant* is added to the water, which bonds suspended particles
    together into groups called flocs. Flocculant is added to the raw water slowly
    to avoid breaking up the flocs.

    to settle out (the third and final step of sedimentation). Raw water is pumped
    to a basin where it can sit nearly motionless while the flocs fall to the bottom.
    This basin can be as simple as a rectangular concrete box that’s regularly drained
    and cleaned, but many water treatment plants use tanks called clarifiers that
    include mechanisms to collect the solids as they settle at the bottom automatically.
    These circular basins are a recognizable component of many water treatment plants.
    The raw water flows up through the center of the clarifier and slowly makes its
    way toward the outer perimeter, dropping particles that form a layer of sludge
    at the bottom. The clarified water passes over a weir so that only a thin layer
    farthest from the sludge can exit the basin. A scraper pushes the sludge down
    the sloped bottom of the clarifier into a hopper where it can be collected for
    disposal.

    water of tiny particles, viruses, and bacteria. Most water treatment plants follow
    sedimentation with a process of *filtration*, which involves forcing water to
    pass through porous media. The filters in municipal treatment plants commonly
    consist of layers of sand, coal, or other granular materials. The water flows
    by gravity or under pressure from pumps through the filter media while undesirable
    particles within the water are left behind. A layer of gravel prevents any of
    the media from washing out with the filtered water. Over time, solids accumulate
    within the filter media, reducing its efficiency. Filters are *backwashed* by
    sending water through the opposite direction to clean the media. The backwash
    water is sent back to the treatment plant inlet to be reprocessed.

    Water treatment plants using membrane filtration usually have a rack of tubular
    filter modules, allowing quick replacement of individual units if they clog or
    malfunction. Membrane filters can remove even the tiniest contaminants (including

    chlorine or chloramine). These chemicals are safe for human consumption at low
    concentrations while still killing microorganisms that can make us sick. Many
    treatment plants use chlorine gas stored in metal tanks called cylinders. An injection
    system carefully feeds the gas at a predetermined rate where it dissolves into
    the water and kills disease-causing pathogens.

    quality. Many different potential contaminants can be hazardous to human health,

    utility’s service area. Potable water is transported from wells or treatment plants,
    sometimes across many miles, to each home and business. A municipal *water distribution
    system* consists of all the interconnected pipes, valves, and other elements that
    combine to carry clean water used for drinking, cleaning, cooking, watering plants,
    and a wide variety of commercial and industrial processes. The distribution system
    also provides a secondary benefit as a pressurized water supply for fighting fires
    to minimize their chance of spreading to adjacent structures. Unlike raw water
    infrastructure consisting of large, singular facilities, a water distribution

    located at the raw water intakes described previously, pumps do the job of pressurizing
    pipes within the system, usually to between two and six times normal atmospheric
    pressure, which is why they are often called *high-service pumps*. (Some of this
    pressure gets stored in tanks or water towers, as discussed in the next section.)
    Pumping stations are usually located within a water treatment plant to send fresh
    water on its way. The pressure that pumps provide not only induces the potable
    water to flow to its destination but also ensures that contaminants can’t enter
    the distribution system through open joints or small holes in the pipes. If leaks
    develop, water will flow out of the pressurized system rather than allow impurities
    or pollutants to enter. High-service pumps used in water distribution systems
    consume significant amounts of electricity, so they often require robust connections
    to the electrical grid and backup generators for potential outages. Energy is
    often one of the highest ongoing costs for a water utility. Conserving water reduces
    waste of the water itself and reduces the significant amount of energy required
    to collect, clean, and deliver it.

    belowground to protect them from damage and, more important, from freezing. Most
    mains are connected in a grid or loop pattern, often following the paths of city
    streets. Many jurisdictions require that water mains be horizontally separated

    on opposite sides of a street.

    repaired without affecting the rest of the network. Gridded water mains also help
    avoid stagnation. When pipes have dead-ends, water flows only when users along
    each particular line turn on the tap. If clean water sits in a pipe for an extended
    duration, the disinfectant can decay, deteriorating the water quality. In gridded

    is possible, it’s usually a difficult ordeal. Isolating the main from the rest
    of the system before starting repairs is much easier. Shutoff valves are typically
    located at intersections in water mains to allow parts of the network to be disconnected
    so crews can fix a broken pipe. Valves are installed in belowground enclosures
    with small steel lids. Most pipe intersections have one line without a valve to
    save installation and maintenance costs. If the unvalved pipe must be isolated,
    all the other valves at the intersection are shut. Crews use a valve key to open
    or close each valve, as needed. Similarly, one or more shutoff valves are also
    included at each service connection so that individual homes or businesses can
    be isolated for plumbing repairs or during an emergency.

    pressurized water mains to help extinguish fires. Most places in the United States
    use dry-barrel hydrants, which have their valves located belowground, protecting
    them from damage due to errant vehicles and reducing the chance of water freezing
    within the exposed hydrant. In some places, the color of the hydrant nozzle caps
    indicates the maximum flow rate available for firefighting. In colder areas, hydrants
    may include markers that extend above the snowfall to make them easier to locate

    and reservoirs smooth out the peaks and valleys of water demand, allowing pumps
    and other infrastructure to be operated for average conditions. When usage is

    also the energy imparted to it by the pumps. *Elevated storage* smooths the demands

    changing water demands throughout the day. In some areas where electricity costs
    vary, pumps can run at night when power is cheap to fill up tanks, and be left

    elevations are at the bottom of the virtual ocean, where pressures are highest,
    and customers at high elevations will be near the surface of the virtual ocean
    where pressure is lowest. The ideal depth is usually around 30 to 60 meters (approximately
    100 to 200 feet), which means most water towers are set so that their low and
    high water levels are within this range. Water stored less than 15 meters (around
    50 feet) above the system may not create enough pressure to prevent potential

    rate, the system pressure goes down, and water flows out of the tank through the
    same pipe to supplement water from the treatment plant. Other than water, there’s
    not much inside. Most tanks feature an overflow to prevent them from overfilling.
    Vents make sure that the air pressure in the tank doesn’t change with the water

    flows into the wet well by gravity via the inlet sewer, filling it over time.
    Once the level reaches a prescribed depth, a pump turns on, pushing the wastewater
    into a pipe called a force main. This intermittent operation makes sure that sewage
    is always moving swiftly through the line so that solids don’t settle out of suspension
    during off-peak hours. The sewage travels under pressure within the force main
    to an uphill manhole where it can once again continue its journey downward via
    gravity. Lift stations usually feature multiple pumps so that they can continue
    operating if one fails. They often have backup generators so that the sewage can
    continue to flow even if grid power is lost.

    sewage is a slurry of liquids and solids from a wide variety of sources. Lots
    of stuff ends up in our wastewater stream, including soil, soap, hair, food, wipes,
    grease, and trash. These things may make it down the toilet or sink drain and
    through the plumbing in your house with no problem. However, in the sewer system,
    they can conglomerate into large balls of debris (sometimes called *pigtails*
    or *fatbergs* by wastewater professionals). In addition, with many cities putting
    efforts into water conservation, the concentration of solids in wastewater is
    trending upward. Conventional pumps handle liquids just fine, but adding solids
    in the stream increases the challenge of lifting raw sewage. Pumps used in wastewater
    lift stations are designed for extra wear and tear, but no pump is entirely clog-proof.'

    wet well to prevent trash from reaching the pumps. Every so often, the garbage
    caught in the mesh must be removed from the wet well and hauled away to a landfill.
    Smaller lift stations often use a basket screen on rails that can be manually
    lifted through an access hatch at the surface. Larger pump stations may have automatic
    systems that remove solids from the screen into a dumpster. Another solution to
    debris in the wastewater stream is to grind it into smaller pieces. Some lift
    stations feature *grinders* that chew through debris so it can’t clog the pumps,
    minimizing the need for staff to visit the station to perform repairs or remove
    trash. The solids remain in the wastewater stream to be removed farther down the
    line at a treatment plant (discussed in the next section).

- en: Water gets along with nearly every substance on Earth, which is a significant
    part of why it does such an excellent job of carrying our wastes away from homes
    and businesses in sewers. Before modern environmental regulations, it was not
    uncommon for a city to discharge raw sewage into rivers to be carried away downstream.
    Now nearly all wastewater collection systems rely on some kind of treatment plant
    to reverse the dirtying process, removing contaminants from the water so it can
    be reused or released back into the environment. Technology continues to evolve,
    and a wide variety of processes are used in wastewater treatment around the world.
    This section discusses some of the most common treatment methods modern wastewater
    plants use. If you can cope with the smell, many municipal treatment plants are
    happy to offer tours to the public where you can see each process in action.

- en: Wastewater treatment plants use many discrete steps in the process of cleaning
    sewage. Many of these steps are similar to those used in drinking water treatment
    plants (discussed previously). However, the standards are generally lower since
    processed water (called effluent) will not be used for human consumption but only
    must be safe enough to release into the environment. The initial steps in a water
    treatment plant, called *primary treatment*, involve the physical separation of
    contaminants that are suspended in the swift and turbulent flow. First, sewage
    flows through a bar screen that filters out large debris like sticks, rags, and
    any other large pieces of detritus that find their way into the sewers. Many technologies
    exist, including bar screens equipped with automated rakes that scrape the filtered
    debris into a bin to be discarded as solid waste.

- en: Next, suspended particles are separated from the flow. Sand and soil found in
    wastewater are collectively known as *grit*. These materials can damage equipment
    in the plant, so they are usually removed in a separate process during primary
    treatment. Treatment plants use grit chambers, often configured as long narrow
    tanks, to slow down wastewater flow. Within these placid conditions, suspended
    sediments will settle to the bottom of the chamber while the grit-free wastewater
    continues to the outlet. Some grit chambers introduce air bubbles that help fling
    heavier particles to the edges of the tank. Others use a motorized agitator to
    create a vortex in the flow to accomplish a similar feat. A sump at the bottom
    of the chamber collects the settled grit to be pumped away for disposal.

- en: The final step in primary treatment is also usually a gravity process. Wastewater
    leaving the grit chamber is still full of suspended solids, but they mainly consist
    of small, organic particles or floating oils and grease (collectively known as
    *scum*). Most treatment plants use primary clarifiers to separate these remaining
    solids. The large circular tanks slow down wastewater flow even further, allowing
    tiny particles to sink gently while a skimmer collects the solids floating on
    the surface. The solids are sent for further processing, and the clarified wastewater
    exits over a weir into the secondary treatment process.

- en: Where primary treatment physically separates contaminants from wastewater, *secondary
    treatment* does so using biological processes, replicating what Mother Nature
    would do naturally but in a much shorter time period. Most wastewater treatment
    plants take advantage of microorganisms that can digest organic matter in sewage.
    As they consume contaminants, these bacteria and protozoa clump together, leaving
    relatively clean water behind. The microorganism communities that thrive in oxygen-rich
    (*aerobic*) environments are different from those that live in oxygen-depleted
    (*anaerobic*) environments. These various colonies consume different nutrients
    from the water, so treatment plants often utilize both aerobic and anaerobic conditions
    to remove wastewater contaminants thoroughly. Aerobic conditions are created in
    aeration basins where blowers generate a constant supply of air that passes through
    diffusers, creating tiny bubbles that mix and dissolve oxygen into the water.

- en: Once the biological treatment has consumed most of the nutrients, the cleaned
    water with suspended clumps of microorganisms (called mixed liquor) moves from
    the aeration chamber into a secondary clarifier. Here, the colonies of bacteria
    settle to the bottom, allowing only the clean effluent to be discharged. Depending
    on the regulatory requirements, many treatment plants have tertiary processes
    that target specific contaminants. In addition, most treatment plants perform
    a final disinfection to kill any remaining pathogens in the water. Disinfection
    may be completed using dissolved chlorine, ozone gas, or intense ultraviolet lights,
    which deactivate viruses and harmful bacteria. The final effluent from the treatment
    plant is usually discharged into a natural stream, river, or ocean.

- en: Some of the microorganisms that settle out in the secondary clarifier (known
    as activated sludge) are returned to the aeration chamber to seed the next colony.
    The rest of the sludge must be discarded. Some treatment plants send sludge directly
    to a landfill for disposal. However, sludge is an organic material and will decompose
    over time, releasing unwanted gases like methane into the environment. Rather
    than allow such decomposition to occur in a landfill, many treatment plants use
    digesters to process organic solids. Digesters convert sludge into biogas, which
    can be used as a fuel for heating or electricity generation, and a solid material
    called digestate (or *biosolids*), which can be dried and landfilled or used as
    fertilizer. Digesters often have mixers to keep sludge blended, large domes to
    collect biogas as it is generated, and a flare that serves as a safety measure.
    If too much biogas is created than can be stored, operators will allow the gas
    to combust in the flare, converting the harmful constituents into safer gases
    to be released into the environment.

    the ways water moves above and below the ground during storms. All those streets,
    sidewalks, buildings, and parking lots cover the ground with impervious surfaces
    so that, instead of rainwater infiltrating, it runs off toward creeks and rivers,
    swelling them faster and higher and filling them with more pollution. Where a
    natural watershed acts like a sponge to absorb and slow rainwater as it falls,
    urban watersheds work more like funnels, gathering and concentrating runoff. Stormwater
    and flooding have been a problem ever since people started living in cities, and
    the first solution was simply to get the water out and away as quickly as possible.
    This solution is in the name we still use for how cities manage storms: *drainage*.
    When it rains and when it pours, we try to give that runoff somewhere to go.'

- en: Most cities are organized such that the streets serve as the first path of flow
    for rainfall. Individual lots are graded with a slope toward the road so that
    water flows away from buildings where it would otherwise cause problems. The standard
    city street has a crown in the center with gutters on either side for water to
    flow. This keeps the road mainly dry and safe for vehicle travel while providing
    a channel to convey runoff. Eventually, the road will reach a natural low point
    and start back uphill or will have collected so much runoff that it can’t hold
    it all in the gutter. It is possible to let runoff from a street outfall directly
    into a natural watercourse in some cases. However, in dense urban areas where
    space is limited, stormwater is often routed into underground drains.

- en: In the past, it was common to simply put all the runoff from the streets directly
    into the sanitary sewage system. Unfortunately, wastewater treatment plants are
    usually not designed to process massive influxes of combined sewage and stormwater
    runoff at the whims of Mother Nature. In the worst cases, these plants have to
    release untreated sewage directly into watercourses when the inflow is too much
    to be stored or processed. That’s why most cities now separate storm sewers from
    the sanitary sewers used to carry wastewater. Rain usually enters a storm sewer
    system through a curb inlet or surface grate. Inlets are located at all low points
    along a road (called *sags*) and at regular spacing on sloped sections. Many inlets
    include a manhole so that they can be accessed for cleaning and maintenance. A
    storm sewer pipe connects to each inlet to carry rainwater away. Each line is
    sized and sloped for gravity flow according to the expected volume of stormwater,
    similar to how sanitary sewer pipes are designed to carry a specific volume of
    wastewater.

    streams and rivers. Eventually, the sewers are routed to an outfall in a natural
    watercourse or the ocean. Energy-dissipating baffle blocks or rock riprap armoring
    are often installed at outfalls to protect the natural soils against erosion from
    the swiftly exiting runoff. Unlike a sanitary sewer system that terminates in
    a treatment plant, most stormwater runoff is discharged directly into the environment,
    so cities often include warnings to the public about disposing of waste in curb
    inlets.

    conveying it to streams and rivers. However, the influx of stormwater from urban
    areas exacerbates flooding within these natural water bodies. Many cities increase
    the capacity of natural watercourses by enlarging, straightening, and lining them
    with concrete. This design strategy is often known as *channelization*. Speeding
    up stormwater flow through channelization helps reduce the depth and extents of
    flooding, but it also has disadvantages. Dirty concrete channels hurt the visual
    character of a city. Channelization can also worsen flooding downstream and degrade
    the habitat of the original waterway. Most cities recognize that widening and
    lining natural channels is an incomplete solution to the increased runoff from
    urban development.

- en: As a result, cities now require developers to take responsibility for their
    own impacts on stormwater volume and quality, which usually involves onsite storage
    before releasing drainage into a watercourse. *Retention ponds* maintain a permanent
    pool of water where detention ponds are ordinarily dry. Both act like mini sponges,
    absorbing all the rain that rushes off the buildings, streets, and parking lots.
    Their outlet structures are designed to slowly release runoff back into waterways,
    shaving off the peak flow rate to the level before all the buildings and parking
    lots were built. Retention and detention ponds also help reduce pollution by slowing
    down the water, so suspended particles can settle out.

- en: Along highways, it is not usually economical to manage stormwater below the
    ground. Instead, we often build highways above the natural ground on embankments
    with parallel ditches to carry stormwater. When a roadway crosses over a significant
    stream or river, we often construct a bridge. However, it isn’t cost-effective
    to bridge over every minor channel and topographic depression in the landscape.
    When a roadway intersects with a minor watercourse, a culvert allows water to
    cross below from one side to the other. Engineers select the culvert pipe size
    to reduce the possibility of rainwater overtopping the roadway. Headwalls and
    wingwalls hold the embankment back while guiding stormwater into the culvert.
    A poorly designed culvert can let water through while obstructing the movement
    of animals, so engineers work with biologists and environmental scientists to
    ensure that culverts are appropriately designed for both the water they must carry
    and the creatures that live within it.

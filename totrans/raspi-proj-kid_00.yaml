    THE POWER OF THE RASPBERRY PI COMPUTER AND PYTHON CODE TO CREATE 12 AWESOME PROJECTS.
    YOU CAN THEN TAKE THE NEW SKILLS AND TECHNIQUES YOU LEARN HERE AND APPLY THEM
    TO YOUR OWN PROJECTS. THIS BOOK IS AIMED AT BEGINNERS TO USING THE RASPBERRY PI
    AND BUILDING HACKS, AS WELL AS AT THOSE MORE EXPERIENCED WHO MAY BE LOOKING FOR
    A LITTLE INSPIRATION FOR THEIR OWN NEXT GREAT BUILD.

- en: Over the years, I’ve gained a lot of enjoyment from the Raspberry Pi, a small
    but versatile $35 computer. In my role as a computer science teacher at a large
    school, I’ve been fortunate to witness firsthand the positive and life-changing
    impact of Raspberry Pi–based learning. Using the Pi develops programming skills
    and hones thinking skills, building confidence along the way. The Pi is enormously
    successful as an educational tool, and the key to this success is that the Pi
    is *fun*!

- en: Coding is no longer about just typing out line after line of instructions. Instead,
    you can learn to code by hacking Minecraft, making an MP3 music player, or building
    a spy cam. When using the Raspberry Pi, you’re not just building and coding a
    distance sensor— you’re creating a *friend- or enemy-tracker*.

    it such a great tool for education.

    projects, which I build and share on my website *[www.tecoed.co.uk](http://www.tecoed.co.uk)*.
    I wrote this book because I want to share my passion for making. Most important,
    I wanted to write a book that lets you develop relevant skills through exciting
    and useful hacks.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In each chapter of this book, you’ll learn Python programming skills through
    building cool, inspiring, and useful hacks that can be deployed around your home.
    Each chapter is divided into simple step-by-step instructions, with plenty of
    diagrams to build the project. I’ll also encourage you to test your skills by
    developing your hacks further on your own.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This first chapter provides all the information required for you to get started
    with your Raspberry Pi. It covers setting up the hardware, installing the operating
    system, accessing your Pi from another computer, and other useful skills. If you
    already know your way around the Pi and the Python programming language, you can
    jump straight into one of the hacks.

    language. This primer will prepare you for the projects in the book. Each of the
    following chapters features a standalone hack with all the instructions and code
    required. You can use this chapter as a reference guide whenever you need it and
    to learn more about how to use Python.

- en: This is a simple but exciting hack. You’ll take a glue gun, like the ones you’ve
    probably used in school, and fill a silicone mold of your choice with hot glue.
    Then you’ll add an LED and let it set. When you wire up the LED, you’ll create
    your own custom glue light. You’ll then combine this with a light sensor to create
    a light that gets brighter as the environment gets darker.

    filters, and edit your photos. You’ll then build your own selfie snapper, which
    will automatically take your picture for you, as well as a time-lapse camera.
    Lastly, you’ll learn how to capture video and share it with your friends and family.

    Pi to stream a live video feed to your mobile or tablet device. This is a great
    project for spying on your family, keeping watch on your pets, or monitoring your
    secret stash of sweets.

    You’ll create a trampoline out of grass, build a game where you dodge deadly falling
    blocks of sand, and even use Minecraft to control the glue light that you made
    in [Chapter 3](ch03.xhtml#ch03). In this chapter’s final hack, you’ll build a
    Pi Camera remote control that will enable you to record a video by hitting a block
    of melons in Minecraft!

    own messages, music, or even gossip to local listeners. You’ll hack into the radio
    waves and program a slick interface so you can control the radio with a simple
    click of a button.

    from your Raspberry Pi. You’ll combine these skills to create a personal text-reminder
    assistant that sends you texts at particular times to let you know when to do
    something—like walk the dog, take out the trash, or meet your friend!

    to your home internet or have Bluetooth enabled. You’ll access the make and model
    of the connected devices as well as find out their IP and MAC addresses. The end
    goal is to create a physical status board that lights up whenever a particular
    person enters your house with their device.

    wires, a speaker, and a small box, you’ll build your own MP3 player. You’ll learn
    how to assign actions to each button press so you can change the song or turn
    up the volume. You’ll embed your music player within a small box that you can
    customize and decorate.

    pictures of wildlife. Wire up the parts, write up the code, secure it all in a
    box, and you can deploy your nature box in your yard or around your local area.
    The sensor will alert the Pi when something moves nearby, and the Pi will take
    a picture. You’ll even rig this hack to upload your images to Dropbox so you can
    view them remotely without disturbing shy wildlife visitors.

    power in your home, giving you the ability to remotely turn lights on and off,
    boil a kettle, or turn on the TV—all with your phone or tablet. This is a great
    project for pranking people.

    same time? You build a social media mirror, that’s how. This useful hack turns
    your mirror into a set of flashing lights that notifies you when you receive messages
    from particular users, when you get retweets, or when particular keywords come
    up on your feed. The mirror even relays the messages via a speaker so you don’t
    have to stop what you’re doing to read them.

    Space Station to expand on the classic rock, paper, scissors game and create rock,
    paper, scissors, lizard, Spock. You’ll play against the Raspberry Pi by using
    the built-in joystick, LED matrix, and code on the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT.

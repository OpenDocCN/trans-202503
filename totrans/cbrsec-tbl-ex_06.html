<p class="CO">The most important work occurs after the conclusion of the exercise, in the evaluation phase. In this stage, you will identify and record any issues the organization should remedy. Without this follow-up, a tabletop exercise may be far less valuable.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Once the tabletop exercise concludes, you’ll need a plan to gather feedback, craft a report, and determine the next steps for the organization. This chapter will walk you through that process and various points to consider as you perform these activities.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec1"><span id="h-114"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Evaluation Requirements and Restrictions</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Before planning specific evaluation activities, the development team should take stock of any requirements or restrictions. Evaluation <i>requirements</i> could <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_104" aria-label="104"/>come from external regulatory bodies (such as a state insurance commission) or be contractual (such as an agreement with a vendor or outside party). An organization’s cyber insurance carrier, for example, may state that in order to maintain coverage or see a favorable premium, the organization must conduct a tabletop exercise on an annual basis and document it with a report containing the scenario outline, attendees, and key recommendations. Alternatively, the organization’s risk management team may require that the development team create a report with identified recommendations, named stakeholders, and parties responsible for addressing any shortcomings.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">The development team also needs to be aware of any legal <i>restrictions</i> imposed on the evaluation process. For example, the legal team may express reservations about putting certain information in writing. If sensitive data were stolen during a cybersecurity incident and there was a written document citing a high likelihood of this data being stolen, it could create a legal risk. For this reason (among others), the development team should confer with the organization’s legal resources to understand any requirements or restrictions prior to creating any documentation.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec2"><span id="h-115"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Choosing an Evaluator</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Prior to the tabletop exercise, the development team should choose someone to oversee the evaluation phase and identify the recommendations to include in the report. This evaluator should understand a variety of organizational functions, as the event will likely reveal shortcomings that span multiple roles. For example, <a href="#tab5-1">Table 5-1</a> lists potential issues that a single cybersecurity tabletop exercise could uncover, as well as the teams that would most likely be responsible for addressing them.</p>&#13;

<p class="TX">In many tabletop exercises, a member of the development team, such as the development lead or facilitator, functions as the evaluator.</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="NOTE"><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="NOTE-TXT"><i>This chapter assumes that the facilitator is also functioning as the evaluator, as this is most often the case.</i></p>&#13;
<p class="TX">In organizations with resources to bear, a member of the risk management or audit team can take on this role. Risk management, which is <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_105" aria-label="105"/>normally tasked with identifying and addressing risks across the organization, is a logical choice for the evaluation, as each finding is a risk that could impact the company’s ability to respond to a cybersecurity incident. Audit would be another logical choice: some of the findings may highlight deviations from policies (or the lack of an established policy) that need to be addressed.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Unfortunately, organizations with constrained resources might not be able to include additional personnel or might lack risk management and audit roles.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec3"><span id="h-116"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Evaluation Methods</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">This section describes several common methods of evaluation. Each organization has its own goals and objectives, however, so be sure to account for those when determining which methods to use.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Ideally, the evaluator should present a road map of these activities at the beginning of the tabletop exercise so attendees can understand how their comments will be used and what the overall evaluation process will be.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec4">&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec4"><span id="h-117"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Performing a Debrief</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Immediately after concluding the tabletop exercise, the evaluator should conduct a two-stage debrief: first, gathering feedback from attendees, and second, gathering feedback from select stakeholders, such as the executive sponsor or the most senior participants. While the evaluator will request additional feedback from attendees later, soliciting feedback right at the conclusion of the exercise gets people’s thoughts when the exercise is still fresh in their minds.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">For the first stage of the debrief, allot approximately 15 minutes at the end of the tabletop exercise for an open discussion about the recommendations discussed in the tabletop exercise. If the attendees are tired and not contributing, the evaluator can recap some of the issues that emerged, then ask them to confirm that those issues are indeed valid. This serves as a way to check that the evaluator’s initial observations are apt before they make their way into a report.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">The second stage—in which the facilitator meets with the executive sponsor, high-ranking attendees, and other prominent participants—is an opportunity to gather additional feedback from a smaller and more select group of participants. This is especially important for external facilitators, as it offers a more intimate setting for feedback that may not be appropriate for all attendees.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">In both stages, the facilitator has an opportunity to advocate for the interests of the participants. For example, if a discussion point revealed that the organization doesn’t maintain key logs longer than 10 days and an attendee has continually advocated for funds to increase log retention, the facilitator can reinforce this recommendation in the final report. Alternatively, staff members may have repeatedly stated that they lacked <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_106" aria-label="106"/>training to better respond to cybersecurity events, in which case the facilitator can advocate for more training.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec5"><span id="h-118"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Sending a Survey</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Within 24 hours of the tabletop exercise—when participants have had some time to reflect on the event, but it’s still fresh in their minds—send them a survey via email. The purpose of this survey is partly to obtain data on the perceived efficacy of the facilitator and format, and partly to gather any thoughts participants didn’t share either because there wasn’t enough time or because they didn’t feel comfortable. The survey should allow attendees to provide additional comments and should take no more than five minutes to complete. It can also anonymize feedback to elicit more candid comments.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">The following box includes sample survey questions we’ve used during an exercise. For an additional sample, see the Sample Evaluation Form found in NIST SP 800-84, <i>Guide to Test, Training, and Exercise Programs for IT Plans and Capabilities</i> (<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-84/final"><i>https://<wbr/>csrc<wbr/>.nist<wbr/>.gov<wbr/>/publications<wbr/>/detail<wbr/>/sp<wbr/>/800<wbr/>-84<wbr/>/final</i></a>).</p>&#13;
<aside class="box1" aria-labelledby="box-13">&#13;
<h5 class="BT" id="box-13"><span class="SANS_Dogma_OT_Bold_B_11">SAMPLE SURVEY QUESTIONS</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Your survey might ask participants to rate the effectiveness of the exercise and the facilitator, then rank the following statements from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree):</span></p>&#13;
<ol class="NL">&#13;
<li class="BNL" value="1"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">The tabletop exercise was relevant to my role.</span></li>&#13;

<li class="BNL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">My participation in the exercise was warranted.</span></li>&#13;
<li class="BNL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">The facilitator kept the exercise on track.</span></li>&#13;
<li class="BNL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">The facilitator was well prepared.</span></li>&#13;
<li class="BNL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">If invited, I would participate in future tabletop exercises.</span></li>&#13;

<li class="BNL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">The exercise helped me better understand the incident response plan.</span></li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">You might also solicit short, free-form responses to questions like the following:</span></p>&#13;
<ol class="NL">&#13;
<li class="BNL" value="1"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">How could the organization better prepare for future tabletop exercises?</span></li>&#13;
<li class="BNL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Are there ways the organization could improve its response to a cybersecurity incident that weren’t discussed in the exercise?</span></li>&#13;
<li class="BNL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Is there any other feedback you would like to share?</span></li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
</aside>&#13;
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_107" aria-label="107"/>To encourage a higher response rate, the executive sponsor could be the one to send out the survey. Alternatively, you could offer the survey on paper at the conclusion of the exercise, but at that point, attendees may be fatigued and less likely to provide quality feedback. Completing a survey in person removes a degree of anonymity, which can be a negative when you’re attempting to collect potentially critical feedback.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec6"><span id="h-119"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Reporting Conventions</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Reporting provides proof that a tabletop exercise occurred. It may enable the organization to meet a compliance requirement or document the deficiencies or concerns identified during the exercise. This section outlines two types of reports you might create: a statement of completion and a full report.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Because these reports may be reviewed by a wide audience, ranging from an information security manager to a member of the board, they must demonstrate a high level of professionalism. To generate them, the development team should consult with the executive sponsor and legal counsel. The reports should be based entirely on facts derived from the exercise. If appropriate, they can contain direct quotes from attendees, along with recommendations grounded in best standards.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">While exceptionally rare, organizations occasionally choose to forgo reporting due to budget or time restrictions or to avoid documenting tabletop exercise activities in writing. However, the benefits of reporting far outweigh the possible downsides. Even the most informal exercise will benefit from a brief statement of completion (described next), so we don’t recommend forgoing this step.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec7">&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec7"><span id="h-120"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Statement of Completion</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Instead of a full report, an organization might create a bare-bones document memorializing a tabletop exercise, usually called a <i>statement of completion</i>. This document is nothing more than a synopsis of basic facts, including:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Logistical information such as the date, location, and duration of the exercise</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">A list of attendees and their titles</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">A brief description of the scenario discussed</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">A summary stating that the tabletop exercise was completed</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">This document, which is usually no more than two pages long, functions as proof that a tabletop exercise was performed in the event that vendors, cyber insurance underwriters, or other interested parties request such documentation.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Note that the statement of completion lacks any observations—positive or negative—drawn from the tabletop exercise. More often than not, this is <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_108" aria-label="108"/>by design: the organization may not want to memorialize its shortcomings for an interested external party and give them cause for concern.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Some organizations create two reports: a statement of completion and a more traditional report providing greater details that may be subject to legal and information-sharing restrictions. This allows the organization to prove to outside parties that a tabletop exercise occurred (via the statement of completion) while also providing recommendations and other opinions internally (in the detailed, protected report).</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">The <a href="appendix.xhtml">appendix</a> provides an example statement of completion.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec8">&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec8"><span id="h-121"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Full Report</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Most tabletop exercises yield a full report, which provides a full description of the exercise you conducted. In addition to the items included in the statement of completion, this comprehensive report typically contains:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">An executive summary</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">A description of the scenario, including a breakdown of the scenario injects</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Specific identified deficiencies with their corresponding impacts and recommendations</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">If the evaluator is qualified to do so and the organization requests it, you could include the evaluator’s opinion of whether the organization is prepared to address a scenario like the one explored in the exercise. However, this opinion should be built on solid ground and unquestionable to the reader.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">While a tabletop exercise report length varies greatly based on the complexity of the scenario, the number of injects, and the number of recommendations, it is normally 5 to 10 pages. The reader should be able to quickly understand any identified deficiencies, so it can be helpful to break down each one into three subsections: Findings and Observations, Impact, and Recommendations.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec9">&#13;
<h5 class="H3" id="sec9"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Findings and Observations</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">The report should contain specific findings and observations. These could come from the evaluator in addition to the other parties who participated in the tabletop exercise, including the executive sponsor, scribe, and observers. However, the evaluator should be the ultimate arbiter of the report’s contents.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX"><i>Findings</i> consist of any unexpected events that occurred during the tabletop exercise. For example, based on the organization’s documentation, the development team may have expected attendees to notify the legal team when a set of facts was conveyed; however, this did not occur during the exercise. In this case, the finding would be that the attendees deviated from a documented process.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX"><i>Observations</i> are broader notes about topics that generated in-depth discussions or weren’t fully explored. For example, an observation may be that <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_109" aria-label="109"/>attendees weren’t sure if a particular vendor needed to be notified based on a set of known facts. While they ultimately chose not to notify the vendor, a decision that aligned with organizational process, the evaluator may believe the issue warrants further examination.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">You should make clear how each finding and observation came to be included in the report. In other words, provide the context for how the issue emerged during the discussion. For example, if a report contained a finding stating that the organization maintained network logs for only 30 days versus the 90 days required by policy, it would be helpful to document that this issue emerged during a discussion about the organization’s ability to investigate contractual requirements with a key vendor.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">As an evaluator, you must also be prepared for people to dispute the facts presented in the report. To avoid this, you must ensure that all findings and observations are completely accurate and grounded in fact. You could use direct quotes from the exercise to reinforce your claim. Also, because some of the findings and observations may relate to highly technical or complicated processes, you should confer with subject matter experts to ensure that terminology, process, and jargon portray an accurate picture.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Finally, the findings and observation subsection should contain only content directly emanating from the tabletop exercise. Take care to avoid merging it with the impact or recommendations subsections.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec10">&#13;
<h5 class="H3" id="sec10"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Impact</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">After each finding or observation, the report should clearly articulate its impact. The impact conveys the importance of highlighting the item in the report.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Where possible, the evaluator should identify the greatest possible business impact for the organization. For example, if a network is taken offline due to a cybersecurity incident that has compromised a product-ordering system as well as automated badge-access readers for physical security, presumably the greatest business impact would be the loss of revenue resulting from the offline product-ordering system. The evaluator should avoid making fantastical claims about the impact of a particular issue, however; all statements should remain grounded in reality.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec11">&#13;
<h5 class="H3" id="sec11"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Recommendations</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">A recommendation is a short proposal for how to solve a particular problem. Often, recommendations will emerge during the tabletop exercise itself as the attendees brainstorm ways to alleviate a shortcoming. It most likely isn’t the facilitator’s role to discover a solution during the exercise, however, and the evaluator should consider whether ideas proposed by attendees appropriately address the issue.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">A recommendation does not need to solve every element of an issue. For example, it doesn’t need to factor in budget considerations, technical limitations, or in-depth exploration of other issues; these are for another day. It does, however, need to be realistic. Where possible, the recommendation <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_110" aria-label="110"/>should also be grounded in standards. Citing a standard (for example, NIST 800-61r2) adds greater weight to an argument.</p>&#13;

<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">During a time of crisis, all members of the incident response team should know the limits of their authority, if any.

<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">In advance of an incident, the Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan should define the limitations of the incident response team, if any.

<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Involving the right people at the right time is paramount during an incident.

<p class="BH2"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Heavy_Oblique_BI_11">Recommendation</span></p>&#13;
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">At all times during an incident, the organization should clearly understand the severity level assigned to an incident (such as Low/Medium/High), and based on the incident categorization, notify a predefined list of contacts.

<p class="TNI">With the information you’ve learned during the exercise and the relationships built in the process, there are plenty of ways to make changes to the organization. This section focuses on some of the many follow-up activities that can occur after the exercise. Some of these are relatively quick, while others are part of a greater effort.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec13"><span id="h-123"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Assess the Incident Response Plan</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">A tabletop exercise focused on a cybersecurity issue is undoubtedly intertwined with the organization’s incident response plan, making this a perfect time to update that plan. Using the tabletop exercise report, stakeholders should meet and discuss the plan’s adequacy.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Prior to the tabletop exercise, the development team should identify the specific individual responsible for maintaining the incident response plan. While standards state that an incident response plan should have an owner, unfortunately it’s not uncommon for the plan’s defined owner to be “information security” or “risk management,” which diffuses responsibility. The development team can work with the plan owner while developing the scenario and invite them to be a passive participant in the exercise if they already don’t have a role.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Ideally, the organization’s incident response plan has a predefined update interval period, such as twice a year, with out-of-cycle updates occurring as needed. The findings from the tabletop may be incorporated into the next review process; if the next update interval is several months in the future or if a critical item emerged, an ad hoc update might be appropriate.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Updates to the incident response plan aren’t always arduous. Tabletop exercises might uncover several small weaknesses, such as a contact list that doesn’t include phone numbers for a key vendor or a lack of clear responsibilities. Many of these are quick fixes. If a significant item emerges, however, such as uncertainty over whether the incident response team can shut down a revenue-generating application, it’s possible the update will require input from several stakeholders.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec14"><span id="h-124"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Catalog and Update Other Documentation and Processes</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Tabletop exercises are very likely to discuss documentation beyond the incident response plan. This might include formal policies, processes, standards, technical playbooks, and network diagrams or informal documentation such as wiki pages and intranet sites.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Following the exercise, the evaluator should catalog any documentation that may require updates, as well as gaps that require new documentation. While it isn’t the evaluator’s responsibility to update each document brought up during the tabletop exercise, the owners of any discussed processes should be notified of concerns so they can address them during the next update cycle.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">The tabletop exercise’s findings might also relate to other business processes, such as those for business continuity or risk management. For example, if a medical company determines that a security incident involving a specific system has the unexpected ability to hinder the distribution of flu vaccines (a potentially serious issue during flu season), the finding would be relevant to the organization’s business impact assessment. You should weave in and communicate findings to these affected parties to increase the value of the exercise.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec15"><span id="h-125"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Conduct Follow-up Tabletop Exercises</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Depending on the deficiency identified during an exercise, the remedy may involve nothing more than a few emails, or it could take months of meetings and hard work. Once the deficiencies have been addressed, it may make sense to perform a tabletop exercise focused on the remediated issues. Performing a follow-up tabletop exercise has several benefits:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">It verifies that the implemented mitigation strategies are effective.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">It triggers the creation of a new report, which can document whether the identified deficiencies were addressed.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">It demonstrates a commitment to improvement and desire to address deficiencies.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">The follow-up exercise scenario doesn’t need to be a complete repeat of the original scenario. It can deviate somewhat, so long as it addresses the deficiencies identified in the original exercise’s report.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec16"><span id="h-126"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Implement a Formal Tabletop Exercise Program</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">If one doesn’t already exist, the development team and executive sponsor can also develop a framework for successive events. Tabletop exercises performed quarterly or twice a year likely won’t require significant planning, as each new event can be executed with a repeatable formula. You can define this tabletop exercise program in the organization’s incident response plan and schedule the plan’s update cycle to follow the tabletop exercises, for example.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Conducting regular tabletop exercises conveys to employees that incident response preparation is important to the organization’s leadership. Tabletop exercises are an investment in one of the organization’s most valuable resources: employees’ time. When tabletop exercises occur on a regular basis, participating employees can observe firsthand management’s commitment to reducing the risk posed by cybersecurity incidents.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">If the organization has defined a formal tabletop exercise program, it should be able to perform an exercise with a few days’ notice, if needed. This is extremely beneficial given that the cybersecurity threat landscape can change in a matter of hours or days due to geopolitical events, new technical exploits, or recently passed legislation. Organizations are regularly playing catch-up when responding to these landscape changes, and a tabletop exercise is one method of assessing its preparation in the face of a new threat. While details during a major event may be scarce, a snap tabletop exercise can gather key stakeholders to discuss the impact based on what is known and convey to leadership that the situation is getting due consideration.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Finally, a formalized tabletop exercise program conveys to external stakeholders that preparing for cybersecurity incidents is an important part of its information security posture. Increasingly, external stakeholders assess the cybersecurity risk of entering into a business relationship. For example, a cyber insurance underwriter will ask questions to gauge <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_114" aria-label="114"/>cybersecurity risk and determine the most appropriate insurance premium. By presenting a documented tabletop exercise program to interested parties, the organization proves it is taking cybersecurity seriously and making efforts to reduce risk.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec17"><span id="h-127"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Communicate High-Level Exercise Findings</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Leadership is increasingly concerned about the risks caused by cybersecurity threats. After the tabletop exercise, and only with the approval of the executive sponsor, consider a process to notify leadership about the exercise and brief them on the findings. The executive sponsor can provide guidance on the appropriate forum and messaging. The executive sponsor may also be the most appropriate person to inform leadership, as they’re most likely to have leadership’s trust and also most aware of the nuances to convey.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">The best way to inform leadership runs the gamut from a simple email to a presentation. Given that a tabletop exercise will likely reveal organizational deficiencies, filling them in during a remote or in-person meeting allows you to answer questions on the spot versus following up on long email strings. Plus, these valuable conversations could influence future tabletop exercises.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">It may also be prudent to share some information about the tabletop exercise—such as the fact that it occurred, the topic, and high-level findings—with the organization’s employees. Communicating this information during a regularly scheduled event, such as a quarterly all-hands call, helps reaffirm to employees that preparing for a cybersecurity incident is important to the organization. Selectively sharing a few identified shortcomings and the actions taken to remediate them will also demonstrate that the organization is making improvements as a result of the tabletop exercise. Take care to do this in conjunction with internal communications processes and in consultation with leadership and the executive sponsor. Above all, do not assign blame.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Lastly, if risk management or audit team members were unable to participate in the tabletop exercise, you may want to provide them with a copy of the report (after securing permission from the executive sponsor). Ideally, the report will demonstrate the value of the exercise and encourage these teams to participate in future events.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec18"><span id="h-128"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Identify and Analyze Trends</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Once an organization has performed several tabletop exercises, it should have documentation about numerous deficiencies and recommendations, which gives it the opportunity to look for any trends across scenarios. For example, say that 7 out of 10 exercises mention that participants were confused about their responsibilities during a cybersecurity incident; this trend may point to a systemic issue that needs to be addressed. Because it’s easy to focus on a singular report after a tabletop exercise, it’s easy to miss the forest for the trees. Examining the reports together may reveal key information.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec19"><span id="h-129"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Summary</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Some of the most valuable benefits of a tabletop exercise come after the last attendee leaves the room. By documenting the results of the exercise, an organization can prioritize action items, communicate findings with stakeholders, track improvements, and maximize the event’s value.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec20"><span id="h-130"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Questions</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">You should understand how to evaluate the success of your tabletop exercise in advance of the event. Contemplate the following questions to decide what you’ll do when the event wraps up and the organization looks to improve.</p>&#13;
<ol class="NL">&#13;
<li class="NL" value="1">What are your evaluation requirements? Does a business partner, insurance provider, or other interested party expect a report?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">Are there any reporting restrictions?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">What type of report will you create?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">Who will you designate as the evaluator (the person who oversees the reporting)?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">Has anyone been tasked with addressing deficiencies, such as members of the audit or risk management teams?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">How will participants provide feedback immediately after the tabletop exercise and in the following days?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">How will you share the results with leadership?</li>&#13;

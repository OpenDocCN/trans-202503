    of the GIMP interface. In this chapter, we go into more detail. GIMP is a powerful,
    flexible application. A casual user can edit images without learning much about
    GIMP, but by digging a little deeper, you can better control your images and work
    more quickly and efficiently.

    images more effectively. If you’re switching from another image-editing application,
    this chapter teaches you the new language of GIMP. As of version 2.8, the GIMP
    interface has changed significantly, so even if you already know version 2.4 or
    2.6, read this chapter carefully to learn about the differences in the new version.

    each version of GIMP and is a quick way to check which version is currently installed
    on your computer. The splash also displays updates on the loading process. When
    the splash window disappears, GIMP’s three main windows appear. By default, these
    windows appear as shown in [Figure 9-1](ch09s01.html#gimpapostrophes_initial_windows_displaye
    "Figure 9-1. GIMP’s initial windows displayed in multi-window mode"). If your
    screen is smaller than 1440 × 900 pixels, the two vertical windows will be shorter.
    If your screen is significantly larger, you’ll see more space between the three
    windows. Because these are three separate windows, you’ll also see your desktop
    in the background.

    and even many GNU/Linux applications (like GNU Paint, Blender, Inkscape, or OpenOffice
    Draw), always use *single-window mode*. Multi-window mode doesn’t work well in
    the Windows environment and has been a source of complaint about GIMP among Windows
    users. GIMP 2.8 also offers single-window mode, which we describe in [Single-Window
    Mode](ch09s01.html#single-window_mode "Single-Window Mode"). For now, let’s focus
    on the classic multi-window mode. Most of the explanations that follow, however,
    also apply to single-window mode.

    the height and width of the two vertical windows, and when you quit GIMP, the
    changes are saved. [Figure 9-2](ch09s01.html#custom_screen_layout "Figure 9-2. A
    custom screen layout") shows a custom screen layout, where the two vertical windows
    are placed on the right side of the screen. The `Toolbox - Tool Options` window
    (also called the Toolbox dialog) is on the far right, and we’ve increased its
    width a little, so each row at the top contains six icons instead of five. To
    its left is the multi-dialog window, which contains several dialogs, organized
    into two sets of tabs.

    once you open an image in GIMP and is labeled with the name of the image and other
    basic information about the image. This window also contains the menu bar (unless
    you’re running Ubuntu’s Unity interface or Mac OS X).

    head. Wilber is the GIMP mascot, so you’ll see him all over GIMP. The top of Image
    window contains a menu bar with 11 or 12 entries, depending on whether you have
    the GAP plug-in installed. If you leave the mouse pointer in this window (or in
    the Wilber strip at the top of the Toolbox), you see a message that says “Drop

    end up with over a dozen windows open at once. Although this can get confusing,
    the benefit is that GIMP allows you to do many things simultaneously, rather than
    forcing you to cancel one operation before trying another.

    was unable to represent layers, a warning message was displayed, but after that,
    the image was saved without the layers. With version 2.8, you can save only in
    the XCF format, GIMP’s native format, which can represent all the information
    contained in an image, including paths, layers, and layer groups. You can export
    an image in a variety of formats, but unless you save in XCF, some information
    will be lost, and GIMP warns you before closing the image. For example, if you
    add a legend to a photo, saving it as XCF saves the new text layer added for the
    legend. Thus you can later change the text of the legend or its presentation,
    which would be impossible in a JPEG image in which the text layer would be merged

    the image. ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1453862.png.jpg) is the shortcut
    for undo, and ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1453864.png.jpg) is the
    shortcut for redo. Even if a transformation or filter was processor intensive,
    undoing and redoing are not.

- en: If you undo something and then change the image, you cannot redo the operation.
    The undo history is like a path that forks every time you make a change to the
    image. If you turn around and go back (using undo) and then make a change, you
    are heading down a new fork, and the steps you took along the previous path are
    lost.

- en: Some operations cannot be undone, especially those dealing with saving and loading
    an image. If you save an image, close it, and then reload it, the undo history
    is lost. Reverting an image closes the image and then reloads it, so reverting
    cannot be undone.

- en: Some complicated selection tools, like the Scissors Select tool or the Free
    Select tool, don’t allow you to undo while building a selection. You can undo
    the selection when you’ve completed it, but you cannot undo a step during its
    construction.

- en: Most filters and plug-ins have full undo capabilities, but some external plug-ins
    don’t work properly and can even corrupt the undo history. Canceling a plug-in
    while it’s running can also corrupt the undo history.

- en: 'The FADE entry in the Edit menu is usually grayed out. Fade is only available
    after you’ve just used the Bucket Fill tool, the Blend tool, or a few of the filters.
    Its dialog is shown in [Figure 9-56](ch09s05.html#fade_dialog "Figure 9-56. The
    Fade dialog"). Fade modifies the blending mode and the opacity of the last operation.
    For example, after applying the Bucket Fill tool in normal mode with full opacity,
    you can change the mode to Screen and reduce the opacity using Fade. Since fading
    is a modification, Fade doesn’t add a step to the undo history. Unlike most things
    in GIMP, Fade is blocking: Once you begin, you must either fade or cancel. You
    can’t do something else and then return to the Fade dialog.'

    are available only for painting tools, and REPLACE, ERASE, and ANTI ERASE. The
    effect of the mode and the opacity can be seen immediately, but the effects become
    permanent only when you click the FADE button.

    the actions that you can undo. The first state of the image is at the top of the
    list, and the last one that can be restored is at the bottom. If you click a state,
    it becomes the current one.

<blockquote class="Epigraph" epub:type="epigraph">&#13;
<p class="Epigraph">For a shinobi, it is essential to know the proper time. It always should be when the enemy is tired or has let their guard down.</p>&#13;
<p class="EpigraphSource">—Yoshimori Hyakushu #5</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="ChapterIntro">When planning theft, espionage, sabotage, assassination, or other attacks, shinobi were not burdened by the spirit of good sportsmanship or fair play. To the contrary, they carefully considered the most “advisable times and advantageous positions”<sup class="endnote"><a id="c06-noteref-45" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-45">1</a></sup> to strike. The <em>Shoninki </em>stresses the importance of waiting to infiltrate until a target is distracted, lethargic, likely to be hasty in judgment, drinking and carousing, or simply exhausted; <em>Yoshimori Hyakushu</em> poem 63 states that one’s tiredness “could be the cause of a serious blunder.”<sup class="endnote"><a id="c06-noteref-46" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-46">2</a></sup> Shinobi were keen observers of such behavior and would often infiltrate when an enemy was cutting down trees, focused on setting up their own position, feeling tired after a fight, or changing guards.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c06-noteref-47" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-47">3</a></sup></p>&#13;
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="50" id="Page_50"/>In studying their enemies’ behavior, shinobi noticed that predictable human routines created windows of opportunity for attack. The scrolls divide the day into two-hour blocks and recommend planning infiltration during the blocks that tend to align with waking, eating, and sleeping. The appropriate hour depends on the type of attack. Night attacks, for instance, are best undertaken during the hours of the Boar (9:00 <span class="KeyCaps">pm</span>–11:00 <span class="KeyCaps">pm</span>), the Rat (11:00 <span class="KeyCaps">pm</span>–1:00 <span class="KeyCaps">am</span>), and the Hare (5:00 <span class="KeyCaps">am</span>–7:00 <span class="KeyCaps">am</span>), animals of the Chinese zodiac.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c06-noteref-48" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-48">4</a></sup></p>&#13;
<p>In addition, <em>Bansenshūkai</em> notes that some generals believed in “lucky days,”<sup class="endnote"><a id="c06-noteref-49" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-49">5</a></sup> divined through Chinese astrology. On these dates, attacks were thought predestined for victory. If shinobi could identify enemy commanders who believed these superstitions, they could use that information—for example, by predicting troop movements based on what the commander believed to be a lucky or unlucky day to leave camp. When it comes to predictable patterns of behavior, not much has changed. In this chapter, we’ll discuss how the cyber equivalents of time-scheduled events can be targeted by threat actors.  </p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-500549c06-0001">Understanding Time and Opportunities</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Because people still rise, work, eat, relax, and sleep on roughly the same schedule as the feudal Japanese, the hours of infiltration suggested by the scrolls align closely with when employees are distracted, exhausted, or made careless by the challenges of a modern workday—in other words, the times they’re most vulnerable to attack. Consider the scrolls’ time blocks in the context of network and information system activity and usage patterns:</p>&#13;
<ol class="none">&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Hour of the Hare (5:00 <span class="KeyCaps">am</span>–7:00 <span class="KeyCaps">am</span>)</span>  Users wake up and log in for the first time that day. Automated and manual systems boot up, causing spikes in event logs and syslogs.</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Hour of the Horse (11:00 <span class="KeyCaps">am</span>–1:00 <span class="KeyCaps">pm</span>)</span>  Many users take lunch breaks, meaning they log out of their systems or are timed out for being idle. They may also surf the web for personal reasons—they read the news, shop, check personal email, post to social media, or perform other activities that might trigger anomaly detection systems.</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Hour of the Cock (5:00 <span class="KeyCaps">pm</span>–7:00 <span class="KeyCaps">pm</span>)</span>  Users find stopping points for their work. They save files and perhaps rush to finish, greatly increasing the risk of making mistakes in both their work and their cybersecurity vigilance. For example, a worker might unthinkingly open an attachment from an email that seems urgent. Users log out of <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="51" id="Page_51"/>accounts and systems en masse, but some are simply abandoned, left to time out and disconnect.</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Hour of the Boar (9:00 <span class="KeyCaps">pm</span>–11:00 <span class="KeyCaps">pm</span>)</span>  Most users are away from work. Whether they’re at home, out socializing, or getting ready for bed, the security of their work accounts and systems is probably not at the front of their minds. Organizations with staffed overnight SOC coverage typically see a shift change during this time, creating a window for attackers to strike between user logins or while SOC users are getting up to speed for the evening. The later the hour, the greater the possibility that users—even those used to late hours—get sleepy or let their guard down because things seem quiet.</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Hour of the Rat (11:00 <span class="KeyCaps">pm</span>–1:00 <span class="KeyCaps">am</span>)</span>  Networks and systems run backups or other scheduled maintenance, generating noise in network sensors and SIEMs. SOC users might have completed their daily security and maintenance tasks and could be immersed in project work.</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Hour of the Tiger (3:00 <span class="KeyCaps">am</span>–5:00 <span class="KeyCaps">am</span>)</span>  Batch jobs, including processing log files, running diagnostics, and initiating software builds, typically execute during this time. Aside from SOC personnel, most users sink into the deepest part of their sleep cycle and are not active on their accounts.</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Lucky Days</span>  There are also specific days, weeks, and months when adversaries are likely to target systems and users. While most organizational leaders don’t base activity on “lucky days,” threat actors are certainly aware of regularly scheduled upgrades or maintenance, when organizations take their defenses offline, and of three-day weekends and company holidays, when systems and accounts go largely unchecked. If potential threats have not been considered, irregularities in network traffic and system logs could go unnoticed during these windows of opportunity, allowing adversaries to conduct attacks, perform reconnaissance or command and control (C2) communication, spread malware, or execute data exfiltration.</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-500549c06-0002">Developing Time-Based Security Controls and Anomaly Detectors</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">You can use the framework of the shinobi’s hours of infiltration to develop time-based security that takes into account the baseline states <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="52" id="Page_52"/>of the network at various times, deviations from baseline, and business requirements. Applying time-based security is broadly achieved through three steps:</p>&#13;
<ol class="decimal">&#13;
<li value="1">Determine the activity baseline for each hour. </li>&#13;
<li value="2">Train personnel to monitor activity and become very familiar with typical activity during their assigned hours.</li>&#13;
<li value="3">Assess the business needs for each hour. Based on this assessment, create business logic and security axioms to further mitigate threats and detect anomalies.</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p>First, consider dividing your network and system logs into one- or two-hour segments. Review the historical trends and activity levels of your network and systems to establish a baseline, a critical metric for threat hunting and identifying cyberhygiene issues. Pay special attention to times when attacks have occurred, as well as times that may be routinely vulnerable to attack as determined by the organization’s circumstances, threat modeling, and experience.</p>&#13;
<p>Once all the data has been segmented and baselined, train analysts, system administrators, and security professionals to become extremely familiar with your network’s activity patterns. They should also be aware of the security gaps that organizational routines create. The shinobi scrolls instruct guards to scrutinize every irregularity and incongruity during their shift. For instance, they are expected to notice when a fisherman arrives later than normal or if an unfamiliar bird calls at an odd hour. Having security personnel similarly attuned to incongruities could prompt them to look twice at an abnormal event, which could reveal a security incident. Developing this deep expertise might require assigning security to monitor a sector—for instance, a single system that is considered a likely target—become extremely familiar with it, and then review every log and event from that system for a two-hour time frame during their eight-hour shift. This strategy is in stark contrast to the “monitor everything at all times” mentality of most SOCs—a mentality that causes alert fatigue, overload, and burnout. It should also mitigate the problems of many automated anomaly detection systems, which need a human to follow up on every anomaly and provide feedback and investigation. These systems quickly become overwhelming and the data inscrutable to security personnel who review anomalies on a daily or weekly basis.  </p>&#13;
<p>Note that security logs are not ephemeral, like sounds in the night, but are available for future analysis. It is plausible that a sophisticated adversary might alter or eliminate security logs, filter traffic from network taps and sensors, or otherwise compromise the systems intended to log their <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="53" id="Page_53"/>intrusion and alert security. However, these actions should disrupt a system’s normal behavior enough that an astute security analyst takes notice.</p>&#13;
<p>Next, you will want to ask yourself two questions:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>When are your users and systems active?</li>&#13;
<li>When could the adversary be active?</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p>Understanding how and when users log into and operate your systems helps you strategically constrain access, making it more difficult for an external or internal threat to infiltrate at your most vulnerable times. For example, if a system is not in use between 8:00 <span class="KeyCaps">pm</span> and 8:00 <span class="KeyCaps">am</span>, turn off that system during those hours. If users have no business need to access their systems on Saturdays, then disable access to those systems for all users on Saturdays. Disabling systems at scheduled times also helps train your SOC staff to detect anomalies during specific hours, as there will be fewer alerts and systems to review. NIST standards suggest implementing such access controls, but many organizations choose instead to prioritize certain scenarios for operational convenience in emergencies, however unlikely these occurrences may be.</p>&#13;

<h2>Castle Theory Thought Exercise</h2>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Consider this scenario: you are the ruler of a medieval castle with valuable information, treasure, and people inside. You receive credible intelligence that a shinobi plans to infiltrate your castle. Imagine that your guards have perfect knowledge of time but can enforce only the following rules:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>When any gate or door (interior or exterior) can be locked and unlocked</li>&#13;
<li>Curfews, after which anyone found in the halls will be detained</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p>Consider what level of integrity, assurance, and security you might achieve with the strict exercise of only those two time-based controls. How would you train castle residents to operate within these strictures (how will they use latrines at night, clean the premises while others sleep, take night deliveries, and so on)? What compromises do you expect to make for your security controls to be functional?</p>&#13;
<p>For this exercise, it is useful to draw a map of the imaginary castle or your office building. Or you can use an abstracted layout of your network map or data-flow diagram (DFD) as a “building,” where switches are hallways, routers/firewalls are doors, systems are rooms, and VPNs/egress points are gates.</p>&#13;

<h2 id="h1-500549c06-0003"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="54" id="Page_54"/>Recommended Security Controls and Mitigations</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Where relevant, recommendations are presented with an applicable security control from the NIST 800-53 standard. Each should be evaluated with the idea of hours of infiltration in mind. (Note that applications of these techniques require that logs and alerts have timestamps and that time across all systems be in sync. See AU-8: Time Stamps.)</p>&#13;
<ol class="decimal">&#13;
<li value="1">Evaluate your hours of operation and perform threat modeling. When are you most vulnerable to attack? What can you do to train your staff to be prepared? [NIST SP 800-154: Guide to Data-Centric System Threat Modeling]<sup class="endnote"><a id="c06-noteref-50" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-50">6</a></sup></li>&#13;
<li value="2">Implement time-based privilege controls on accounts based on users’ business and operational needs. For example, restrict certain users’ ability to send or receive work email after 7:00 <span class="KeyCaps">pm</span>. [AC-2: Account Management | (6) Dynamic Privilege Management]</li>&#13;
<li value="3">Restrict the ability to log into or use specific accounts during certain hours. For example, when there is an attempt to perform unauthorized actions on an inactive account between 9:00 <span class="KeyCaps">pm</span> and 11:00 <span class="KeyCaps">pm</span>, alert the user immediately to verify their identity. If they are unresponsive or their authentication fails, alert the SOC. [AC-2: Account Management | (11) Usage Conditions]</li>&#13;
<li value="4">Leverage heuristic analysis systems to detect abnormal system access or usage patterns during set times. Users should voluntarily document and provide insight into their “typical usage” patterns to help model their expected behavior during their workday. [AC-2: Account Management | (12) Account monitoring for A-typical Usage]</li>&#13;
<li value="5">Require system owners and users to document when systems are expected to be in use and when they could be powered off. [AC-3: Access Enforcement | (5) Security Relevant Information]</li>&#13;
<li value="6">Shrink the time frame during which adversaries can operate. Define a strategic enterprise policy whereby sensitive or proprietary information should be accessed only during set times—for instance, between 11:00 <span class="KeyCaps">am</span> and 3:00 <span class="KeyCaps">pm</span> on weekdays. [AC-17: Remote Access | (9) Disconnect/Disable Access]</li>&#13;
<li value="7">Inform the account holder when they have successfully or unsuccessfully logged in, including the time and date of last login. Tracking this information helps a user alert the SOC if their account has been compromised and tell the SOC when the <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="55" id="Page_55"/>unauthorized access occurred. [AC-9: Previous Login (Access) Notification | (4) Additional Logon Information]</li>&#13;
<li value="8">After establishing times of operation, configure user devices and systems to automatically lock at a specified time, terminating all sessions. [AC-11: Session Lock]</li>&#13;
<li value="9">Document a policy that communicates the times and dates that changes to infrastructure and systems are allowed. This assists the SOC when evaluating network and configuration changes on an hour-by-hour basis. [AU-12: Audit Generation | (1) System Wide and Time Audit Correlation Trail; CM-5: Access Restrictions for Change]</li>&#13;

<h2 id="h1-500549c06-0004">Debrief</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">In this chapter, you learned about the traditional Japanese time based on Chinese zodiac animals, Chinese astrology’s influence on divination, and how shinobi likely used these to seize opportunities to infiltrate or outmaneuver a target. You have considered how network activity may vary depending on the time of day and how you can reduce attack opportunity through time-based controls. You became familiar with the shinobi’s security standard. Specifically, you learned that a security guard was expected to notice the smallest incongruity in their scanning sector—anything that might indicate the presence of an adversary. In addition, you reviewed guidance on how to apply some of these concepts to your threat hunting, security operation processes, and anomaly detection systems.</p>&#13;
<p>In the next chapter, we will review an application of time confidentiality, keeping the time a secret from malware, which may allow defenders to exercise particular detection and defense options. </p>&#13;

<p class="ChapterIntro">The I<sup>2</sup>C bus’s 112 nonreserved peripheral addresses are more than enough for almost any system; you’ll reach bus capacitance limits long before you put this many devices on the bus. However, since devices tend to hard-code their addresses into the hardware, only a limited number of identical devices can appear on the same I<sup>2</sup>C bus. Furthermore, because hundreds or thousands of I<sup>2</sup>C peripherals exist, there are often address conflicts between different I<sup>2</sup>C devices. The 10-bit addressing scheme was created to alleviate this problem, but few devices and fewer controllers take advantage of this feature. If you want to put two devices with the same address on the I<sup>2</sup>C bus, you’ll need to use an I<sup>2</sup>C bus expander.</p>&#13;
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_254" title="254"/>I<sup>2</sup>C <em>bus expanders</em>, also known as <em>bus multiplexers</em> or <em>bus switches</em>, allow you to switch a single I<sup>2</sup>C bus between two, four, or eight separate I<sup>2</sup>C buses. In sum, you program one of these multiplexers to switch an incoming pair of I<sup>2</sup>C lines to one of the sets of lines the IC supports. Common I<sup>2</sup>C multiplexer ICs include:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>TCA9543A: Switches one I<sup>2</sup>C bus between two separate buses</li>&#13;
<li>TCA9545A: Switches one I<sup>2</sup>C bus between four separate buses</li>&#13;
<li>TCA9548A: Switches one I<sup>2</sup>C bus between eight separate buses</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p>This chapter focuses on the TCA9548A IC, since it supports the greatest number of buses. Both Adafruit and SparkFun provide breakout boards for it, which this chapter also discusses.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-502468c12-0001">	12.1	The TCA9548A I<sup>2</sup>C Multiplexer</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">The TCA9548A is, perhaps, the most popular I<sup>2</sup>C multiplexer used by hobbyists because several manufacturers provide breakout boards for it. Therefore, the remainder of this chapter will discuss that particular device (the TCA9543A and TCA9545A devices provide a subset of the TCA9548A’s capabilities, so studying the latter will tell you most of what you need to know concerning these other devices). The following subsections describe connecting devices, programming the register set, and programming the TCA9548A.</p>&#13;
<p>The TCA9548A contains nine (SDA, SCL) pairs on the chip. The datasheet names the main lines from the controller device (SDA, SCL) and names the other eight pairs (SD0, SC0), (SD1, SC1), . . . , (SD7, SC7). </p>&#13;
<h3 id="h2-502468c12-0001">12.1.1	Upstream and Downstream Devices</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Devices on the same I<sup>2</sup>C bus as the TCA9548A are called <em>upstream devices</em> because they are on the main I<sup>2</sup>C bus before any of the switched I<sup>2</sup>C buses. Those switched buses are <em>downstream</em> from the TCA9548A. Upstream devices respond to addresses directly from the controller device, without any switching (or masking) on the part of the multiplexer. Therefore, if an upstream device shares the same address as a downstream device, the two devices will have an address conflict when the TCA9548A switches on the bus to which the downstream device is connected.</p>&#13;
<p>The TCA9548A is a device on the I<sup>2</sup>C bus, meaning it can appear on the same physical SDA and SCL lines as other devices (see <a href="#figure12-1" id="figureanchor12-1">Figure 12-1</a>). I will refer to the main lines as the <em>upstream</em> pair and the remaining eight sets of lines as the <em>downstream</em> pairs. </p>&#13;
<p>Each of the downstream (SDA, SCL) pairs forms its own I<sup>2</sup>C bus, which can be operated independently of the other seven downstream pairs. By switching the upstream lines to one of the downstream pairs (under program control), a system with a TCA9548A can expand a single I<sup>2</sup>C bus into eight.</p>&#13;

<h3 id="h2-502468c12-0002">12.1.2	The TCA9548A Selection Register</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">The TCA9548A is one of the simpler I<sup>2</sup>C devices from a software perspective. The device has one 8-bit read/write register that appears at its I<sup>2</sup>C address. Writing data to the device selects which output bus to use; reading from the device reads the last value written to it (0 is written to the register on power-up).</p>&#13;
<p>The register on the TCA9548A is a bit map used to select which downstream pairs connect to the upstream bus. A 1 in bit position 0 connects the upstream (SDA, SCL) lines to (SD0, SC0), a 1 in bit position 1 connects (SDA, SCL) to (SD1, SC1) and so on. A 1 in bit position 7 connects (SDA, SCL) to (SD7, SC7). </p>&#13;
<p>Though it’s possible to write multiple 1 bits to various positions in the TCA9548A register, you normally wouldn’t want to do this, since it could produce conflicts on the I<sup>2</sup>C bus if it attempts to simultaneously access two different devices. One reason for writing multiple 1 bits to the register is to send a general call command to devices on all the downstream buses. However, most of the time, you should ensure that you write only a single 1 bit to the register. Note that writing all 0s to the register is reasonable: doing so turns off all the downstream pairs, in which case the controller can talk only to devices that are upstream of the TCA9548A (that is, on the main, or upstream, SDA and SCL lines).</p>&#13;
<h3 id="h2-502468c12-0003">12.1.3	TCA9548A Address and Reset Lines</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">The TCA9548A can respond to an I<sup>2</sup>C address in the range 0x70 through 0x77. The chip has three address lines (A0, A1, and A2) that can be tied <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_256" title="256"/>to Gnd or Vcc to select the address (the TCA9548A uses A0, A1, and A2 as the LO 3 bits of its address). This chapter will generally assume that the TCA9548A is configured for address 0x70, unless otherwise specified. To write to the on-board register, simply write a byte to the TCA9548A’s address on the I<sup>2</sup>C bus.</p>&#13;
<p>In addition to the three address lines and the main (upstream) SDA and SCL lines, the TCA9548A has one other important input: reset. Briefly pulling the reset line low will reset the device (writing a 0 to the internal register). The datasheet claims that you can use this line to recover from a bus fault condition. Generally, you would connect this reset line to a digital I/O pin on your CPU or simply tie it high (typically through a 10-kΩ pullup resistor).</p>&#13;
<h3 id="h2-502468c12-0004">12.1.4	The TCA9548A Power Supply, Pullups, and Level Shifting</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">The TCA9548A operates off any voltage in the range 1.65 V to 5.0 V, so it works with 1.8-V, 2.5-V, 3.3-V, or 5-V logic. All the pins are 5-V tolerant regardless of the power supply voltage, meaning you can use the TCA9548A as an I<sup>2</sup>C level shifter.</p>&#13;

<div class="top hr"><hr/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<section class="note">&#13;
<h2><span class="NoteHead">Note</span></h2>&#13;
<p>	The datasheet limits the device to 3.6 V for extreme temperature use.</p>&#13;
<div class="bottom hr"><hr/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</section>&#13;
</aside>&#13;
<p>Because the I<sup>2</sup>C bus is open drain, the actual voltage appearing on the SDA and SCL lines is determined by the pullup resistor connection for both upstream and downstream signals. If you have a 3.3-V system, then SDA and SCL (upstream) will likely be pulled up to 3.3 V. To be safe, you’d probably run the TCA8845A at 3.3 V as well. However, you can switch to a downstream channel (say, SD3 and SC3) and connect it to a 5-V device with 5-V pullup resistors on that downstream bus. The SD3 and SC3 pins on the TCA9548A will handle the 5-V signal just fine, without passing this voltage on to the controller device running at 3.3 V.</p>&#13;
<p>Conversely, if your controller is running at 5 V and you power the TCA9548A at 5 V, you can connect one of the downstream channels to a 3.3-V system by simply using pullups to 3.3 V on that channel’s lines.</p>&#13;
<h3 id="h2-502468c12-0005">12.1.5	Reducing Bus Loading and Bus Speed</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">In addition to acting as a level shifter, the TCA9548A can reduce (capacitive) loading on the I<sup>2</sup>C bus. Suppose you have a dozen devices on an I<sup>2</sup>C bus and the loading is forcing you to run at 100 kHz instead of 400 kHz. You can use a TCA9548A to spread out those 12 devices across 8 or 9 buses, including the original upstream bus, to reduce capacitive loading. Even if there are no address conflicts, the TCA9548A is useful in this capacity.</p>&#13;
<p>The TCA9548A, by the way, can operate at normal (100 kHz) or fast (400 kHz) speed. It does not operate at fast mode plus (1 MHz) or faster.</p>&#13;
<h3 id="h2-502468c12-0006"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_257" title="257"/>12.1.6	Switching Between Buses</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">As I mentioned earlier, you activate a downstream bus by writing a 1 to the corresponding bit position in the TCA9548A register (and 0s to all the other bit positions). If you have three devices on downstream buses (SD0, SC0), (SD1, SC1), and (SD2, SC2) and you want to send data to each of these devices, use this process:</p>&#13;
<ol class="decimal">&#13;
<li value="1">Write 0x01 (0b0000_0001) to the TCA9548A at address 0x70.</li>&#13;
<li value="2">Write the data to the device on (SD0, SC0) by simply writing to SDA and SCL as though it were an upstream device.</li>&#13;
<li value="3">Write 0x02 (0b0000_0010) to the TCA9548A to activate (SD1, SC1).</li>&#13;
<li value="4">Write to the second device on (SD1, SC1), just treating it as if it were an upstream device.</li>&#13;
<li value="5">Write 0x04 (0b0000_0100) to the TCA9548A to activate (SD2, SC2).</li>&#13;
<li value="6">Write to the third device on (SD2, SC2), just treating it as if it were an upstream device.</li>&#13;
<li value="7">(optional) Write 0x0 to the TCA9548A to disable all downstream buses.&#13;
<p class="ListBody">As noted earlier, no upstream devices at any I<sup>2</sup>C address should appear on a downstream bus. That would create a conflict between the device on the upstream and downstream buses.</p>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<h3 id="h2-502468c12-0007">12.1.7	Cascading TCA9548A Multiplexers</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Because the TCA9548A has three address lines, you can place up to eight of them on the same I<sup>2</sup>C bus. This gives you access to 64 (roughly) independent I<sup>2</sup>C buses driving from the same pair of SDA and SCL lines on the controller; that’s 112 × 64 = 7,168 independent addresses. If this isn’t sufficient, you can cascade the multiplexers. Each downstream level needs a unique address, within a given level (that is, all TCA9548A devices connected to the outputs of the same TCA9548A can have the same address). In <a href="#figure12-2" id="figureanchor12-2">Figure 12-2</a>, for example, the top TCA9548A could have address 0x70, the light gray ones could have address 0x71, and the dark gray ones could all have address 0x72.</p>&#13;
<p>To write to a device connected to the rightmost TCA9548A in <a href="#figure12-2">Figure 12-2</a> (assuming channels from left to right are numbered 0 to 7), you’d start by writing 0x80 (0b1000_0000) to the TCA9548A at address 0x70 (the one connected directly to the controller). You would then write 0x80 to address 0x71 (corresponding to the rightmost light gray TCA9548A) and finally select the bus you wanted on the rightmost dark gray TCA9548A by writing the bus setting to address 0x72. </p>&#13;
<p>In practice, cascading TCA9548A devices in this manner is likely to create all types of timing and loading problems, so I wouldn’t recommend it. The only good reason to cascade multiplexers would be because you need more than eight buses and there’s only one open address in the range 0x70 through 0x77 on your upstream bus.</p>&#13;

</figure>&#13;
<p>Because the TCA9548A is a surface mount device (SMD), it’s a bit difficult to wire into a typical breadboard or prototype circuit. Fortunately, Adafruit, SparkFun, and other manufacturers provide breakout boards that make these devices easy to use. The following sections describe these breakout boards.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-502468c12-0002">	12.2	The Adafruit TCA9548A I<sup>2</sup>C Expander</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">The Adafruit TCA9548A I<sup>2</sup>C Expander is a traditional breakout board, containing a single TCA9548A with the pins brought out on 0.1-inch centers (see the smaller breakout board in <a href="#figure12-3" id="figureanchor12-3">Figure 12-3</a>). It also provides a bypass capacitor; pullup resistors for SDA, SCL, and reset; and three pulldown resistors that pull A0, A1, and A2 to Gnd so the device defaults to address 0x70. There are solder jumpers on the back of the PCB so you can cut the pullup resistors to SDA and SCL (in case you’ve already got pullups on the upstream bus) and also set the address. </p>&#13;

<div class="top hr"><hr/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<section class="note">&#13;
<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>&#13;
<p>	Because the address pins also come out on the connections on the edge of the board, you can set the address by wiring the A0, A1, and A2 PCB connectors to Vcc or Gnd.</p>&#13;
<div class="bottom hr"><hr/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</section>&#13;
</aside>&#13;
<p>The Adafruit breakout board does not put pullup resistors on the downstream buses. Many breakout boards such as those from Adafruit and SparkFun include pullup resistors, so they wouldn’t be necessary on the TCA9548A I<sup>2</sup>C Expander. Even more importantly, if you want to use this board as a level shifter, you want to be able to control what voltage the pullup resistors connect to. However, don’t forget that if you connect some I<sup>2</sup>C IC directly to a downstream bus, you have to add the pullup resistors yourself.</p>&#13;

<h2 id="h1-502468c12-0003">	12.3	The SparkFun I<sup>2</sup>C Mux</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">SparkFun’s I<sup>2</sup>C Mux device (see <a href="#figure12-3">Figure 12-3</a>) is handy if you work with Qwiic devices: it accepts an upstream Qwiic connector, routes it through the board if you want to connect other upstream devices, and then provides the eight downstream buses on Qwiic connectors. </p>&#13;
<p>There are some major differences between the SparkFun implementation and the Adafruit TCA9548A I<sup>2</sup>C Expander. First, because it’s Qwiic based, the SparkFun expander is largely a 3.3-V device only (though see the next note). The SparkFun board provides pullup resistors for downstream and upstream buses at 3.3 V; you can remove the upstream pullups by cutting some traces, but you don’t have this option with the pullups on the downstream buses.</p>&#13;
<aside epub:type="sidebar">&#13;
<div class="top hr"><hr/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<section class="note">&#13;
<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>&#13;
<p>	In theory, you could plug in a Qwiic connector with bare wires on the other end and stick pullup resistors with the appropriate voltage on them. However, when dealing with the Qwiic system, it’s best to keep everything 3.3 V.</p>&#13;
<div class="bottom hr"><hr/>&#13;
</div>&#13;
</section>&#13;
</aside>&#13;
<p>The second major difference between the SparkFun and Adafruit boards is size. Because the SparkFun board includes 10 Qwiic connectors (2 for the upstream bus, 8 for the downstream buses), the board is quite a bit larger than the Adafruit device (see <a href="#figure12-3">Figure 12-3</a>).</p>&#13;
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_260" title="260"/>Beyond these issues, the functionality of the SparkFun and Adafruit boards is exactly the same. Personally, if I were using Qwiic system parts, I’d use the SparkFun board; otherwise, I’d probably use the Adafruit board.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-502468c12-0004">	12.4	Chapter Summary</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">This chapter discussed three different I<sup>2</sup>C multiplexers: the TCA9543A, TCA9545A, and TCA9548A. These ICs allow you to expand a single I<sup>2</sup>C bus to two, four, or eight independent buses. This chapter discussed making device connections (upstream and downstream) to the multiplexers, programming the multiplexer, and connecting the multiplexer to an I<sup>2</sup>C bus. It also described how to use the TCA9548A as a level shifter and commented on the operating frequency of the device. This chapter concluded the generic discussion of the TCA9548A by describing how to cascade devices to support more than eight additional I<sup>2</sup>C buses.</p>&#13;
<p>Finally, this chapter described two breakout boards manufactured by Adafruit and SparkFun. The Adafruit I<sup>2</sup>C Expander board is a traditional breakout board, bringing out the pins on a TCA9548A IC to 0.1-inch–centered pins on a small PCB. The SparkFun I<sup>2</sup>C Mux provides eight Qwiic connectors (rather than pins) for expanding the bus.</p>&#13;

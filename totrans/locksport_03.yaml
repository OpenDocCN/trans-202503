- en: Before we dive into picking, it’s worth taking some time to examine the locks
    themselves. Locks come in a huge variety of designs based on factors including
    what the lock will be used on, how it’s attached, how secure it needs to be, and
    even the country where it will be used. These criteria matter greatly to someone
    installing a lock but are largely irrelevant to locksporters. Since we’re concerned
    only with opening a lock, locksporters usually set aside any accessories, such
    as the hardware to mount it to a door. In fact, locksporters typically save only
    the lock’s cylinder, the part normally operated with a key. The exception is locks
    with a cylinder that can’t be removed from the rest of the lock hardware, such
    as some padlocks.

    as the lock mechanics, it can still play a part in the way a lock is picked. Being
    familiar with the various types of locks and cylinders, as well as the lockpicking
    tools you might need for them, is also helpful when you’re buying, trading, researching,
    or discussing locks.

    types, padlocks are the most diverse. They include everything from suitcase zipper
    locks the size of a thumbnail to behemoths like the Sargent & Greenleaf (S&G)
    951, which weighs several pounds and can withstand a barrage of bullets—an important
    trait for a lock used to secure military depots. [Figure 2-1](ch2.xhtml#ch2fig1)
    shows an assortment of padlocks.

    hardware stores, big-box stores, and even supermarkets and convenience stores.
    Most are reasonably sized, making them easy to hold while picking. Because they
    vary significantly in both their locking mechanisms and security features, you
    can find padlocks to challenge lockpickers of any skill level. And, best of all,
    padlocks often make a very satisfying *clang* when you get them open.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a few things to know about picking padlocks. In most cases, you can
    open them only by turning their *plug* (the part that rotates) clockwise, whether
    you’re picking or using the key. Also, once you’ve picked a padlock, the force
    required to turn and open it varies considerably depending on the lock’s brand
    and model. Whenever possible, test a padlock with a key first to get a feel for
    the amount of force you’ll need. Finally, since padlocks vary so much in size
    and weight, it’s a good idea to have a vise on hand to hold the lock while you’re
    picking it.

    *cylinder lock*. Lock cylinders come in a variety of shapes and sizes to accommodate
    multiple styles of doors and door hardware (such as doorknobs) that are used in
    different countries. In this section, we’ll look at some of the most common types
    of door cylinders: Euro profile, key-in-knob, interchangeable core, rim, and mortise

    *Euro profile*, *Euro cylinders*, or even just *profile cylinders*—are, as their
    name indicates, found throughout much of Europe, most often in doors. Euro profile
    cylinders vary considerably in both length and locking mechanism but can be recognized
    by their signature shape, which looks somewhat like an upside-down exclamation
    point, as shown in [Figure 2-2](ch2.xhtml#ch2fig2).

- en: Many Euro profile cylinders are double-sided, meaning they have a *keyway* (the
    hole to insert the key) on both sides of the lock. However, some have a *thumb
    turn* (a small knob to lock or unlock the lock without a key) on the interior
    side and a keyway only on the exterior side. In picking competitions that include
    Euro profile cylinders, double-sided locks are the norm, and typically the contestant
    can pick either side. When not mounted in a door, many cylinder types, including
    Euro profile cylinders, can be picked clockwise or counterclockwise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Double-sided locks are less common in the US, where fire safety often takes
    precedence over door security. Single-sided locks with a thumb turn can be quickly
    opened from the inside, but they make it easier for thieves to break a nearby
    window and reach in to unlock the door.

- en: The Euro profile cylinder’s shape fits well in most people’s palms, so many
    locksporters prefer to hold it rather than use a vise when picking. For extended
    picking sessions, such as long competitions, however, using a vise can help prevent
    hand cramps.

    looks similar to a Euro profile cylinder, except that the bottom area where the
    lock screws into the door is centered in the cylinder rather than extending its
    full width, as shown in [Figure 2-3](ch2.xhtml#ch2fig3).

    are extremely popular. These small locks fit inside a doorknob or lever handle,
    hence their name. Like Euro profile cylinders, unmounted KIKs can be picked clockwise
    or counterclockwise.
  prefs: []

    in half and slightly shrunk. Their shape is a bit less recognizable, though, because
    everything except the plug is hidden inside the knob. For example, only the silver
    portion of the KIK cylinder shown in [Figure 2-5](ch2.xhtml#ch2fig5) would be
    visible when the lock is installed.

- en: An *interchangeable core (IC) cylinder* looks like a figure eight or a snowman
    with a metal bar protruding from the side, known as a *control lug*. ICs are common
    in office and commercial buildings because they can easily be removed and replaced
    using nothing more than a *control key*, a special key that retracts the control
    lug into the core. When someone loses a key or leaves the company, rekeying the
    office takes 5 seconds instead of 30 minutes because a new core can simply be
    swapped in using the control key. The old cores are typically rekeyed and set
    aside for the next time they’re needed.

    size and shape originally designed and created by the BEST Lock Corporation (now
    part of Dormakaba), LFICs come in many shapes and sizes. SFICs are made up of
    two symmetrical circles and are smaller than LFICs and RCs. LFICs and RCs are
    less standardized and vary depending on the brand, but they often have a core
    comprising two circles of slightly different sizes. [Figure 2-6](ch2.xhtml#ch2fig6)

    lock to the surface of the door. Mortise cylinders, on the other hand, have a
    threaded housing that allows the entire cylinder to be threaded into the lock
    hardware, which is then inserted into a cutout in the door, known as a *mortise*.
    Once the mortise cylinder is threaded into the lock, one or more set screws are
    used to hold the cylinder in place so it can’t be backed out.

    features are incorporated into the mortise lock body itself. It’s most commonly
    found in England and in antique doors elsewhere. As [Figure 2-8](ch2.xhtml#ch2fig8)

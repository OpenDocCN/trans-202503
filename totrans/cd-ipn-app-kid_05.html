<h2 class="h2a">WRITING CODE THAT LOOPS</h2>
<div class="image1"><img src="Image00001.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">You just learned that you use conditional statements to run different branches of code depending on which conditions are met. <em>Loops</em>
 are another way you can control the order of your programs. With a loop, you can tell the computer to execute a block of code as many times as you want. This lets you reuse chunks of code again and again so that you don’t have to rewrite them!</p>
<p class="indent">In Swift, there are two main types of loops: <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops and <span class="code">while</span>
 loops. The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop tells the computer to run a loop a certain number of times, and it’s useful when you know right off the bat how many times you want the code to repeat. The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop tells the computer to keep running a loop over and over until a certain condition is met, which is great when you’re more interested in repeating code based on events or conditions in your program. Let’s dig into each type of loop and learn more about it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec1"><span id="page_48"></span>
 <strong>OPEN THE DEBUG AREA</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Before we get started writing loops, let’s make sure your playground is set up to display the debug area. When you write <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops in the playground, the results sidebar on the right tells you only how many times a loop runs. To see the loop’s output, you need to display the debug area of the playground by selecting <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 (<span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y). If this menu says Hide Debug Area, then it’s already showing the debug area, and you don’t need to do anything.</p>
<p class="indent">When you show the debug area, it appears at the bottom of your playground by default, and you can drag the divider line at the top of it to make it taller or shorter.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec2">
<strong>LOOPING THROUGH RANGES AND COLLECTIONS WITH FOR-IN</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop tells the computer to run the loop over a range of numbers or for each item in a collection. We’ll talk more about collections in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but for now, think of a collection as a group of items—like a bag of marbles or a case of trophies. Let’s see how we loop through a range of numbers first.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00091.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec1">
<strong>SAY HELLO!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to tell the computer something like, “I want to run this bit of code 4 times.” To do this, you write the <span class="code">for</span>
 keyword, followed by a variable to count how many times the loop runs, then the <span class="code">in</span>
 keyword, and finally the range of numbers that you want the loop to run through. Let’s write a simple <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop that prints your name 4 times:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">for</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 number <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue1">1...4</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hello, my name is Colin."</span>
 ) <span class="green">// Use your own name here!</span>
<br />
}</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop begins with the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a variable <span class="ent">➊</span>
 that will be used as a counter to go through the range of numbers. We named our counter variable <span class="code">number</span>
 , but you can give this variable any name you want. After the counter variable comes the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 . This keyword tells the computer to expect a range of integers. After <span class="code">in</span>
 , we provide the range that we want the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to use, <span class="code">1...4</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This is called a <em>closed range</em>
 from <span class="code">1</span>
 to <span class="code">4</span>
 , and it indicates that the count starts at <span class="code">1</span>
 and ends at <span class="code">4</span>
 . The three-dot symbol (<span class="code">...</span>
 ) is the <em>closed range operator</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_49"></span>
 Let’s add a line to our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop so that we can see how <span class="code">number</span>
 increases from 1 through 4. Add the following line right after the line that prints your name inside the loop:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"And the value of number is now</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 number<span class="red">).</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="red">\n"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we use <span class="code">number</span>
 just as we would any other variable. This statement prints a string that contains the value of <span class="code">number</span>
 . To embed variables and constants into strings, you type a backslash and then enter the variable or constant you want to print in parentheses, just like we did at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . This prints the variable’s value with the rest of your string. Pretty cool!</p>
<p class="indent">To make the output prettier, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we also added an empty new line at the end of the sentence by writing the special character for a new line, <span class="code">\n</span>
 . When that sentence is printed, the computer does not print <span class="code">\n</span>
 but instead adds a new line, like when you press <span class="smallcaps">RETURN</span>
 or <span class="smallcaps">ENTER</span>
 on your keyboard.</p>
<p class="indent">Your screen should look like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig1">Figure 4-1</a>
 . If you don’t see the printed text, make sure the debug area is turned on by pressing <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y.</p>

<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-1: Debug area display of a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run 4 times. The first time the loop runs, <span class="code">number</span>
 is equal to 1; the second time it runs, it’s equal to 2; and so on until the final loop, when it’s equal to 4. When <span class="code">number</span>
 reaches the end of the range 1 through 4, the loop ends.</p>
<p class="indent">In a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, when the counter, <span class="code">number</span>
 , cycles through the loop, increasing from 1 to 4, we say that the counter <em>iterates</em>
 over the range from 1 to 4. Each time the code inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is run, we call that an <em>iteration</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can change these numbers to set different ranges to loop through. Try it out and see what happens!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec2"><span id="page_50"></span>
 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">let</span>
 kidsInClass = [<span class="red">"Gretchen"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Kristina"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Jimmy"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Marcus"</span>
 , <img class="inline" src="Image00093.jpg" />
<br />
      <span class="red">"Helen"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Eric"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Alex"</span>
 ]<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>
 kidsName <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="green1">kidsInClass</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Good Morning</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 kidsName<span class="red">)!"</span>
 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 numberIAmThinkingOf = <span class="blue1">7</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Thinking of a number between 1 and 20. Guess what it is."</span>
 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 != <span class="green1">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 {<br />
<br />
      <span class="green">// Guessing a random number</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 = <span class="violet">Int</span>
 (<span class="blue">arc4random_uniform</span>
 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)?"</span>
 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>

<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

<h2 class="h2a">WRITING CODE THAT LOOPS</h2>
<div class="image1"><img src="Image00001.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">You just learned that you use conditional statements to run different branches of code depending on which conditions are met. <em>Loops</em>
 are another way you can control the order of your programs. With a loop, you can tell the computer to execute a block of code as many times as you want. This lets you reuse chunks of code again and again so that you don’t have to rewrite them!</p>
<p class="indent">In Swift, there are two main types of loops: <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops and <span class="code">while</span>
 loops. The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop tells the computer to run a loop a certain number of times, and it’s useful when you know right off the bat how many times you want the code to repeat. The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop tells the computer to keep running a loop over and over until a certain condition is met, which is great when you’re more interested in repeating code based on events or conditions in your program. Let’s dig into each type of loop and learn more about it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec1"><span id="page_48"></span>
 <strong>OPEN THE DEBUG AREA</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Before we get started writing loops, let’s make sure your playground is set up to display the debug area. When you write <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops in the playground, the results sidebar on the right tells you only how many times a loop runs. To see the loop’s output, you need to display the debug area of the playground by selecting <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 (<span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y). If this menu says Hide Debug Area, then it’s already showing the debug area, and you don’t need to do anything.</p>
<p class="indent">When you show the debug area, it appears at the bottom of your playground by default, and you can drag the divider line at the top of it to make it taller or shorter.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec2">
<strong>LOOPING THROUGH RANGES AND COLLECTIONS WITH FOR-IN</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop tells the computer to run the loop over a range of numbers or for each item in a collection. We’ll talk more about collections in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but for now, think of a collection as a group of items—like a bag of marbles or a case of trophies. Let’s see how we loop through a range of numbers first.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00091.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec1">
<strong>SAY HELLO!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to tell the computer something like, “I want to run this bit of code 4 times.” To do this, you write the <span class="code">for</span>
 keyword, followed by a variable to count how many times the loop runs, then the <span class="code">in</span>
 keyword, and finally the range of numbers that you want the loop to run through. Let’s write a simple <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop that prints your name 4 times:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">for</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 number <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue1">1...4</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hello, my name is Colin."</span>
 ) <span class="green">// Use your own name here!</span>
<br />
}</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop begins with the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a variable <span class="ent">➊</span>
 that will be used as a counter to go through the range of numbers. We named our counter variable <span class="code">number</span>
 , but you can give this variable any name you want. After the counter variable comes the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 . This keyword tells the computer to expect a range of integers. After <span class="code">in</span>
 , we provide the range that we want the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to use, <span class="code">1...4</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This is called a <em>closed range</em>
 from <span class="code">1</span>
 to <span class="code">4</span>
 , and it indicates that the count starts at <span class="code">1</span>
 and ends at <span class="code">4</span>
 . The three-dot symbol (<span class="code">...</span>
 ) is the <em>closed range operator</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_49"></span>
 Let’s add a line to our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop so that we can see how <span class="code">number</span>
 increases from 1 through 4. Add the following line right after the line that prints your name inside the loop:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"And the value of number is now</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 number<span class="red">).</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="red">\n"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we use <span class="code">number</span>
 just as we would any other variable. This statement prints a string that contains the value of <span class="code">number</span>
 . To embed variables and constants into strings, you type a backslash and then enter the variable or constant you want to print in parentheses, just like we did at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . This prints the variable’s value with the rest of your string. Pretty cool!</p>
<p class="indent">To make the output prettier, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we also added an empty new line at the end of the sentence by writing the special character for a new line, <span class="code">\n</span>
 . When that sentence is printed, the computer does not print <span class="code">\n</span>
 but instead adds a new line, like when you press <span class="smallcaps">RETURN</span>
 or <span class="smallcaps">ENTER</span>
 on your keyboard.</p>
<p class="indent">Your screen should look like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig1">Figure 4-1</a>
 . If you don’t see the printed text, make sure the debug area is turned on by pressing <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-1: Debug area display of a <span class="code">for-in</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run 4 times. The first time the loop runs, <span class="code">number</span>
 is equal to 1; the second time it runs, it’s equal to 2; and so on until the final loop, when it’s equal to 4. When <span class="code">number</span>
 reaches the end of the range 1 through 4, the loop ends.</p>
<p class="indent">In a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, when the counter, <span class="code">number</span>
 , cycles through the loop, increasing from 1 to 4, we say that the counter <em>iterates</em>
 over the range from 1 to 4. Each time the code inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is run, we call that an <em>iteration</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can change these numbers to set different ranges to loop through. Try it out and see what happens!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec2"><span id="page_50"></span>
 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">

      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Good Morning</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 kidsName<span class="red">)!"</span>
 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>

 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>

<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>

  }<br />
<br />

<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="green1">shrinking</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>
 count <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...<span class="blue1">10</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green">// NEST A</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="pink">if</span>
 count % <span class="blue1">2</span>
 == <span class="blue1">0</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST B</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 starString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 starCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 dashString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (dashString)<br />
     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image1"><img src="Image00001.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">You just learned that you use conditional statements to run different branches of code depending on which conditions are met. <em>Loops</em>
 are another way you can control the order of your programs. With a loop, you can tell the computer to execute a block of code as many times as you want. This lets you reuse chunks of code again and again so that you don’t have to rewrite them!</p>
<p class="indent">In Swift, there are two main types of loops: <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops and <span class="code">while</span>
 loops. The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop tells the computer to run a loop a certain number of times, and it’s useful when you know right off the bat how many times you want the code to repeat. The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop tells the computer to keep running a loop over and over until a certain condition is met, which is great when you’re more interested in repeating code based on events or conditions in your program. Let’s dig into each type of loop and learn more about it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec1"><span id="page_48"></span>
 <strong>OPEN THE DEBUG AREA</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Before we get started writing loops, let’s make sure your playground is set up to display the debug area. When you write <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops in the playground, the results sidebar on the right tells you only how many times a loop runs. To see the loop’s output, you need to display the debug area of the playground by selecting <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 (<span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y). If this menu says Hide Debug Area, then it’s already showing the debug area, and you don’t need to do anything.</p>
<p class="indent">When you show the debug area, it appears at the bottom of your playground by default, and you can drag the divider line at the top of it to make it taller or shorter.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec2">
<strong>LOOPING THROUGH RANGES AND COLLECTIONS WITH FOR-IN</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop tells the computer to run the loop over a range of numbers or for each item in a collection. We’ll talk more about collections in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but for now, think of a collection as a group of items—like a bag of marbles or a case of trophies. Let’s see how we loop through a range of numbers first.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00091.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec1">
<strong>SAY HELLO!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to tell the computer something like, “I want to run this bit of code 4 times.” To do this, you write the <span class="code">for</span>
 keyword, followed by a variable to count how many times the loop runs, then the <span class="code">in</span>
 keyword, and finally the range of numbers that you want the loop to run through. Let’s write a simple <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop that prints your name 4 times:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">for</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 number <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue1">1...4</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hello, my name is Colin."</span>
 ) <span class="green">// Use your own name here!</span>
<br />
}</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop begins with the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a variable <span class="ent">➊</span>
 that will be used as a counter to go through the range of numbers. We named our counter variable <span class="code">number</span>
 , but you can give this variable any name you want. After the counter variable comes the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 . This keyword tells the computer to expect a range of integers. After <span class="code">in</span>
 , we provide the range that we want the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to use, <span class="code">1...4</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This is called a <em>closed range</em>
 from <span class="code">1</span>
 to <span class="code">4</span>
 , and it indicates that the count starts at <span class="code">1</span>
 and ends at <span class="code">4</span>
 . The three-dot symbol (<span class="code">...</span>
 ) is the <em>closed range operator</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_49"></span>
 Let’s add a line to our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop so that we can see how <span class="code">number</span>
 increases from 1 through 4. Add the following line right after the line that prints your name inside the loop:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"And the value of number is now</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 number<span class="red">).</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="red">\n"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we use <span class="code">number</span>
 just as we would any other variable. This statement prints a string that contains the value of <span class="code">number</span>
 . To embed variables and constants into strings, you type a backslash and then enter the variable or constant you want to print in parentheses, just like we did at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . This prints the variable’s value with the rest of your string. Pretty cool!</p>
<p class="indent">To make the output prettier, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we also added an empty new line at the end of the sentence by writing the special character for a new line, <span class="code">\n</span>
 . When that sentence is printed, the computer does not print <span class="code">\n</span>
 but instead adds a new line, like when you press <span class="smallcaps">RETURN</span>
 or <span class="smallcaps">ENTER</span>
 on your keyboard.</p>
<p class="indent">Your screen should look like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig1">Figure 4-1</a>

 is equal to 1; the second time it runs, it’s equal to 2; and so on until the final loop, when it’s equal to 4. When <span class="code">number</span>
 reaches the end of the range 1 through 4, the loop ends.</p>
<p class="indent">In a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, when the counter, <span class="code">number</span>
 , cycles through the loop, increasing from 1 to 4, we say that the counter <em>iterates</em>
 over the range from 1 to 4. Each time the code inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is run, we call that an <em>iteration</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can change these numbers to set different ranges to loop through. Try it out and see what happens!</p>

 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">let</span>
 kidsInClass = [<span class="red">"Gretchen"</span>

 <span class="green1">kidsInClass</span>

      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Good Morning</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 kidsName<span class="red">)!"</span>
 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>

<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>

 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>

      <span class="green">// Guessing a random number</span>

<span class="ent">➎</span>
     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>

 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>

 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>

         <span class="pink">for</span>

 <span class="blue1">1</span>

             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>

             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>

         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>

             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (dashString)<br />
     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">

</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>

 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>

 is.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">You just learned that you use conditional statements to run different branches of code depending on which conditions are met. <em>Loops</em>
 are another way you can control the order of your programs. With a loop, you can tell the computer to execute a block of code as many times as you want. This lets you reuse chunks of code again and again so that you don’t have to rewrite them!</p>
<p class="indent">In Swift, there are two main types of loops: <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops and <span class="code">while</span>
 loops. The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop tells the computer to run a loop a certain number of times, and it’s useful when you know right off the bat how many times you want the code to repeat. The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop tells the computer to keep running a loop over and over until a certain condition is met, which is great when you’re more interested in repeating code based on events or conditions in your program. Let’s dig into each type of loop and learn more about it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec1"><span id="page_48"></span>
 <strong>OPEN THE DEBUG AREA</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Before we get started writing loops, let’s make sure your playground is set up to display the debug area. When you write <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops in the playground, the results sidebar on the right tells you only how many times a loop runs. To see the loop’s output, you need to display the debug area of the playground by selecting <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 (<span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y). If this menu says Hide Debug Area, then it’s already showing the debug area, and you don’t need to do anything.</p>
<p class="indent">When you show the debug area, it appears at the bottom of your playground by default, and you can drag the divider line at the top of it to make it taller or shorter.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec2">
<strong>LOOPING THROUGH RANGES AND COLLECTIONS WITH FOR-IN</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop tells the computer to run the loop over a range of numbers or for each item in a collection. We’ll talk more about collections in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but for now, think of a collection as a group of items—like a bag of marbles or a case of trophies. Let’s see how we loop through a range of numbers first.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00091.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec1">
<strong>SAY HELLO!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to tell the computer something like, “I want to run this bit of code 4 times.” To do this, you write the <span class="code">for</span>
 keyword, followed by a variable to count how many times the loop runs, then the <span class="code">in</span>
 keyword, and finally the range of numbers that you want the loop to run through. Let’s write a simple <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop that prints your name 4 times:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">for</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 number <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue1">1...4</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hello, my name is Colin."</span>
 ) <span class="green">// Use your own name here!</span>
<br />
}</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop begins with the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a variable <span class="ent">➊</span>
 that will be used as a counter to go through the range of numbers. We named our counter variable <span class="code">number</span>
 , but you can give this variable any name you want. After the counter variable comes the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 . This keyword tells the computer to expect a range of integers. After <span class="code">in</span>
 , we provide the range that we want the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to use, <span class="code">1...4</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This is called a <em>closed range</em>
 from <span class="code">1</span>
 to <span class="code">4</span>
 , and it indicates that the count starts at <span class="code">1</span>
 and ends at <span class="code">4</span>
 . The three-dot symbol (<span class="code">...</span>
 ) is the <em>closed range operator</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_49"></span>
 Let’s add a line to our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop so that we can see how <span class="code">number</span>
 increases from 1 through 4. Add the following line right after the line that prints your name inside the loop:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"And the value of number is now</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 number<span class="red">).</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="red">\n"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we use <span class="code">number</span>
 just as we would any other variable. This statement prints a string that contains the value of <span class="code">number</span>
 . To embed variables and constants into strings, you type a backslash and then enter the variable or constant you want to print in parentheses, just like we did at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . This prints the variable’s value with the rest of your string. Pretty cool!</p>
<p class="indent">To make the output prettier, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we also added an empty new line at the end of the sentence by writing the special character for a new line, <span class="code">\n</span>
 . When that sentence is printed, the computer does not print <span class="code">\n</span>
 but instead adds a new line, like when you press <span class="smallcaps">RETURN</span>
 or <span class="smallcaps">ENTER</span>
 on your keyboard.</p>
<p class="indent">Your screen should look like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig1">Figure 4-1</a>
 . If you don’t see the printed text, make sure the debug area is turned on by pressing <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-1: Debug area display of a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run 4 times. The first time the loop runs, <span class="code">number</span>
 is equal to 1; the second time it runs, it’s equal to 2; and so on until the final loop, when it’s equal to 4. When <span class="code">number</span>
 reaches the end of the range 1 through 4, the loop ends.</p>
<p class="indent">In a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, when the counter, <span class="code">number</span>
 , cycles through the loop, increasing from 1 to 4, we say that the counter <em>iterates</em>
 over the range from 1 to 4. Each time the code inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is run, we call that an <em>iteration</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can change these numbers to set different ranges to loop through. Try it out and see what happens!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec2"><span id="page_50"></span>
 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">let</span>
 kidsInClass = [<span class="red">"Gretchen"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Kristina"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Jimmy"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Marcus"</span>
 , <img class="inline" src="Image00093.jpg" />
<br />
      <span class="red">"Helen"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Eric"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Alex"</span>
 ]<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>
 kidsName <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="green1">kidsInClass</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Good Morning</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 kidsName<span class="red">)!"</span>
 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 numberIAmThinkingOf = <span class="blue1">7</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Thinking of a number between 1 and 20. Guess what it is."</span>
 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 != <span class="green1">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 {<br />
<br />
      <span class="green">// Guessing a random number</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 = <span class="violet">Int</span>
 (<span class="blue">arc4random_uniform</span>
 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)?"</span>
 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>

<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="green1">shrinking</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">

         <span class="pink">var</span>

         <span class="pink">for</span>
 starCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 dashString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>

     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">In Swift, there are two main types of loops: <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops and <span class="code">while</span>
 loops. The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop tells the computer to run a loop a certain number of times, and it’s useful when you know right off the bat how many times you want the code to repeat. The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop tells the computer to keep running a loop over and over until a certain condition is met, which is great when you’re more interested in repeating code based on events or conditions in your program. Let’s dig into each type of loop and learn more about it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec1"><span id="page_48"></span>
 <strong>OPEN THE DEBUG AREA</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Before we get started writing loops, let’s make sure your playground is set up to display the debug area. When you write <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops in the playground, the results sidebar on the right tells you only how many times a loop runs. To see the loop’s output, you need to display the debug area of the playground by selecting <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 (<span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y). If this menu says Hide Debug Area, then it’s already showing the debug area, and you don’t need to do anything.</p>
<p class="indent">When you show the debug area, it appears at the bottom of your playground by default, and you can drag the divider line at the top of it to make it taller or shorter.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec2">
<strong>LOOPING THROUGH RANGES AND COLLECTIONS WITH FOR-IN</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop tells the computer to run the loop over a range of numbers or for each item in a collection. We’ll talk more about collections in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but for now, think of a collection as a group of items—like a bag of marbles or a case of trophies. Let’s see how we loop through a range of numbers first.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00091.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec1">
<strong>SAY HELLO!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to tell the computer something like, “I want to run this bit of code 4 times.” To do this, you write the <span class="code">for</span>
 keyword, followed by a variable to count how many times the loop runs, then the <span class="code">in</span>
 keyword, and finally the range of numbers that you want the loop to run through. Let’s write a simple <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop that prints your name 4 times:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">for</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 number <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue1">1...4</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hello, my name is Colin."</span>
 ) <span class="green">// Use your own name here!</span>
<br />
}</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop begins with the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a variable <span class="ent">➊</span>
 that will be used as a counter to go through the range of numbers. We named our counter variable <span class="code">number</span>
 , but you can give this variable any name you want. After the counter variable comes the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 . This keyword tells the computer to expect a range of integers. After <span class="code">in</span>
 , we provide the range that we want the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to use, <span class="code">1...4</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This is called a <em>closed range</em>
 from <span class="code">1</span>
 to <span class="code">4</span>
 , and it indicates that the count starts at <span class="code">1</span>
 and ends at <span class="code">4</span>
 . The three-dot symbol (<span class="code">...</span>
 ) is the <em>closed range operator</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_49"></span>
 Let’s add a line to our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop so that we can see how <span class="code">number</span>
 increases from 1 through 4. Add the following line right after the line that prints your name inside the loop:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"And the value of number is now</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 number<span class="red">).</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="red">\n"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we use <span class="code">number</span>
 just as we would any other variable. This statement prints a string that contains the value of <span class="code">number</span>
 . To embed variables and constants into strings, you type a backslash and then enter the variable or constant you want to print in parentheses, just like we did at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . This prints the variable’s value with the rest of your string. Pretty cool!</p>
<p class="indent">To make the output prettier, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we also added an empty new line at the end of the sentence by writing the special character for a new line, <span class="code">\n</span>
 . When that sentence is printed, the computer does not print <span class="code">\n</span>
 but instead adds a new line, like when you press <span class="smallcaps">RETURN</span>
 or <span class="smallcaps">ENTER</span>
 on your keyboard.</p>
<p class="indent">Your screen should look like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig1">Figure 4-1</a>
 . If you don’t see the printed text, make sure the debug area is turned on by pressing <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-1: Debug area display of a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run 4 times. The first time the loop runs, <span class="code">number</span>
 is equal to 1; the second time it runs, it’s equal to 2; and so on until the final loop, when it’s equal to 4. When <span class="code">number</span>
 reaches the end of the range 1 through 4, the loop ends.</p>
<p class="indent">In a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, when the counter, <span class="code">number</span>
 , cycles through the loop, increasing from 1 to 4, we say that the counter <em>iterates</em>
 over the range from 1 to 4. Each time the code inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is run, we call that an <em>iteration</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can change these numbers to set different ranges to loop through. Try it out and see what happens!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec2"><span id="page_50"></span>
 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">

      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Good Morning</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 kidsName<span class="red">)!"</span>
 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>

<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="green1">shrinking</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>
 count <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...<span class="blue1">10</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green">// NEST A</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="pink">if</span>
 count % <span class="blue1">2</span>
 == <span class="blue1">0</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST B</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 starString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 starCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 dashString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (dashString)<br />
     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>

 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

 <strong>OPEN THE DEBUG AREA</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Before we get started writing loops, let’s make sure your playground is set up to display the debug area. When you write <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops in the playground, the results sidebar on the right tells you only how many times a loop runs. To see the loop’s output, you need to display the debug area of the playground by selecting <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 (<span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y). If this menu says Hide Debug Area, then it’s already showing the debug area, and you don’t need to do anything.</p>
<p class="indent">When you show the debug area, it appears at the bottom of your playground by default, and you can drag the divider line at the top of it to make it taller or shorter.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec2">
<strong>LOOPING THROUGH RANGES AND COLLECTIONS WITH FOR-IN</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop tells the computer to run the loop over a range of numbers or for each item in a collection. We’ll talk more about collections in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but for now, think of a collection as a group of items—like a bag of marbles or a case of trophies. Let’s see how we loop through a range of numbers first.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00091.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec1">
<strong>SAY HELLO!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to tell the computer something like, “I want to run this bit of code 4 times.” To do this, you write the <span class="code">for</span>
 keyword, followed by a variable to count how many times the loop runs, then the <span class="code">in</span>
 keyword, and finally the range of numbers that you want the loop to run through. Let’s write a simple <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop that prints your name 4 times:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">for</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 number <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue1">1...4</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hello, my name is Colin."</span>
 ) <span class="green">// Use your own name here!</span>
<br />
}</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop begins with the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a variable <span class="ent">➊</span>
 that will be used as a counter to go through the range of numbers. We named our counter variable <span class="code">number</span>
 , but you can give this variable any name you want. After the counter variable comes the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 . This keyword tells the computer to expect a range of integers. After <span class="code">in</span>
 , we provide the range that we want the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to use, <span class="code">1...4</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This is called a <em>closed range</em>
 from <span class="code">1</span>
 to <span class="code">4</span>
 , and it indicates that the count starts at <span class="code">1</span>
 and ends at <span class="code">4</span>
 . The three-dot symbol (<span class="code">...</span>
 ) is the <em>closed range operator</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_49"></span>
 Let’s add a line to our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop so that we can see how <span class="code">number</span>
 increases from 1 through 4. Add the following line right after the line that prints your name inside the loop:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="blue">print</span>

</div>
<p class="indent">Inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we use <span class="code">number</span>
 just as we would any other variable. This statement prints a string that contains the value of <span class="code">number</span>
 . To embed variables and constants into strings, you type a backslash and then enter the variable or constant you want to print in parentheses, just like we did at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . This prints the variable’s value with the rest of your string. Pretty cool!</p>
<p class="indent">To make the output prettier, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we also added an empty new line at the end of the sentence by writing the special character for a new line, <span class="code">\n</span>
 . When that sentence is printed, the computer does not print <span class="code">\n</span>
 but instead adds a new line, like when you press <span class="smallcaps">RETURN</span>
 or <span class="smallcaps">ENTER</span>
 on your keyboard.</p>

 loop will run 4 times. The first time the loop runs, <span class="code">number</span>
 is equal to 1; the second time it runs, it’s equal to 2; and so on until the final loop, when it’s equal to 4. When <span class="code">number</span>

<p class="indent">In a <span class="code">for-in</span>

 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">let</span>

      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Good Morning</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 kidsName<span class="red">)!"</span>
 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>

<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>

 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>

      <span class="green">// Guessing a random number</span>

     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>

 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>

  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">

<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>

         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>

  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">Before we get started writing loops, let’s make sure your playground is set up to display the debug area. When you write <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops in the playground, the results sidebar on the right tells you only how many times a loop runs. To see the loop’s output, you need to display the debug area of the playground by selecting <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 (<span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y). If this menu says Hide Debug Area, then it’s already showing the debug area, and you don’t need to do anything.</p>
<p class="indent">When you show the debug area, it appears at the bottom of your playground by default, and you can drag the divider line at the top of it to make it taller or shorter.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec2">
<strong>LOOPING THROUGH RANGES AND COLLECTIONS WITH FOR-IN</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop tells the computer to run the loop over a range of numbers or for each item in a collection. We’ll talk more about collections in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but for now, think of a collection as a group of items—like a bag of marbles or a case of trophies. Let’s see how we loop through a range of numbers first.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00091.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec1">
<strong>SAY HELLO!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to tell the computer something like, “I want to run this bit of code 4 times.” To do this, you write the <span class="code">for</span>
 keyword, followed by a variable to count how many times the loop runs, then the <span class="code">in</span>
 keyword, and finally the range of numbers that you want the loop to run through. Let’s write a simple <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop that prints your name 4 times:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">for</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 number <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue1">1...4</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hello, my name is Colin."</span>
 ) <span class="green">// Use your own name here!</span>
<br />
}</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop begins with the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a variable <span class="ent">➊</span>
 that will be used as a counter to go through the range of numbers. We named our counter variable <span class="code">number</span>
 , but you can give this variable any name you want. After the counter variable comes the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 . This keyword tells the computer to expect a range of integers. After <span class="code">in</span>
 , we provide the range that we want the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to use, <span class="code">1...4</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This is called a <em>closed range</em>
 from <span class="code">1</span>
 to <span class="code">4</span>
 , and it indicates that the count starts at <span class="code">1</span>
 and ends at <span class="code">4</span>
 . The three-dot symbol (<span class="code">...</span>
 ) is the <em>closed range operator</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_49"></span>
 Let’s add a line to our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop so that we can see how <span class="code">number</span>
 increases from 1 through 4. Add the following line right after the line that prints your name inside the loop:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"And the value of number is now</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 number<span class="red">).</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="red">\n"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we use <span class="code">number</span>
 just as we would any other variable. This statement prints a string that contains the value of <span class="code">number</span>
 . To embed variables and constants into strings, you type a backslash and then enter the variable or constant you want to print in parentheses, just like we did at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . This prints the variable’s value with the rest of your string. Pretty cool!</p>
<p class="indent">To make the output prettier, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we also added an empty new line at the end of the sentence by writing the special character for a new line, <span class="code">\n</span>
 . When that sentence is printed, the computer does not print <span class="code">\n</span>
 but instead adds a new line, like when you press <span class="smallcaps">RETURN</span>
 or <span class="smallcaps">ENTER</span>
 on your keyboard.</p>
<p class="indent">Your screen should look like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig1">Figure 4-1</a>
 . If you don’t see the printed text, make sure the debug area is turned on by pressing <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-1: Debug area display of a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run 4 times. The first time the loop runs, <span class="code">number</span>
 is equal to 1; the second time it runs, it’s equal to 2; and so on until the final loop, when it’s equal to 4. When <span class="code">number</span>
 reaches the end of the range 1 through 4, the loop ends.</p>
<p class="indent">In a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, when the counter, <span class="code">number</span>
 , cycles through the loop, increasing from 1 to 4, we say that the counter <em>iterates</em>
 over the range from 1 to 4. Each time the code inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is run, we call that an <em>iteration</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can change these numbers to set different ranges to loop through. Try it out and see what happens!</p>

 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">let</span>
 kidsInClass = [<span class="red">"Gretchen"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Kristina"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Jimmy"</span>

 , <img class="inline" src="Image00093.jpg" />
<br />
      <span class="red">"Helen"</span>

<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>
 kidsName <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="green1">kidsInClass</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Good Morning</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 kidsName<span class="red">)!"</span>
 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 numberIAmThinkingOf = <span class="blue1">7</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Thinking of a number between 1 and 20. Guess what it is."</span>
 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 != <span class="green1">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>

<br />
      <span class="green">// Guessing a random number</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 = <span class="violet">Int</span>
 (<span class="blue">arc4random_uniform</span>
 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)?"</span>
 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="green1">shrinking</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>

<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>
 count <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...<span class="blue1">10</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green">// NEST A</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="pink">if</span>
 count % <span class="blue1">2</span>
 == <span class="blue1">0</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST B</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 starString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 starCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 dashString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>

     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

<strong>LOOPING THROUGH RANGES AND COLLECTIONS WITH FOR-IN</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop tells the computer to run the loop over a range of numbers or for each item in a collection. We’ll talk more about collections in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but for now, think of a collection as a group of items—like a bag of marbles or a case of trophies. Let’s see how we loop through a range of numbers first.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00091.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec1">
<strong>SAY HELLO!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to tell the computer something like, “I want to run this bit of code 4 times.” To do this, you write the <span class="code">for</span>
 keyword, followed by a variable to count how many times the loop runs, then the <span class="code">in</span>
 keyword, and finally the range of numbers that you want the loop to run through. Let’s write a simple <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop that prints your name 4 times:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">for</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 number <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue1">1...4</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hello, my name is Colin."</span>
 ) <span class="green">// Use your own name here!</span>
<br />
}</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop begins with the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a variable <span class="ent">➊</span>
 that will be used as a counter to go through the range of numbers. We named our counter variable <span class="code">number</span>
 , but you can give this variable any name you want. After the counter variable comes the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 . This keyword tells the computer to expect a range of integers. After <span class="code">in</span>
 , we provide the range that we want the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to use, <span class="code">1...4</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This is called a <em>closed range</em>
 from <span class="code">1</span>
 to <span class="code">4</span>
 , and it indicates that the count starts at <span class="code">1</span>
 and ends at <span class="code">4</span>
 . The three-dot symbol (<span class="code">...</span>
 ) is the <em>closed range operator</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_49"></span>
 Let’s add a line to our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop so that we can see how <span class="code">number</span>
 increases from 1 through 4. Add the following line right after the line that prints your name inside the loop:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"And the value of number is now</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 number<span class="red">).</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="red">\n"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we use <span class="code">number</span>
 just as we would any other variable. This statement prints a string that contains the value of <span class="code">number</span>
 . To embed variables and constants into strings, you type a backslash and then enter the variable or constant you want to print in parentheses, just like we did at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . This prints the variable’s value with the rest of your string. Pretty cool!</p>
<p class="indent">To make the output prettier, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we also added an empty new line at the end of the sentence by writing the special character for a new line, <span class="code">\n</span>
 . When that sentence is printed, the computer does not print <span class="code">\n</span>
 but instead adds a new line, like when you press <span class="smallcaps">RETURN</span>
 or <span class="smallcaps">ENTER</span>
 on your keyboard.</p>
<p class="indent">Your screen should look like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig1">Figure 4-1</a>

 <em>Figure 4-1: Debug area display of a <span class="code">for-in</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run 4 times. The first time the loop runs, <span class="code">number</span>
 is equal to 1; the second time it runs, it’s equal to 2; and so on until the final loop, when it’s equal to 4. When <span class="code">number</span>
 reaches the end of the range 1 through 4, the loop ends.</p>
<p class="indent">In a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, when the counter, <span class="code">number</span>
 , cycles through the loop, increasing from 1 to 4, we say that the counter <em>iterates</em>
 over the range from 1 to 4. Each time the code inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is run, we call that an <em>iteration</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can change these numbers to set different ranges to loop through. Try it out and see what happens!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec2"><span id="page_50"></span>
 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">

      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Good Morning</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 kidsName<span class="red">)!"</span>
 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>

 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>

 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>

<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>

 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>

 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>
 count <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>

 {<br />
      <span class="green">// NEST A</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="pink">if</span>
 count % <span class="blue1">2</span>
 == <span class="blue1">0</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST B</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 starString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 starCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 dashString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>

     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>

<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>

 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

<strong>LOOPING THROUGH RANGES AND COLLECTIONS WITH FOR-IN</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop tells the computer to run the loop over a range of numbers or for each item in a collection. We’ll talk more about collections in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but for now, think of a collection as a group of items—like a bag of marbles or a case of trophies. Let’s see how we loop through a range of numbers first.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00091.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec1">
<strong>SAY HELLO!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to tell the computer something like, “I want to run this bit of code 4 times.” To do this, you write the <span class="code">for</span>
 keyword, followed by a variable to count how many times the loop runs, then the <span class="code">in</span>
 keyword, and finally the range of numbers that you want the loop to run through. Let’s write a simple <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop that prints your name 4 times:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">for</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 number <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue1">1...4</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hello, my name is Colin."</span>
 ) <span class="green">// Use your own name here!</span>
<br />
}</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop begins with the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a variable <span class="ent">➊</span>
 that will be used as a counter to go through the range of numbers. We named our counter variable <span class="code">number</span>
 , but you can give this variable any name you want. After the counter variable comes the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 . This keyword tells the computer to expect a range of integers. After <span class="code">in</span>
 , we provide the range that we want the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to use, <span class="code">1...4</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This is called a <em>closed range</em>
 from <span class="code">1</span>
 to <span class="code">4</span>
 , and it indicates that the count starts at <span class="code">1</span>
 and ends at <span class="code">4</span>
 . The three-dot symbol (<span class="code">...</span>
 ) is the <em>closed range operator</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_49"></span>
 Let’s add a line to our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop so that we can see how <span class="code">number</span>
 increases from 1 through 4. Add the following line right after the line that prints your name inside the loop:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"And the value of number is now</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 number<span class="red">).</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="red">\n"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we use <span class="code">number</span>
 just as we would any other variable. This statement prints a string that contains the value of <span class="code">number</span>
 . To embed variables and constants into strings, you type a backslash and then enter the variable or constant you want to print in parentheses, just like we did at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . This prints the variable’s value with the rest of your string. Pretty cool!</p>
<p class="indent">To make the output prettier, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we also added an empty new line at the end of the sentence by writing the special character for a new line, <span class="code">\n</span>
 . When that sentence is printed, the computer does not print <span class="code">\n</span>
 but instead adds a new line, like when you press <span class="smallcaps">RETURN</span>
 or <span class="smallcaps">ENTER</span>
 on your keyboard.</p>
<p class="indent">Your screen should look like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig1">Figure 4-1</a>

 over the range from 1 to 4. Each time the code inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is run, we call that an <em>iteration</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can change these numbers to set different ranges to loop through. Try it out and see what happens!</p>

 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">let</span>

 <span class="green1">kidsInClass</span>

      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Good Morning</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 kidsName<span class="red">)!"</span>
 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>

<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>

 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>

      <span class="green">// Guessing a random number</span>

<span class="ent">➎</span>
     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>

 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>

 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>

         <span class="pink">for</span>

 <span class="blue1">1</span>

             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>

<br />
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (dashString)<br />
     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">

</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>

 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>

 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop tells the computer to run the loop over a range of numbers or for each item in a collection. We’ll talk more about collections in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but for now, think of a collection as a group of items—like a bag of marbles or a case of trophies. Let’s see how we loop through a range of numbers first.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00091.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec1">
<strong>SAY HELLO!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to tell the computer something like, “I want to run this bit of code 4 times.” To do this, you write the <span class="code">for</span>
 keyword, followed by a variable to count how many times the loop runs, then the <span class="code">in</span>
 keyword, and finally the range of numbers that you want the loop to run through. Let’s write a simple <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop that prints your name 4 times:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">for</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 number <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue1">1...4</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hello, my name is Colin."</span>
 ) <span class="green">// Use your own name here!</span>
<br />
}</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop begins with the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a variable <span class="ent">➊</span>
 that will be used as a counter to go through the range of numbers. We named our counter variable <span class="code">number</span>
 , but you can give this variable any name you want. After the counter variable comes the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 . This keyword tells the computer to expect a range of integers. After <span class="code">in</span>
 , we provide the range that we want the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to use, <span class="code">1...4</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This is called a <em>closed range</em>
 from <span class="code">1</span>
 to <span class="code">4</span>
 , and it indicates that the count starts at <span class="code">1</span>
 and ends at <span class="code">4</span>
 . The three-dot symbol (<span class="code">...</span>
 ) is the <em>closed range operator</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_49"></span>
 Let’s add a line to our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop so that we can see how <span class="code">number</span>
 increases from 1 through 4. Add the following line right after the line that prints your name inside the loop:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"And the value of number is now</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 number<span class="red">).</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="red">\n"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we use <span class="code">number</span>
 just as we would any other variable. This statement prints a string that contains the value of <span class="code">number</span>
 . To embed variables and constants into strings, you type a backslash and then enter the variable or constant you want to print in parentheses, just like we did at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . This prints the variable’s value with the rest of your string. Pretty cool!</p>
<p class="indent">To make the output prettier, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we also added an empty new line at the end of the sentence by writing the special character for a new line, <span class="code">\n</span>
 . When that sentence is printed, the computer does not print <span class="code">\n</span>
 but instead adds a new line, like when you press <span class="smallcaps">RETURN</span>
 or <span class="smallcaps">ENTER</span>
 on your keyboard.</p>
<p class="indent">Your screen should look like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig1">Figure 4-1</a>
 . If you don’t see the printed text, make sure the debug area is turned on by pressing <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-1: Debug area display of a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run 4 times. The first time the loop runs, <span class="code">number</span>
 is equal to 1; the second time it runs, it’s equal to 2; and so on until the final loop, when it’s equal to 4. When <span class="code">number</span>
 reaches the end of the range 1 through 4, the loop ends.</p>
<p class="indent">In a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, when the counter, <span class="code">number</span>
 , cycles through the loop, increasing from 1 to 4, we say that the counter <em>iterates</em>
 over the range from 1 to 4. Each time the code inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is run, we call that an <em>iteration</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can change these numbers to set different ranges to loop through. Try it out and see what happens!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec2"><span id="page_50"></span>
 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">let</span>
 kidsInClass = [<span class="red">"Gretchen"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Kristina"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Jimmy"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Marcus"</span>
 , <img class="inline" src="Image00093.jpg" />
<br />
      <span class="red">"Helen"</span>

<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>
 kidsName <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="green1">kidsInClass</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Good Morning</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 kidsName<span class="red">)!"</span>
 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 numberIAmThinkingOf = <span class="blue1">7</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Thinking of a number between 1 and 20. Guess what it is."</span>
 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 != <span class="green1">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>

<br />
      <span class="green">// Guessing a random number</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 = <span class="violet">Int</span>
 (<span class="blue">arc4random_uniform</span>
 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)?"</span>
 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">

<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>

<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

<strong>SAY HELLO!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to tell the computer something like, “I want to run this bit of code 4 times.” To do this, you write the <span class="code">for</span>
 keyword, followed by a variable to count how many times the loop runs, then the <span class="code">in</span>
 keyword, and finally the range of numbers that you want the loop to run through. Let’s write a simple <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop that prints your name 4 times:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">for</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 number <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue1">1...4</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hello, my name is Colin."</span>
 ) <span class="green">// Use your own name here!</span>
<br />
}</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop begins with the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a variable <span class="ent">➊</span>
 that will be used as a counter to go through the range of numbers. We named our counter variable <span class="code">number</span>
 , but you can give this variable any name you want. After the counter variable comes the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 . This keyword tells the computer to expect a range of integers. After <span class="code">in</span>
 , we provide the range that we want the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to use, <span class="code">1...4</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This is called a <em>closed range</em>
 from <span class="code">1</span>
 to <span class="code">4</span>
 , and it indicates that the count starts at <span class="code">1</span>
 and ends at <span class="code">4</span>
 . The three-dot symbol (<span class="code">...</span>
 ) is the <em>closed range operator</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_49"></span>
 Let’s add a line to our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop so that we can see how <span class="code">number</span>
 increases from 1 through 4. Add the following line right after the line that prints your name inside the loop:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"And the value of number is now</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 number<span class="red">).</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="red">\n"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we use <span class="code">number</span>
 just as we would any other variable. This statement prints a string that contains the value of <span class="code">number</span>
 . To embed variables and constants into strings, you type a backslash and then enter the variable or constant you want to print in parentheses, just like we did at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . This prints the variable’s value with the rest of your string. Pretty cool!</p>
<p class="indent">To make the output prettier, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we also added an empty new line at the end of the sentence by writing the special character for a new line, <span class="code">\n</span>
 . When that sentence is printed, the computer does not print <span class="code">\n</span>
 but instead adds a new line, like when you press <span class="smallcaps">RETURN</span>
 or <span class="smallcaps">ENTER</span>
 on your keyboard.</p>
<p class="indent">Your screen should look like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig1">Figure 4-1</a>
 . If you don’t see the printed text, make sure the debug area is turned on by pressing <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-1: Debug area display of a <span class="code">for-in</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run 4 times. The first time the loop runs, <span class="code">number</span>
 is equal to 1; the second time it runs, it’s equal to 2; and so on until the final loop, when it’s equal to 4. When <span class="code">number</span>
 reaches the end of the range 1 through 4, the loop ends.</p>
<p class="indent">In a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, when the counter, <span class="code">number</span>
 , cycles through the loop, increasing from 1 to 4, we say that the counter <em>iterates</em>
 over the range from 1 to 4. Each time the code inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is run, we call that an <em>iteration</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can change these numbers to set different ranges to loop through. Try it out and see what happens!</p>

 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>

      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Good Morning</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 kidsName<span class="red">)!"</span>
 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>

<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>

 (<span class="blue1">20</span>

<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>

 <span class="red">)?"</span>
 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>

<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>

 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>

<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="pink">if</span>
 count % <span class="blue1">2</span>
 == <span class="blue1">0</span>

         <span class="green">// NEST B</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 starString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />

         <span class="pink">for</span>
 starCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 dashString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (dashString)<br />
     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec1">
<strong>SAY HELLO!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to tell the computer something like, “I want to run this bit of code 4 times.” To do this, you write the <span class="code">for</span>
 keyword, followed by a variable to count how many times the loop runs, then the <span class="code">in</span>
 keyword, and finally the range of numbers that you want the loop to run through. Let’s write a simple <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop that prints your name 4 times:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">for</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 number <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>

    <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hello, my name is Colin."</span>
 ) <span class="green">// Use your own name here!</span>
<br />
}</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop begins with the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a variable <span class="ent">➊</span>
 that will be used as a counter to go through the range of numbers. We named our counter variable <span class="code">number</span>
 , but you can give this variable any name you want. After the counter variable comes the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 . This keyword tells the computer to expect a range of integers. After <span class="code">in</span>
 , we provide the range that we want the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to use, <span class="code">1...4</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This is called a <em>closed range</em>
 from <span class="code">1</span>
 to <span class="code">4</span>
 , and it indicates that the count starts at <span class="code">1</span>
 and ends at <span class="code">4</span>
 . The three-dot symbol (<span class="code">...</span>
 ) is the <em>closed range operator</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_49"></span>
 Let’s add a line to our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop so that we can see how <span class="code">number</span>
 increases from 1 through 4. Add the following line right after the line that prints your name inside the loop:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"And the value of number is now</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 number<span class="red">).</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="red">\n"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we use <span class="code">number</span>
 just as we would any other variable. This statement prints a string that contains the value of <span class="code">number</span>
 . To embed variables and constants into strings, you type a backslash and then enter the variable or constant you want to print in parentheses, just like we did at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . This prints the variable’s value with the rest of your string. Pretty cool!</p>
<p class="indent">To make the output prettier, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we also added an empty new line at the end of the sentence by writing the special character for a new line, <span class="code">\n</span>
 . When that sentence is printed, the computer does not print <span class="code">\n</span>
 but instead adds a new line, like when you press <span class="smallcaps">RETURN</span>
 or <span class="smallcaps">ENTER</span>
 on your keyboard.</p>
<p class="indent">Your screen should look like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig1">Figure 4-1</a>

<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run 4 times. The first time the loop runs, <span class="code">number</span>
 is equal to 1; the second time it runs, it’s equal to 2; and so on until the final loop, when it’s equal to 4. When <span class="code">number</span>
 reaches the end of the range 1 through 4, the loop ends.</p>
<p class="indent">In a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, when the counter, <span class="code">number</span>
 , cycles through the loop, increasing from 1 to 4, we say that the counter <em>iterates</em>
 over the range from 1 to 4. Each time the code inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>

 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can change these numbers to set different ranges to loop through. Try it out and see what happens!</p>

 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>

 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>

 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 numberIAmThinkingOf = <span class="blue1">7</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Thinking of a number between 1 and 20. Guess what it is."</span>
 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>

<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>

  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>

  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>
 count <span class="pink">in</span>

 {<br />
      <span class="green">// NEST A</span>

<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="pink">if</span>
 count % <span class="blue1">2</span>
 == <span class="blue1">0</span>

<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>

         <span class="pink">for</span>

 <span class="blue1">1</span>

             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 dashString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (dashString)<br />
     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>

<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>

 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>

<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>

<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>

 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">You can use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to tell the computer something like, “I want to run this bit of code 4 times.” To do this, you write the <span class="code">for</span>
 keyword, followed by a variable to count how many times the loop runs, then the <span class="code">in</span>
 keyword, and finally the range of numbers that you want the loop to run through. Let’s write a simple <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop that prints your name 4 times:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">for</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 number <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue1">1...4</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hello, my name is Colin."</span>
 ) <span class="green">// Use your own name here!</span>
<br />
}</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop begins with the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a variable <span class="ent">➊</span>
 that will be used as a counter to go through the range of numbers. We named our counter variable <span class="code">number</span>
 , but you can give this variable any name you want. After the counter variable comes the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 . This keyword tells the computer to expect a range of integers. After <span class="code">in</span>
 , we provide the range that we want the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to use, <span class="code">1...4</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This is called a <em>closed range</em>
 from <span class="code">1</span>
 to <span class="code">4</span>
 , and it indicates that the count starts at <span class="code">1</span>
 and ends at <span class="code">4</span>
 . The three-dot symbol (<span class="code">...</span>
 ) is the <em>closed range operator</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_49"></span>
 Let’s add a line to our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop so that we can see how <span class="code">number</span>
 increases from 1 through 4. Add the following line right after the line that prints your name inside the loop:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"And the value of number is now</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 number<span class="red">).</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="red">\n"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we use <span class="code">number</span>
 just as we would any other variable. This statement prints a string that contains the value of <span class="code">number</span>
 . To embed variables and constants into strings, you type a backslash and then enter the variable or constant you want to print in parentheses, just like we did at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . This prints the variable’s value with the rest of your string. Pretty cool!</p>
<p class="indent">To make the output prettier, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we also added an empty new line at the end of the sentence by writing the special character for a new line, <span class="code">\n</span>
 . When that sentence is printed, the computer does not print <span class="code">\n</span>
 but instead adds a new line, like when you press <span class="smallcaps">RETURN</span>
 or <span class="smallcaps">ENTER</span>
 on your keyboard.</p>
<p class="indent">Your screen should look like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig1">Figure 4-1</a>

<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run 4 times. The first time the loop runs, <span class="code">number</span>
 is equal to 1; the second time it runs, it’s equal to 2; and so on until the final loop, when it’s equal to 4. When <span class="code">number</span>
 reaches the end of the range 1 through 4, the loop ends.</p>
<p class="indent">In a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, when the counter, <span class="code">number</span>
 , cycles through the loop, increasing from 1 to 4, we say that the counter <em>iterates</em>
 over the range from 1 to 4. Each time the code inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>

 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">let</span>

      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Good Morning</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 kidsName<span class="red">)!"</span>
 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>

<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>

     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>

 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>

  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="green1">shrinking</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">

         }<br />

         <span class="blue">print</span>

<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />

             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>

     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>

<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>

 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">for</span>

 {<br />
    <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hello, my name is Colin."</span>
 ) <span class="green">// Use your own name here!</span>
<br />
}</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop begins with the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a variable <span class="ent">➊</span>
 that will be used as a counter to go through the range of numbers. We named our counter variable <span class="code">number</span>
 , but you can give this variable any name you want. After the counter variable comes the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 . This keyword tells the computer to expect a range of integers. After <span class="code">in</span>
 , we provide the range that we want the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to use, <span class="code">1...4</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This is called a <em>closed range</em>
 from <span class="code">1</span>
 to <span class="code">4</span>
 , and it indicates that the count starts at <span class="code">1</span>
 and ends at <span class="code">4</span>
 . The three-dot symbol (<span class="code">...</span>
 ) is the <em>closed range operator</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_49"></span>
 Let’s add a line to our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop so that we can see how <span class="code">number</span>
 increases from 1 through 4. Add the following line right after the line that prints your name inside the loop:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"And the value of number is now</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 number<span class="red">).</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="red">\n"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we use <span class="code">number</span>
 just as we would any other variable. This statement prints a string that contains the value of <span class="code">number</span>
 . To embed variables and constants into strings, you type a backslash and then enter the variable or constant you want to print in parentheses, just like we did at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . This prints the variable’s value with the rest of your string. Pretty cool!</p>
<p class="indent">To make the output prettier, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we also added an empty new line at the end of the sentence by writing the special character for a new line, <span class="code">\n</span>
 . When that sentence is printed, the computer does not print <span class="code">\n</span>
 but instead adds a new line, like when you press <span class="smallcaps">RETURN</span>
 or <span class="smallcaps">ENTER</span>
 on your keyboard.</p>
<p class="indent">Your screen should look like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig1">Figure 4-1</a>

 <em>Figure 4-1: Debug area display of a <span class="code">for-in</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run 4 times. The first time the loop runs, <span class="code">number</span>
 is equal to 1; the second time it runs, it’s equal to 2; and so on until the final loop, when it’s equal to 4. When <span class="code">number</span>
 reaches the end of the range 1 through 4, the loop ends.</p>
<p class="indent">In a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, when the counter, <span class="code">number</span>
 , cycles through the loop, increasing from 1 to 4, we say that the counter <em>iterates</em>
 over the range from 1 to 4. Each time the code inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is run, we call that an <em>iteration</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can change these numbers to set different ranges to loop through. Try it out and see what happens!</p>

 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">let</span>
 kidsInClass = [<span class="red">"Gretchen"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Kristina"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Jimmy"</span>

 <span class="green1">kidsInClass</span>

<span class="ent">➌</span>
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Good Morning</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 kidsName<span class="red">)!"</span>
 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 numberIAmThinkingOf = <span class="blue1">7</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Thinking of a number between 1 and 20. Guess what it is."</span>
 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>

<br />
      <span class="green">// Guessing a random number</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>

 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)?"</span>
 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="green1">shrinking</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>

<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop begins with the keyword <span class="code">for</span>
 , followed by a variable <span class="ent">➊</span>
 that will be used as a counter to go through the range of numbers. We named our counter variable <span class="code">number</span>
 , but you can give this variable any name you want. After the counter variable comes the keyword <span class="code">in</span>
 . This keyword tells the computer to expect a range of integers. After <span class="code">in</span>
 , we provide the range that we want the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to use, <span class="code">1...4</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 . This is called a <em>closed range</em>
 from <span class="code">1</span>
 to <span class="code">4</span>
 , and it indicates that the count starts at <span class="code">1</span>
 and ends at <span class="code">4</span>
 . The three-dot symbol (<span class="code">...</span>
 ) is the <em>closed range operator</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_49"></span>
 Let’s add a line to our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop so that we can see how <span class="code">number</span>
 increases from 1 through 4. Add the following line right after the line that prints your name inside the loop:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"And the value of number is now</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 number<span class="red">).</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="red">\n"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we use <span class="code">number</span>
 just as we would any other variable. This statement prints a string that contains the value of <span class="code">number</span>
 . To embed variables and constants into strings, you type a backslash and then enter the variable or constant you want to print in parentheses, just like we did at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . This prints the variable’s value with the rest of your string. Pretty cool!</p>
<p class="indent">To make the output prettier, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we also added an empty new line at the end of the sentence by writing the special character for a new line, <span class="code">\n</span>
 . When that sentence is printed, the computer does not print <span class="code">\n</span>
 but instead adds a new line, like when you press <span class="smallcaps">RETURN</span>
 or <span class="smallcaps">ENTER</span>
 on your keyboard.</p>
<p class="indent">Your screen should look like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig1">Figure 4-1</a>
 . If you don’t see the printed text, make sure the debug area is turned on by pressing <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-1: Debug area display of a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run 4 times. The first time the loop runs, <span class="code">number</span>
 is equal to 1; the second time it runs, it’s equal to 2; and so on until the final loop, when it’s equal to 4. When <span class="code">number</span>
 reaches the end of the range 1 through 4, the loop ends.</p>
<p class="indent">In a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, when the counter, <span class="code">number</span>
 , cycles through the loop, increasing from 1 to 4, we say that the counter <em>iterates</em>
 over the range from 1 to 4. Each time the code inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is run, we call that an <em>iteration</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can change these numbers to set different ranges to loop through. Try it out and see what happens!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec2"><span id="page_50"></span>
 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">let</span>
 kidsInClass = [<span class="red">"Gretchen"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Kristina"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Jimmy"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Marcus"</span>
 , <img class="inline" src="Image00093.jpg" />

 <span class="pink">for</span>

 <span class="green1">kidsInClass</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Good Morning</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 kidsName<span class="red">)!"</span>
 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec3">
<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 numberIAmThinkingOf = <span class="blue1">7</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Thinking of a number between 1 and 20. Guess what it is."</span>
 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 != <span class="green1">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>

      <span class="green">// Guessing a random number</span>

<span class="ent">➎</span>
     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>

 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)?"</span>
 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>

  }<br />

<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>
 count <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...<span class="blue1">10</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green">// NEST A</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="pink">if</span>
 count % <span class="blue1">2</span>
 == <span class="blue1">0</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST B</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 starString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 starCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 dashString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (dashString)<br />
     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec6">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_49"></span>
 Let’s add a line to our <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop so that we can see how <span class="code">number</span>
 increases from 1 through 4. Add the following line right after the line that prints your name inside the loop:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"And the value of number is now</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 number<span class="red">).</span>
 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="red">\n"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we use <span class="code">number</span>
 just as we would any other variable. This statement prints a string that contains the value of <span class="code">number</span>
 . To embed variables and constants into strings, you type a backslash and then enter the variable or constant you want to print in parentheses, just like we did at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . This prints the variable’s value with the rest of your string. Pretty cool!</p>
<p class="indent">To make the output prettier, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we also added an empty new line at the end of the sentence by writing the special character for a new line, <span class="code">\n</span>
 . When that sentence is printed, the computer does not print <span class="code">\n</span>
 but instead adds a new line, like when you press <span class="smallcaps">RETURN</span>
 or <span class="smallcaps">ENTER</span>
 on your keyboard.</p>
<p class="indent">Your screen should look like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig1">Figure 4-1</a>
 . If you don’t see the printed text, make sure the debug area is turned on by pressing <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y.</p>

<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-1: Debug area display of a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run 4 times. The first time the loop runs, <span class="code">number</span>
 is equal to 1; the second time it runs, it’s equal to 2; and so on until the final loop, when it’s equal to 4. When <span class="code">number</span>
 reaches the end of the range 1 through 4, the loop ends.</p>
<p class="indent">In a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, when the counter, <span class="code">number</span>
 , cycles through the loop, increasing from 1 to 4, we say that the counter <em>iterates</em>
 over the range from 1 to 4. Each time the code inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is run, we call that an <em>iteration</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can change these numbers to set different ranges to loop through. Try it out and see what happens!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec2"><span id="page_50"></span>
 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">let</span>
 kidsInClass = [<span class="red">"Gretchen"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Kristina"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Jimmy"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Marcus"</span>
 , <img class="inline" src="Image00093.jpg" />
<br />
      <span class="red">"Helen"</span>

<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>
 kidsName <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="green1">kidsInClass</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Good Morning</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 kidsName<span class="red">)!"</span>
 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec3">
<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />

</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>

</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>

<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>

         <span class="pink">for</span>

 <span class="blue1">1</span>

             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>

<br />
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>

             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>

     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>

<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>

 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

 <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="red">\n"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we use <span class="code">number</span>
 just as we would any other variable. This statement prints a string that contains the value of <span class="code">number</span>
 . To embed variables and constants into strings, you type a backslash and then enter the variable or constant you want to print in parentheses, just like we did at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . This prints the variable’s value with the rest of your string. Pretty cool!</p>
<p class="indent">To make the output prettier, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we also added an empty new line at the end of the sentence by writing the special character for a new line, <span class="code">\n</span>
 . When that sentence is printed, the computer does not print <span class="code">\n</span>
 but instead adds a new line, like when you press <span class="smallcaps">RETURN</span>

 on your keyboard.</p>

 reaches the end of the range 1 through 4, the loop ends.</p>
<p class="indent">In a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, when the counter, <span class="code">number</span>
 , cycles through the loop, increasing from 1 to 4, we say that the counter <em>iterates</em>
 over the range from 1 to 4. Each time the code inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>

 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can change these numbers to set different ranges to loop through. Try it out and see what happens!</p>

 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>

<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>

      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Good Morning</span>

 kidsName<span class="red">)!"</span>
 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>

<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>

      <span class="green">// Guessing a random number</span>

     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>

 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>

 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>

  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>

         <span class="pink">for</span>

 <span class="blue1">1</span>

             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 dashString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (dashString)<br />
     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>

 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>

 is.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we use <span class="code">number</span>
 just as we would any other variable. This statement prints a string that contains the value of <span class="code">number</span>
 . To embed variables and constants into strings, you type a backslash and then enter the variable or constant you want to print in parentheses, just like we did at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . This prints the variable’s value with the rest of your string. Pretty cool!</p>
<p class="indent">To make the output prettier, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we also added an empty new line at the end of the sentence by writing the special character for a new line, <span class="code">\n</span>
 . When that sentence is printed, the computer does not print <span class="code">\n</span>
 but instead adds a new line, like when you press <span class="smallcaps">RETURN</span>
 or <span class="smallcaps">ENTER</span>
 on your keyboard.</p>
<p class="indent">Your screen should look like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig1">Figure 4-1</a>
 . If you don’t see the printed text, make sure the debug area is turned on by pressing <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y.</p>

<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-1: Debug area display of a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run 4 times. The first time the loop runs, <span class="code">number</span>
 is equal to 1; the second time it runs, it’s equal to 2; and so on until the final loop, when it’s equal to 4. When <span class="code">number</span>
 reaches the end of the range 1 through 4, the loop ends.</p>
<p class="indent">In a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, when the counter, <span class="code">number</span>
 , cycles through the loop, increasing from 1 to 4, we say that the counter <em>iterates</em>
 over the range from 1 to 4. Each time the code inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is run, we call that an <em>iteration</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can change these numbers to set different ranges to loop through. Try it out and see what happens!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec2"><span id="page_50"></span>
 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">let</span>
 kidsInClass = [<span class="red">"Gretchen"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Kristina"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Jimmy"</span>

 , <img class="inline" src="Image00093.jpg" />

 <span class="pink">for</span>

 <span class="green1">kidsInClass</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Good Morning</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 kidsName<span class="red">)!"</span>
 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 numberIAmThinkingOf = <span class="blue1">7</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Thinking of a number between 1 and 20. Guess what it is."</span>
 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 != <span class="green1">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 {<br />
<br />
      <span class="green">// Guessing a random number</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 = <span class="violet">Int</span>
 (<span class="blue">arc4random_uniform</span>
 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)?"</span>
 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="green1">shrinking</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>

             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>

<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>

             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (dashString)<br />
     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">To make the output prettier, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we also added an empty new line at the end of the sentence by writing the special character for a new line, <span class="code">\n</span>
 . When that sentence is printed, the computer does not print <span class="code">\n</span>
 but instead adds a new line, like when you press <span class="smallcaps">RETURN</span>
 or <span class="smallcaps">ENTER</span>
 on your keyboard.</p>
<p class="indent">Your screen should look like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig1">Figure 4-1</a>
 . If you don’t see the printed text, make sure the debug area is turned on by pressing <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y.</p>

<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-1: Debug area display of a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run 4 times. The first time the loop runs, <span class="code">number</span>
 is equal to 1; the second time it runs, it’s equal to 2; and so on until the final loop, when it’s equal to 4. When <span class="code">number</span>
 reaches the end of the range 1 through 4, the loop ends.</p>
<p class="indent">In a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, when the counter, <span class="code">number</span>
 , cycles through the loop, increasing from 1 to 4, we say that the counter <em>iterates</em>
 over the range from 1 to 4. Each time the code inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is run, we call that an <em>iteration</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can change these numbers to set different ranges to loop through. Try it out and see what happens!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec2"><span id="page_50"></span>
 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">let</span>
 kidsInClass = [<span class="red">"Gretchen"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Kristina"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Jimmy"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Marcus"</span>
 , <img class="inline" src="Image00093.jpg" />

 <span class="green1">kidsInClass</span>

<span class="ent">➌</span>
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Good Morning</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 kidsName<span class="red">)!"</span>
 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 numberIAmThinkingOf = <span class="blue1">7</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Thinking of a number between 1 and 20. Guess what it is."</span>
 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 != <span class="green1">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 {<br />
<br />
      <span class="green">// Guessing a random number</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 = <span class="violet">Int</span>
 (<span class="blue">arc4random_uniform</span>
 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)?"</span>
 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>
 count <span class="pink">in</span>

<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>

<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

<p class="indent">Your screen should look like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig1">Figure 4-1</a>

 <em>Figure 4-1: Debug area display of a <span class="code">for-in</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run 4 times. The first time the loop runs, <span class="code">number</span>
 is equal to 1; the second time it runs, it’s equal to 2; and so on until the final loop, when it’s equal to 4. When <span class="code">number</span>
 reaches the end of the range 1 through 4, the loop ends.</p>
<p class="indent">In a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, when the counter, <span class="code">number</span>
 , cycles through the loop, increasing from 1 to 4, we say that the counter <em>iterates</em>
 over the range from 1 to 4. Each time the code inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is run, we call that an <em>iteration</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can change these numbers to set different ranges to loop through. Try it out and see what happens!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec2"><span id="page_50"></span>
 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">let</span>
 kidsInClass = [<span class="red">"Gretchen"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Kristina"</span>

      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Good Morning</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 kidsName<span class="red">)!"</span>
 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 numberIAmThinkingOf = <span class="blue1">7</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Thinking of a number between 1 and 20. Guess what it is."</span>
 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 != <span class="green1">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>

<br />
      <span class="green">// Guessing a random number</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 = <span class="violet">Int</span>
 (<span class="blue">arc4random_uniform</span>
 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)?"</span>
 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>

<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>

      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>

 <span class="violet">String</span>

 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>

<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>

 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>
 count <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...<span class="blue1">10</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green">// NEST A</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="pink">if</span>
 count % <span class="blue1">2</span>
 == <span class="blue1">0</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST B</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 starString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 starCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 dashString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (dashString)<br />
     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

 <em>Figure 4-1: Debug area display of a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run 4 times. The first time the loop runs, <span class="code">number</span>
 is equal to 1; the second time it runs, it’s equal to 2; and so on until the final loop, when it’s equal to 4. When <span class="code">number</span>
 reaches the end of the range 1 through 4, the loop ends.</p>
<p class="indent">In a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, when the counter, <span class="code">number</span>
 , cycles through the loop, increasing from 1 to 4, we say that the counter <em>iterates</em>
 over the range from 1 to 4. Each time the code inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is run, we call that an <em>iteration</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can change these numbers to set different ranges to loop through. Try it out and see what happens!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec2"><span id="page_50"></span>
 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">let</span>
 kidsInClass = [<span class="red">"Gretchen"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Kristina"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Jimmy"</span>

 <span class="pink">for</span>

 <span class="green1">kidsInClass</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Good Morning</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 kidsName<span class="red">)!"</span>
 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 numberIAmThinkingOf = <span class="blue1">7</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Thinking of a number between 1 and 20. Guess what it is."</span>
 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 != <span class="green1">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 {<br />
<br />
      <span class="green">// Guessing a random number</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>

 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)?"</span>
 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>

<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>

 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>

     <span class="pink">if</span>
 count % <span class="blue1">2</span>
 == <span class="blue1">0</span>

         <span class="pink">for</span>
 starCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 dashString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>

             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (dashString)<br />
     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

 <em>Figure 4-1: Debug area display of a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run 4 times. The first time the loop runs, <span class="code">number</span>
 is equal to 1; the second time it runs, it’s equal to 2; and so on until the final loop, when it’s equal to 4. When <span class="code">number</span>
 reaches the end of the range 1 through 4, the loop ends.</p>
<p class="indent">In a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, when the counter, <span class="code">number</span>
 , cycles through the loop, increasing from 1 to 4, we say that the counter <em>iterates</em>
 over the range from 1 to 4. Each time the code inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is run, we call that an <em>iteration</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can change these numbers to set different ranges to loop through. Try it out and see what happens!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec2"><span id="page_50"></span>
 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>
<div class="box">

 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>

 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>

 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="green1">shrinking</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>
 count <span class="pink">in</span>

 {<br />
      <span class="green">// NEST A</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="pink">if</span>
 count % <span class="blue1">2</span>
 == <span class="blue1">0</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST B</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 starString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 starCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 dashString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (dashString)<br />
     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>

 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop will run 4 times. The first time the loop runs, <span class="code">number</span>
 is equal to 1; the second time it runs, it’s equal to 2; and so on until the final loop, when it’s equal to 4. When <span class="code">number</span>
 reaches the end of the range 1 through 4, the loop ends.</p>
<p class="indent">In a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, when the counter, <span class="code">number</span>
 , cycles through the loop, increasing from 1 to 4, we say that the counter <em>iterates</em>
 over the range from 1 to 4. Each time the code inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is run, we call that an <em>iteration</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can change these numbers to set different ranges to loop through. Try it out and see what happens!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec2"><span id="page_50"></span>
 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">let</span>
 kidsInClass = [<span class="red">"Gretchen"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Kristina"</span>

 , <span class="red">"Marcus"</span>
 , <img class="inline" src="Image00093.jpg" />

<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>
 kidsName <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="green1">kidsInClass</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Good Morning</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 kidsName<span class="red">)!"</span>
 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">

</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>

<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>

      <span class="blue">print</span>

</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>

         <span class="pink">for</span>

 <span class="blue1">1</span>

             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 dashString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (dashString)<br />
     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>

<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>

 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">In a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, when the counter, <span class="code">number</span>
 , cycles through the loop, increasing from 1 to 4, we say that the counter <em>iterates</em>
 over the range from 1 to 4. Each time the code inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is run, we call that an <em>iteration</em>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can change these numbers to set different ranges to loop through. Try it out and see what happens!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec2"><span id="page_50"></span>
 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>

 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>

<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Thinking of a number between 1 and 20. Guess what it is."</span>
 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>

     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>

 (<span class="blue1">20</span>

<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>

 <span class="red">)?"</span>
 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>

  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>

 <span class="blue1">1</span>

             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 dashString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (dashString)<br />
     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>

 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>

 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">let</span>
 kidsInClass = [<span class="red">"Gretchen"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Kristina"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Jimmy"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Marcus"</span>
 , <img class="inline" src="Image00093.jpg" />
<br />
      <span class="red">"Helen"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Eric"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Alex"</span>

<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>
 kidsName <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="green1">kidsInClass</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Good Morning</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 kidsName<span class="red">)!"</span>
 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 numberIAmThinkingOf = <span class="blue1">7</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Thinking of a number between 1 and 20. Guess what it is."</span>
 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>

<br />
      <span class="green">// Guessing a random number</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>

 (<span class="blue">arc4random_uniform</span>
 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)?"</span>
 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="green1">shrinking</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>

         <span class="pink">for</span>

 <span class="blue1">1</span>

             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>

<br />
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (dashString)<br />
     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">

</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>

 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>

 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>

<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>

<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>

</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>

 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>

 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

 <strong>SAY GOOD MORNING!</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">let</span>
 kidsInClass = [<span class="red">"Gretchen"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Kristina"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Jimmy"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Marcus"</span>
 , <img class="inline" src="Image00093.jpg" />
<br />
      <span class="red">"Helen"</span>

<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>
 kidsName <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="green1">kidsInClass</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Good Morning</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 kidsName<span class="red">)!"</span>
 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 numberIAmThinkingOf = <span class="blue1">7</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Thinking of a number between 1 and 20. Guess what it is."</span>
 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>

<br />
      <span class="green">// Guessing a random number</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>

 (<span class="blue">arc4random_uniform</span>
 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)?"</span>
 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="green1">shrinking</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">

 <span class="pink">for</span>

             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>

         <span class="pink">for</span>

 <span class="blue1">1</span>

             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>

     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>

<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>

<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">In addition to looping through a range of numbers, the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is useful for looping through collections. Here, you’ll use a collection called an <em>array</em>
 . We’ll talk more about arrays in <a href="text00016.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>
 , but all you need to know right now is that an array is a list of items stored in a constant or variable. When you use a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to go through an array, you’re telling your computer “for each item in the array, do something!” Let’s write code that greets kids.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">let</span>
 kidsInClass = [<span class="red">"Gretchen"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Kristina"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Jimmy"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Marcus"</span>
 , <img class="inline" src="Image00093.jpg" />
<br />
      <span class="red">"Helen"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Eric"</span>
 , <span class="red">"Alex"</span>

<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>
 kidsName <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="green1">kidsInClass</span>
 {<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Good Morning</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 kidsName<span class="red">)!"</span>
 )<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 numberIAmThinkingOf = <span class="blue1">7</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Thinking of a number between 1 and 20. Guess what it is."</span>
 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 != <span class="green1">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>

<br />
      <span class="green">// Guessing a random number</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 = <span class="violet">Int</span>
 (<span class="blue">arc4random_uniform</span>
 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)?"</span>
 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="green1">shrinking</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>

     <span class="pink">if</span>

 <span class="blue1">1</span>

             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>

             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>

         <span class="pink">for</span>

             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (dashString)<br />
     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>

<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>

 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>

 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />

  <span class="blue">print</span>

     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>

<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>

  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>

      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>

 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>

  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>

 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>

         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>

             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>

</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>

<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we make our array called <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 , which contains seven strings. The square brackets tell the computer that we’re creating an array, and each string in our array is separated by a comma. (The arrow means that a long line has wrapped on the page—you don’t need to enter the arrow.)</p>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 numberIAmThinkingOf = <span class="blue1">7</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Thinking of a number between 1 and 20. Guess what it is."</span>
 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 != <span class="green1">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 {<br />
<br />
      <span class="green">// Guessing a random number</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>

 (<span class="blue">arc4random_uniform</span>
 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)?"</span>
 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="green1">shrinking</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>
 count <span class="pink">in</span>

 {<br />
      <span class="green">// NEST A</span>

     <span class="pink">if</span>

         <span class="pink">for</span>
 starCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>

<br />
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>

             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (dashString)<br />
     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>

<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>

<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>

 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">To print “Good Morning <em>kidsName</em>
 !” for each name in the <span class="code">kidsInClass</span>
 array, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we write <span class="code">for kidsName in kidsInClass</span>
 , followed by braces and our code. The code inside the braces will run once for each item in the array. These kinds of loops always follow the format <span class="code">for</span>
 <em>constantName</em>
 <span class="code">in</span>
 <em>collectionName</em>
 , where <em>constantName</em>
 is a name you choose to call each item from the collection inside the loop.</p>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 numberIAmThinkingOf = <span class="blue1">7</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Thinking of a number between 1 and 20. Guess what it is."</span>
 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 != <span class="green1">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>

<br />
      <span class="green">// Guessing a random number</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 = <span class="violet">Int</span>
 (<span class="blue">arc4random_uniform</span>
 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)?"</span>
 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>

      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>

 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>

 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">

 <span class="pink">for</span>

 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , inside the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, we write the code to print a greeting for each name. To do that, we use <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 just like it’s any other constant. <span class="code">kidsName</span>
 exists only inside the braces of this loop, and it temporarily stores the current kid’s name as the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop loops through the array. This way, we can print each name on each cycle of the loop to wish everyone a good morning!</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec3">
<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 numberIAmThinkingOf = <span class="blue1">7</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Thinking of a number between 1 and 20. Guess what it is."</span>
 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 != <span class="green1">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 {<br />
<br />
      <span class="green">// Guessing a random number</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 = <span class="violet">Int</span>
 (<span class="blue">arc4random_uniform</span>
 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)?"</span>
 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="green1">shrinking</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>

         <span class="pink">for</span>
 starCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>

         <span class="blue">print</span>

<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>

         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>

<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>

<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>

<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>

 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 numberIAmThinkingOf = <span class="blue1">7</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Thinking of a number between 1 and 20. Guess what it is."</span>
 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 != <span class="green1">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 {<br />
<br />
      <span class="green">// Guessing a random number</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 = <span class="violet">Int</span>
 (<span class="blue">arc4random_uniform</span>
 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)?"</span>
 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>

  }<br />

 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">

         <span class="blue">print</span>

<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>

         }<br />

<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>

<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>

<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec3">
<strong>TESTING CONDITIONS WITH WHILE LOOPS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 numberIAmThinkingOf = <span class="blue1">7</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Thinking of a number between 1 and 20. Guess what it is."</span>
 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 != <span class="green1">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 {<br />
<br />
      <span class="green">// Guessing a random number</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 = <span class="violet">Int</span>
 (<span class="blue">arc4random_uniform</span>
 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)?"</span>
 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>

  }<br />

 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>

         <span class="blue">print</span>

<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>

         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>

             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>

     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>

<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>

<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>

<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>

 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is great when you know how many times you want the computer to do something, but sometimes you might want the computer to do something over and over until a specific condition is met. For that, you should use a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 numberIAmThinkingOf = <span class="blue1">7</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Thinking of a number between 1 and 20. Guess what it is."</span>
 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 != <span class="green1">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 {<br />
<br />
      <span class="green">// Guessing a random number</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 = <span class="violet">Int</span>
 (<span class="blue">arc4random_uniform</span>
 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)?"</span>
 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="green1">shrinking</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">

         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>

<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>

         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>

     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>

<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>

<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>

 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">There are two kinds of <span class="code">while</span>
 loops: <span class="code">while</span>
 and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 . Both contain blocks of code that will be executed over and over again as long as a condition is true. The difference between the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is that the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>before</em>
 it runs its block of code, and the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop checks the condition <em>after</em>
 it runs its block of code. Let’s look at some examples to see how each works!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec3"><span id="page_51"></span>
 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 numberIAmThinkingOf = <span class="blue1">7</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Thinking of a number between 1 and 20. Guess what it is."</span>
 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 != <span class="green1">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 {<br />
<br />
      <span class="green">// Guessing a random number</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 = <span class="violet">Int</span>
 (<span class="blue">arc4random_uniform</span>
 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)?"</span>
 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="green1">shrinking</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>

             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>

         <span class="pink">for</span>

 <span class="blue1">1</span>

             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (dashString)<br />
     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>

<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>

<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>

</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

 <strong>GUESS MY NUMBER</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 numberIAmThinkingOf = <span class="blue1">7</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Thinking of a number between 1 and 20. Guess what it is."</span>
 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>

      <span class="green">// Guessing a random number</span>

     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>

 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>

 <span class="red">)?"</span>
 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>

  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>

     <span class="pink">if</span>

<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>

         <span class="pink">for</span>

 <span class="blue1">1</span>

             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>

<br />
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>

     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>

 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>

 is.</p>

</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop keeps doing something until a certain condition is true. This works well for a guessing game, such as when you think of a number and make a friend guess what it is until they get it right. We can write a program that does this! You’ll pick a number between 1 and 20, and the computer will try to guess what it is. Write the following code in a new playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">let</span>
 numberIAmThinkingOf = <span class="blue1">7</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 currentGuess = -<span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Thinking of a number between 1 and 20. Guess what it is."</span>
 )<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="ent">➍</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>

     <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>

 (<span class="blue1">20</span>
 )) + <span class="blue1">1</span>
<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"Hmmm... let me guess. Is it</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)?"</span>
 )<br />
  }<br />
<br />
  <span class="green">// The right answer</span>
<br />
  <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="red">"You guessed my number! The correct guess was</span>
 \<span class="red">(</span>
 <span class="green1">currentGuess</span>
 <span class="red">)!"</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="green1">shrinking</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>
 count <span class="pink">in</span>

 {<br />
      <span class="green">// NEST A</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="pink">if</span>
 count % <span class="blue1">2</span>
 == <span class="blue1">0</span>

         <span class="green">// NEST B</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 starString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 starCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 dashString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (dashString)<br />
     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">

</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>

 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>

 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>

  }<br />

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>

             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>

<br />
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>

             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>

             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>

     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>

<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>

<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>

 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

<p class="indent">In this example, we use a special library, called the Foundation framework, that has the function we need to create a random number. To use this library, we write the line <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 at the top of our playground. (We’ll discuss functions in more detail in <a href="text00017.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>
 .)</p>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>

<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>

</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>
 count <span class="pink">in</span>

 {<br />
      <span class="green">// NEST A</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="pink">if</span>
 count % <span class="blue1">2</span>
 == <span class="blue1">0</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST B</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 starString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 starCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 dashString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (dashString)<br />
     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec6">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Next, we create a constant called <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 and set it to be any number between 1 and 20. Then, at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , we create a variable called <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 to represent the computer’s guess and set it to <span class="code">-1</span>
 . Setting the <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 variable to <span class="code">-1</span>
 is a good way to indicate that the computer hasn’t guessed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>

<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>

  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec6">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">The <span class="code">while</span>
 loop starts with the keyword <span class="code">while</span>
 at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 , followed by a condition at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 . In this case, the condition checks whether <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 is not equal to <span class="code">numberIAmThinkingOf</span>
 . If the condition is <span class="code">true</span>
 , that means the computer still hasn’t correctly guessed our secret number, and the statements inside the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop run.</p>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>

 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>

 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>

<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>

<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>

 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>

<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Because the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop depends on a condition, it’s really important that you include some way for the condition to change <em>inside</em>
 the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, or it will run forever and never get to the next part of your program! Unlike a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop doesn’t have a counter that automatically increases or decreases. It’s up to you to control it!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>

<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>

 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>

 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

</body>
</html>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00095.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We do that at <span class="ent">➎</span>
 by having the computer guess a new number between 1 and 20 and then put that new number into <span class="code">currentGuess</span>
 . Don’t worry too much about completely understanding the line of code that does that; just <span id="page_52"></span>
 know that <span class="code">Int(arc4random_uniform(20))</span>
 will create a random integer between 0 and 19, and we add a <span class="code">+ 1</span>
 at the end of that line so we end up with a number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>
 count <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...<span class="blue1">10</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green">// NEST A</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="pink">if</span>
 count % <span class="blue1">2</span>
 == <span class="blue1">0</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST B</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 starString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 starCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 dashString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (dashString)<br />
     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>

<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">

         <span class="blue">print</span>

</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

<p class="indent">If you find that you’ve accidentally gotten yourself stuck in a loop that is running forever, the best thing to do is to comment out the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword by putting two slashes in front of it. That will stop the loop so you can figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>

<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>

<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>

 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>

 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>

<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>

<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>

<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">When the computer finally guesses the correct number, the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop ends and a nice message is printed to the console. The output should look something like <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">

 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>

 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>

<p class="indent">When you typed this program into a playground, how many times did your loop run? It’s likely a different number of times than in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig2">Figure 4-2</a>
 . This number-guessing program is an example of something you can do with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop that you couldn’t do with a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. We have no way of knowing how many random guesses it will take until the computer gets the correct number, so we couldn’t write a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop to do this. A <span class="code">while</span>
 loop lets the computer keep guessing as many times as it needs until it gets the right answer.</p>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>

  }<br />

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>
 count <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>

 {<br />
      <span class="green">// NEST A</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="pink">if</span>
 count % <span class="blue1">2</span>
 == <span class="blue1">0</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST B</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 starString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 starCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 dashString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (dashString)<br />
     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>

 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>

<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>

<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>

<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>

</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>

 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>

 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>

 <span class="blue">print</span>

<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

<strong>SHRINK AWAY</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop is very similar to the <span class="code">while</span>
 loop except it’s written differently and the condition to end the loop is checked <em>after</em>
 the loop runs. We will test the <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">import</span>
 Foundation<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">var</span>
 shrinking = <span class="red">"Help! I'm shrinking away!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">repeat</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 )<br />
      <span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 = <span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="violet">String</span>
 (<span class="green1">shrinking</span>
 .<span class="violet">characters</span>
 .<span class="blue">dropLast</span>
 ())<br />
  }<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
 <span class="pink">while</span>
 <span class="green1">shrinking</span>

 .<span class="violet">count</span>
 &gt; <span class="blue1">0</span>
</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">

<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>

 loop by deleting the letters in a sentence until it disappears.</p>
<p class="indent">Try out the following code:</p>

 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>

</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>

<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>

<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">

<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>

</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>

 is.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>

<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>

<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>

 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

</html>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_53"></span>
 In this example, we need to use a method that chops off the last character in a string. We need that same Foundation framework that we used in our guessing game, so enter <span class="code">import</span>
 <span class="code">Foundation</span>
 at the top of your playground. (We’ll discuss methods in more detail in <a href="text00018.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>
 .)</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00097.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>
 count <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>

 {<br />
      <span class="green">// NEST A</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
     <span class="pink">if</span>
 count % <span class="blue1">2</span>
 == <span class="blue1">0</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST B</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 starString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➌</span>
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 starCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>
 dashString = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>

             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>
<br />
             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (dashString)<br />
     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>

 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>

 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>

 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>

<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>

 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>

 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>

<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>

<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>

    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>

 is.</p>

<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>

<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>

 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>

 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">When your computer sees a <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop, it runs the block of code after the <span class="code">repeat</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➊</span>
 and then checks whether the condition after the <span class="code">while</span>
 keyword <span class="ent">➌</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 . In our example, we start by creating a variable string called <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 . In our <span class="code">repeat</span>
 block, we print our string, and then we cut off the last character. You don’t have to memorize or understand the <span class="code">dropLast()</span>
 method that does this; just know that the code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 removes the last character from our string.</p>
<p class="indent">We are making a shorter string out of our <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 string by taking off the last character and then saving that shorter string in the <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 variable. This updates the value of <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 to the new, shorter string. And in this case, we want to keep removing characters until we have no characters left. So the condition of our <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is to repeat this process as long as the number of characters in <span class="code">shrinking</span>
 is greater than 0. To determine the number of characters in a string, you enter <span class="code">.characters.count</span>
 after the string name. Check out <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig3">Figure 4-3</a>
 to see the incredible shrinking sentence!</p>

</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec4">
<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">for</span>
 count <span class="pink">in</span>

     <span class="pink">if</span>
 count % <span class="blue1">2</span>

         <span class="green">// NEST B</span>

         <span class="pink">for</span>
 starCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>
 ...count {<br />
             <span class="green">// NEST C</span>
<br />
             starString += <span class="red">"*"</span>
<br />
         }<br />
<span class="ent">➍</span>
         <span class="blue">print</span>
 (starString)<br />
<br />
<span class="ent">➎</span>
     } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
         <span class="green">// NEST D</span>
<br />
         <span class="pink">var</span>

         <span class="pink">for</span>
 dashCount <span class="pink">in</span>
 <span class="blue1">1</span>

             <span class="green">// NEST E</span>

             dashString += <span class="red">"-"</span>

         }<br />
         <span class="blue">print</span>

     }<br />
  }</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>

 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>

<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">

<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, because it was declared in the same scope as the <span class="code">print</span>
 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec4">
<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch04lev1sec5"><span id="page_54"></span>
 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>

<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>

<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>

<strong>WHICH LOOP TO USE?</strong>

<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>

<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation.

 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>

<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>

<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>

<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>

 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>

<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>

<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<br />
<span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, so the computer doesn’t know what <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00102.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-6: Trying to access <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside of its scope gives an error.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">To solve this problem, you must declare <span class="code">greeting</span>
 outside the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block. Rewrite the greeting code as follows to output the greeting:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">  <span class="pink">let</span>
 isMorning = <span class="pink">true</span>
<br />
<span class="ent">➊</span>
 <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">""</span>
<br />
<br />
  <span class="pink">if</span>
 <span class="green1">isMorning</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Morning"</span>
<br />
  } <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
      <span class="green1">greeting</span>
 = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
  }<br />
<span class="ent">➋</span>
 <span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">This time, we declared <span class="code">greeting</span>
 as an empty string before the <span class="code">if-else</span>
 block, at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 . Then, we set <span class="code">greeting</span>
 to be either “Good Morning” or “Good Afternoon” depending on whether <span class="code">isMorning</span>
 is <span class="code">true</span>
 or <span class="code">false</span>
 . Finally, we print the greeting at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , after the <span class="code">if-else</span>

 statement.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>
 , we’ll introduce a new kind of variable in Swift—optionals. Optionals are variables that can either have a value or no value at all. They are useful when you need to create a variable, but you don’t yet know its value.<span id="page_58"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, there are several ways to create a loop in your code. It’s up to you, the programmer, to pick the one that’s right for what you need to do. Keep in mind there is often no single right answer because the <span class="code">for-in</span>
 , <span class="code">while</span>
 , and <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loops can do the same thing, depending on how they’re written. You may find that you need a <span class="code">while</span>
 or <span class="code">repeat-while</span>
 loop when you don’t know how many times a loop needs to run, but you can accomplish almost every <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop with a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop. It’s usually best to pick the one that you understand the best.</p>
<p class="indent">It’s also perfectly fine to change your mind later and try a new technique if you think that a different type of loop will work better for a particular situation. The first code you write doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact (even for experienced programmers) it almost never will be! But the point of coding is to practice and problem-solve: write a little code, see how it works, and then go back and make it better.</p>

 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>
<div class="box">

         <span class="blue">print</span>

</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loops</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00101.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="programs">
<span class="pink">let</span>

<span class="pink">if</span>

<br />
} <span class="pink">else</span>
 {<br />
    <span class="pink">var</span>
 greeting = <span class="red">"Good Afternoon"</span>
<br />
}<br />
<span class="blue">print</span>
 (<span class="green1">greeting</span>
 )</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_57"></span>
 When you print <span class="code">greeting</span>
 after this <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement, you get an error, as shown in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig6">Figure 4-6</a>
 . The variable <span class="code">greeting</span>
 is outside the scope of the <span class="code">if-else</span>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>

<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>

 <strong>NESTING AND SCOPE</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">So now you know how to write loops and conditional statements to make choices. You can also combine those elements in just about any way that you want. For example, you can put an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement inside a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop inside an <span class="code">if</span>
 block, or a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop inside another <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop. When you combine loops and conditional statements, there are two important concepts you need to keep in mind: nesting and scope.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec5">
<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>
 . So if you write an <span class="code">if</span>
 statement in a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop, you would call that a <em>nested</em>
 <span class="code">if</span>
 statement. Remember that when we say <em>code block</em>
 , we are referring to the code between opening and closing braces, <span class="code">{}</span>
 . As an example, enter the following code, which outputs a triangle-shaped pattern of asterisks and dashes:</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-4: A nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement with nested <span class="code">for-in</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch04lev2sec6">
<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>

<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to repeat code using loops. You learned that you can use either a <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop or a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop to accomplish many of the same goals. A <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is perfect for looping through a collection of items and doing one thing for each item, and a <span class="code">while</span>
 loop is better suited when you do not know how many times a loop needs to run.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>

<strong>NESTING BLOCKS OF CODE</strong>

<p class="noindent">When you put one code block inside another block, it’s called <em>nesting</em>

 <span class="code">if</span>

<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>
 statement. Nest A contains two nested blocks of code, Nest B and Nest D. And each of those nested blocks of code also contains a nest: Nest C is inside of Nest B, and Nest E is inside of Nest D.</p>

</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>
 increases from 1 to 10. Inside that <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>

<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>

<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>

<p class="indent">Take a look at <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 . We added some color to Xcode to help you see each nested block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">You can nest as many blocks of code as you want. In this example, we’ll refer to each block of code as Nest A, Nest B, Nest C, and so on. As you can see in <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig4">Figure 4-4</a>
 , our program contains an outermost Nest A, which includes all of the code inside the <span class="code">for count in 1...10</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s dig into the code and see what’s going on. At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , there’s an outermost <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, which we call Nest A, that will run 10 times as <span class="code">count</span>

 loop, there’s a nested <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statement at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 that will check whether <span class="code">count</span>
 is even or odd. That <span class="code">if</span>
 statement contains Nest B. To check if a number is even, we use the modulo operator (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>

 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>

 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>

 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>

<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_56"></span>
 <img src="Image00100.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch04fig5"></a>
 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>

<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>

<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>

<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>

 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>

 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>

 ), which tells us what the remainder will be when an integer is divided by another integer. If a number is divided by 2 and the remainder is 0, then it must be an even number. So to figure out if <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we check whether <span class="code">count % 2 == 0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">If <span class="code">count</span>
 is even, we print a string of stars (<span class="code">*</span>
 ). We use <span class="code">count</span>
 to determine how many stars to print. We do this by creating an empty <span class="code">starString</span>
 and then using a nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop, Nest C, at <span class="ent">➌</span>
 to add a star each time <span class="code">starCount</span>
 iterates from 1 to <span class="code">count</span>
 . After the nested <span class="code">for-in</span>
 loop is finished, at <span class="ent">➍</span>
 we print our <span class="code">starString</span>
 , which now has <span class="code">count</span>
 number of stars. We print a nested <span class="code">else</span>
 statement <span class="ent">➎</span>
 , which we’re calling Nest D. When <span class="code">count</span>
 is odd, we print out a string of dashes instead of stars, as instructed in Nest E.</p>

<strong>CONSTANT AND VARIABLE SCOPE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">In programming, a variable has <em>scope</em>
 , which refers to where the variable exists and where it can be used. When you declare a constant or variable inside a nested block of code, that constant or variable does not exist outside that nested block. That means its scope is limited to the block of code in which it was declared and to any nested code in that block. <a href="text00014.html#ch04fig5">Figure 4-5</a>
 shows the scope of the variables of our nested code.</p>

 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>
 clause, Nest D has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>

<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>

<p class="indent">In <a href="text00015.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a>

 <em>Figure 4-5: The scope of a variable or constant is limited to the nest in which it was declared, as well as any code nested in that nest.</em>

<p class="indent">There are five variables declared in our program: <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . The outermost nest, Nest A, can see only <span class="code">count</span>
 . It doesn’t have access to any variables or constants inside its nested blocks of code, which means you can’t use variables or constants that are declared in Nests B or C. The variable <span class="code">starString</span>
 is declared in Nest B. Nest B therefore has access to <span class="code">starString</span>
 as well as anything created in Nest A, which includes <span class="code">count</span>
 . Nest C has access to <span class="code">starCount</span>
 , <span class="code">starString</span>
 , and <span class="code">count</span>
 . Similarly, in the <span class="code">else</span>

 and <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and Nest E has access to <span class="code">count</span>
 , <span class="code">dashString</span>
 , and <span class="code">dashCount</span>
 . If you try to use a variable that a block of code can’t access because it’s outside its scope, you’ll get an error. For example, you can’t print <span class="code">dashString</span>
 inside the outermost nest, Nest A.</p>

<p class="indent">Let’s take a look at another example. We’ll write code that creates a greeting. If it is morning, we want the greeting to be “Good Morning.” Otherwise, we want the greeting to be “Good Afternoon.” Enter the following code into your playground:</p>

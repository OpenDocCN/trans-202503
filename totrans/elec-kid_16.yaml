    electronics. Use this as a reference when, for example, you need to figure out
    what the color bands of a specific resistor mean. I’ve also listed some websites
    where you can continue learning and find more projects to build.

    to read those components as there are component types. Here are some handy cheat
    sheets to help you read resistors and capacitors and to help you remember what
    the different prefixes on units like volts and amperes mean.

- en: Most of the resistors in this book have four color bands. To determine a resistor’s
    value, just look up its colors in the following diagram and multiply accordingly.
    For example, to get 470 Ω, you’d multiply the number 47 (given by the yellow and
    purple bands) by 10 (given by the brown band). For more details on resistors,
    see “[Meet the Resistor](ch04.xhtml#ch04lev1sec01)” on [page 70](ch04.xhtml#page_70).

    this table when you’re using ceramic or tantalum capacitors because, unlike the
    electrolytic capacitors used in much of this book, those won’t have their capacitance
    written straight out for you.

    47, and add the number of zeros specified by the third digit, 3\. That gives you
    47,000 pF, which is 47 nF, or 0.047 µF.

- en: When building electronics projects, as in many areas of science, we sometimes
    have to deal with really small or really big numbers. Fortunately, there’s a set
    of standard prefixes in the International System of Units to make those numbers
    easier to write. The prefixes are multipliers, as shown in the table.

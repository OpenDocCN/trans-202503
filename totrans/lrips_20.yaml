- en: The mandelbroccoli bushes got shorter and wilder until they blended in with
    the forest. Laurie didn’t know where she was or where she was going. But she knew
    how to get there. At least, she hoped she did. By now it was late afternoon and
    the shadows were getting longer.

  zh: 曼德尔布罗利灌木越来越矮小和杂乱，直到它们与森林融为一体。劳里不知道自己在哪里，也不知道要去哪里。但她知道怎么走过去。至少，她希望自己知道。现在已经是下午晚些时候，影子越来越长了。
- en: The trees of the forest were large oaks and maple, with an occasional pine or
    spruce. There were a number of saplings and bushes of various sorts. It was hard
    to see far because of all the leaves, but walking was easy enough if she skirted
    the spruce and berry bushes.

  zh: 森林中的树木是高大的橡树和枫树，偶尔会看到一棵松树或云杉。还有一些不同种类的幼树和灌木丛。由于树叶繁茂，很难看得远，但如果她绕开云杉和浆果灌木，走路倒是挺容易的。

- en: No running this time. She walked toward the noise as quietly as she could. It
    seemed to be behind a large tree. No, not a Jargon. It was . . . a squirrel. An
    ordinary squirrel. It yelled what were probably very nasty things in Squirrel,
    then ran up the tree to safety. And that tree! She recognized it. It was the big
    tree behind her house, at the edge of the woods . . .

  zh: 这次不跑了。她尽量悄悄地朝声音的方向走去。声音似乎来自一棵大树后面。不，这不是一种“行话”。那是……一只松鼠。一只普通的松鼠。它用松鼠语喊了一些可能非常恶毒的话，然后爬上了树，逃到了安全的地方。那棵树！她认得那棵树。那是她家后面的那棵大树，位于森林的边缘……

- en: Lying in her own bed after a hot bath made Laurie feel happy and tired. As far
    as her mother knew, Laurie had been gone only an hour or two. To Laurie, though,
    it felt like at least a week since she’d gotten lost in the woods. She was too
    sleepy to think about it. She hoped Xor had gotten his wish and was learning how
    to blend in. She was sad that she didn’t get to see her new friends again. She
    had promised to come back . . . after delivering . . . delivering that letter
    . . .

  zh: 在热水澡后躺在自己床上的劳里感到又高兴又疲倦。就她妈妈知道的情况，劳里只离开了一两个小时。然而，劳里觉得自从迷失在森林中已经过了至少一周。她太困了，没心思再去想这些了。她希望Xor已经达成了自己的愿望，学会了如何融入。她感到难过，因为没能再次见到她的新朋友们。她曾答应过回来……在交完……交那封信之后……

- en: She read it twice before she noticed that Winsome’s last name was Trapp. It
    made sense. For all of the sour things Winsome had said about Colonel Trapp, they
    were a lot alike, sending strange messages and bossing people around. It looked
    like Laurie wasn’t the only one who had trouble getting along with her parents.

  zh: 她读了两遍，才注意到温索姆的姓是特拉普。这样也能解释得通。尽管温索姆对特拉普上校说了许多酸溜溜的话，但他们很像，两人都在发出奇怪的信息并指挥别人。看起来劳里并不是唯一一个和父母相处困难的人。
- en: She lay down again and thought about tomorrow. Tomorrow was the first day of
    summer school. It didn’t sound as scary as it did before. If she could navigate
    the Byzantine Process, beat Ponens and Tollens, make infinite strings, and teach
    turtles to build towers, sitting in a classroom didn’t sound that hard at all.

  zh: 她再次躺下，思考着明天。明天是暑期学校的第一天。现在听起来并不像以前那么可怕了。如果她能应付复杂的流程，击败庞恩斯和托伦斯，制造无限的字符串，并教海龟建造塔楼，那坐在课堂上就不再那么难了。

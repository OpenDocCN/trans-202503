- en: The mandelbroccoli bushes got shorter and wilder until they blended in with
    the forest. Laurie didn’t know where she was or where she was going. But she knew
    how to get there. At least, she hoped she did. By now it was late afternoon and
    the shadows were getting longer.

- en: The trees of the forest were large oaks and maple, with an occasional pine or
    spruce. There were a number of saplings and bushes of various sorts. It was hard
    to see far because of all the leaves, but walking was easy enough if she skirted
    the spruce and berry bushes.

    seemed to be behind a large tree. No, not a Jargon. It was . . . a squirrel. An
    ordinary squirrel. It yelled what were probably very nasty things in Squirrel,
    then ran up the tree to safety. And that tree! She recognized it. It was the big
    tree behind her house, at the edge of the woods . . .

- en: Lying in her own bed after a hot bath made Laurie feel happy and tired. As far
    as her mother knew, Laurie had been gone only an hour or two. To Laurie, though,
    it felt like at least a week since she’d gotten lost in the woods. She was too
    sleepy to think about it. She hoped Xor had gotten his wish and was learning how
    to blend in. She was sad that she didn’t get to see her new friends again. She
    had promised to come back . . . after delivering . . . delivering that letter
    . . .

- en: She read it twice before she noticed that Winsome’s last name was Trapp. It
    made sense. For all of the sour things Winsome had said about Colonel Trapp, they
    were a lot alike, sending strange messages and bossing people around. It looked
    like Laurie wasn’t the only one who had trouble getting along with her parents.

    summer school. It didn’t sound as scary as it did before. If she could navigate
    the Byzantine Process, beat Ponens and Tollens, make infinite strings, and teach
    turtles to build towers, sitting in a classroom didn’t sound that hard at all.

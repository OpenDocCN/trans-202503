- en: Apple’s macOS—Darwin—has evolved considerably in the past two decades. From
    a relatively niche operating system trailing way behind Microsoft’s Windows, macOS
    has slowly but surely gained acceptance. People all over the world started realizing
    its powerful capabilities, coupled with the Mac’s superior hardware and integration
    into the Apple ecosystem, spearheaded by the iPhone.

    the “Mac versus PC” ads, showing the PC as a sniffling, virus-infected system,
    while the Mac chuckles them away. Viruses, spyware, ransomware, and other malware
    have dramatically exploded, and by now it seems that every week some new variant
    emerges. Malware authors found the Mac to be a ripe breeding ground for exploitation
    and proliferation.

    its own frameworks (XProtect and, more recently, Endpoint Security) and YARA antivirus
    signatures, there was still a gaping void when it came to intrusion detection
    and Mac malware detection and prevention tools.

- en: Into this chasm stepped Patrick. “That macOS Malware guy” started churning out
    a cornucopia of free and effective security and analytics tools, through the Objective-See
    website. By now, Pat’s GitHub repository sports some two dozen tools, which have
    managed to level the playing field a little, giving power users the ability to
    monitor what goes on inside their Mac, detecting (and hopefully preventing) compromises.

    This is where this book fills another lacuna—explicating the ins and outs of Malware
    in a much-needed book. From the basics through infection vectors to the various
    analysis methods and techniques, Patrick elucidates Mac malware, drawing on the
    (unfortunately) many real-life examples.

    vanquish. Not so in ours. Thus, research into how they work, and how to prevent
    them—whether proactively and reactively, or a combination of techniques—is paramount.

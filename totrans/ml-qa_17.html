<div class="image1"><img src="../images/common.jpg" alt="Image" width="252" height="252"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">What is the distributional hypothesis in natural language processing (NLP)? Where is it used, and how far does it hold true?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The distributional hypothesis is a linguistic theory suggesting that words occurring in the same contexts tend to have similar meanings, according to the original source, “Distributional Structure” by Zellig S. Harris. Succinctly, the more similar the meanings of two words are, the more often they appear in similar contexts.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Consider the sentence in <a href="ch14.xhtml#ch14fig1">Figure 14-1</a>, for example. The words <em>cats</em> and <em>dogs</em> often occur in similar contexts, and we could replace <em>cats</em> with <em>dogs</em> without making the sentence sound awkward. We could also replace <em>cats</em> with <em>hamsters</em>, since both are mammals and pets, and the sentence would still sound plausible. However, replacing <em>cats</em> with an unrelated word such as <em>sandwiches</em> would render the sentence clearly wrong, and replacing <em>cats</em> with the unrelated word <em>driving</em> would also make the sentence grammatically incorrect.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_90"/>It is easy to construct counterexamples using polysemous words, that is, words that have multiple meanings that are related but not identical. For example, consider the word <em>bank</em>. As a noun, it can refer to a financial institution, the “rising ground bordering a river,” the “steep incline of a hill,” or a “protective cushioning rim” (according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary). It can even be a verb: to bank on something means to rely or depend on it. These different meanings have different distributional properties and may not always occur in similar contexts.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Nonetheless, the distributional hypothesis is quite useful. Word embeddings (introduced in <a href="ch01.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>) such as Word2vec, as well as many large language transformer models, rely on this idea. This includes the masked language model in BERT and the next-word pretraining task used in GPT.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev66"><strong>Word2vec, BERT, and GPT</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The Word2vec approach uses a simple, two-layer neural network to encode words into embedding vectors such that the embedding vectors of similar words are both semantically and syntactically close. There are two ways to train a Word2vec model: the continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) approach and the skip-gram approach. When using CBOW, the Word2vec model learns to predict the current words by using the surrounding context words. Conversely, in the skip-gram model, Word2vec predicts the context words from a selected word. While skip-gram is more effective for infrequent words, CBOW is usually faster to train.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">After training, word embeddings are placed within the vector space so that words with common contexts in the corpus—that is, words with semantic and syntactic similarities—are positioned close to each other, as illustrated in <a href="ch14.xhtml#ch14fig2">Figure 14-2</a>. Conversely, dissimilar words are located farther apart in the embedding space.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_91"/>BERT is an LLM based on the transformer architecture (see <a href="ch08.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>) that uses a masked language modeling approach that involves masking (hiding) some of the words in a sentence. Its task is to predict these masked words based on the other words in the sequence, as illustrated in <a href="ch14.xhtml#ch14fig3">Figure 14-3</a>. This is a form of the self-supervised learning used to pretrain LLMs (see <a href="ch02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> for more on self-supervised learning). The pretrained model produces embeddings in which similar words (or tokens) are close in the embedding space.</p>&#13;

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 14-3: BERT’s pretraining task involves predicting randomly masked words.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">GPT, which like BERT is also an LLM based on the transformer architecture, functions as a decoder. Decoder-style models like GPT learn to predict subsequent words in a sequence based on the preceding ones, as illustrated in <a href="ch14.xhtml#ch14fig4">Figure 14-4</a>. GPT contrasts with BERT, an encoder model, as it emphasizes predicting what follows rather than encoding the entire sequence simultaneously.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">Where BERT is a bidirectional language model that considers the whole input sequence, GPT only strictly parses previous sequence elements. This means BERT is usually better suited for classification tasks, whereas GPT is more suited for text generation tasks. Similar to BERT, GPT produces high-quality contextualized word embeddings that capture semantic similarity.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_92"/></p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev67"><strong>Does the Hypothesis Hold?</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">For large datasets, the distributional hypothesis more or less holds true, making it quite useful for understanding and modeling language patterns, word relationships, and semantic meanings. For example, this concept enables techniques like word embedding and semantic analysis, which, in turn, facilitate natural language processing tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and machine translation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In conclusion, while there are counterexamples in which the distributional hypothesis does not hold, it is a very useful concept that forms the cornerstone of modern language transformer models.</p>&#13;

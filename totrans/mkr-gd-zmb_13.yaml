    belongs near the top of the list. The devices in this book will help you stay
    alive, and to build them, you’ll often need to join insulated wires together or
    fit them into a screw terminal. The first step in that process is exposing the
    bare wire.

    insulation with a sharp pair of wire cutters (also called snips). [Figure B-1](app02.html#app02fig1)

    is long, you could wrap it around your fingers instead. Either way, the idea is
    to stop the wire from moving. Next, gently pinch the wire with the cutters at
    the position where you want to remove the insulation. Apply just enough pressure
    to almost cut through the insulation without cutting into the wire inside, then
    pull the insulation away ([Figure B-1b](app02.html#app02fig1)). If the snips start
    to slip as you pull, just squeeze them a bit tighter.

    Wires](app02.html#ch00lev1sec225)” on [page 227](app02.html#page_227)). Then,
    if your wire is stranded rather than solid, use your thumb and forefinger to twist
    each wire on its own and keep all the strands together ([Figure B-2a](app02.html#app02fig2)).
    Next, place the two wires side by side, lining up the ends of the insulation,
    and twist the wires around each other ([Figure B-2b](app02.html#app02fig2)). Try
    to make sure that the wires actually go around each other, rather than leaving
    one wire straight while the other wraps around it. This can be difficult if the

- en: Most multimeters have a Continuity or Buzzer mode, selectable from the range
    knob. When the multimeter is set to continuity, a buzzer on the multimeter sounds
    if the two test leads are touched together. The buzzer should also sound when
    the leads are connected by something with low resistance, like a wire, PCB track,
    or dubious solder joint.

- en: This function may not sound very useful, but it is actually invaluable. It allows
    you to test fuses as well as suspect wires that look okay but may have a break
    beneath the insulation. It is also good for testing switches. Just touch the leads
    the switch contacts, and if the multimeter buzzes when you flip the switch, then
    all is well. Similarly, to test a fuse, first touch the test leads together to
    hear the beep and make sure the multimeter is working and then touch the leads
    to either end of the fuse. If the meter doesn’t work, then the fuse has blown.

    it swings both positive and negative, making its average value zero, so the meter
    will convert the AC to DC internally before giving a reading if one of these ranges

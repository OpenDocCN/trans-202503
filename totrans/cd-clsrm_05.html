<h1 class="ChapterTitle"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Diving into Web Development</h1>&#13;
</header>&#13;
<p class="ChapterIntroFirst">In this chapter, we’ll learn about a development environment built into every web browser that students can jump right into and use to begin executing code within moments. This tool requires no development environment setup and no need to install new software, and will deeply engage students with software code using a single keystroke. Just like when learning a foreign language, the quickest way to learn code is to immerse ourselves in it.</p>&#13;
<h2 class="HeadA"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Developing in the Web Browser </h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">We’ll jump right into web development. To get the most from this chapter, it’s best to follow along with the steps provided. These are the same steps your students will follow in class over several lessons. As you move through the steps, think about how you might tailor the content to your students’ specific needs.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">For simplicity, this book uses the Google Chrome browser running on the Windows operating system. But every web browser now has <em class="EmphasisItalic">web development tools</em> that are very similar to one another, and the steps outlined here should be available in other browsers and operating systems. The only potential roadblock you might encounter is your organization’s computer policies. If you’re using a school computer, access to the web development tools might be disabled as a group policy, but personal computers will allow you to access them. Work with your organization’s technical support department to access these valuable tools if they’re blocked within your organization.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Open your web browser and navigate to any web page. This book uses Wikipedia, but any site should work. Press <strong class="EmphasisBold">F12</strong>. A new window opens, which looks similar to Figure 5-1. In this screenshot, the tools are docked to the browser for illustrative purposes, but making them free-floating is often a more convenient option.</p>&#13;
<figure>&#13;
<p class="AnchoredGraphic"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-1" src="image/CitC05_01_WebDevelopmentTools_labeled_new.png"/></p>&#13;
<figcaption class="Caption">Figure 5-1: Web development tools</figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="Body">Figure 5-1 shows four main areas. At the top of the figure is the browser window <span class="Wingdings">❶</span>, which is the web page we’re analyzing. Below the browser window are the <em class="EmphasisItalic">elements</em> of the page <span class="Wingdings">❷</span>, the markup language from which the page is rendered—a type of source code. The elements currently selected have various properties <span class="Wingdings">❸</span>. At the bottom of the figure is the <em class="EmphasisItalic">console</em> <span class="Wingdings">❹</span>, which displays information useful to the web developer. </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Before going any further, take a few moments to have students reflect on what they think about this interface. Ask them how they feel when confronted with this screen. Do they feel frustrated? Intimidated? Excited? How would they learn about this software on their own? Would they click around and play with it? Is there built-in help? If so, how does that feature compare to search engine results about it? Have students examine their thinking at this time and document it in a few sentences so they can empathize with the users who will one day be confronted with software the students might create.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">In a sense, you’ve just thrown your students into a pool’s deep end. As mentioned earlier, these complex panels are known as web development tools, and they’re the same tools software engineers use when writing and debugging web applications. With these tools, your students are accessing the client-side code that makes up the web page. Work with them to analyze it, step through it, and even manipulate it.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">These powerful tools are built into every web browser, and as intimidating as they appear, whatever your students do will be completely safe. Students will only be experimenting with the code on their local computers. They’ll have the freedom to click around, explore different menu options, and try to break features as much as they like. Just as board games provide a magic circle for experimenting with ideas, web development tools provide a safe space for experimenting with code. Give your students some time to just explore and play with this browser feature on their own before moving on to more directed content. So many wow factors exist in these tools. Allowing students the excitement of self-discovery and time to share with their peers can improve their engagement going forward. It’s also exciting for the teacher to see their students leaning forward into the content on their own.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="HeadB"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>Document Object Model Inspector</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Once your students have explored the interface and learned about it on their own, provide a more formal lesson on how to use the web development tools. Specifically, they will learn about the <em class="EmphasisItalic">Document Object Model (DOM)</em> for web pages, which is the hierarchy of elements with which they may interact. To facilitate this, we will introduce them to the <em class="EmphasisItalic">DOM Inspector</em> within the web development tools, which will allow them to navigate and manipulate these elements.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">We’ll begin by launching the DOM Inspector. If necessary, undock this suite of tools and move the window over to one side of the desktop and the browser to the other side so you can see both windows at once. In the elements panel, move your mouse over the <em class="EmphasisItalic">hypertext markup language (HTML)</em>, which describes the web page’s structure. HTML is composed of <em class="EmphasisItalic">tags</em> that define a web document’s elements. Each element on a page has an opening and closing tag. For example, in the markup <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</span> , the <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">&lt;p&gt;</span> is the opening paragraph tag, the <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">&lt;/p&gt;</span> is the closing tag, and <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">This is a ­paragraph.</span> is the inner HTML content of the element. Many different tags define elements in a web page, including <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">&lt;video&gt;&lt;/video&gt;</span>, <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</span>, and <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">&lt;table&gt;&lt;/table</span>, to name a few.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Parts of the web page will become highlighted as you move the mouse up and down the HTML. What you’re seeing is which HTML elements refer to which objects on the web page. For example, hovering the mouse over an <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">h1</span> tag will usually highlight the title of the page. Alternatively, if you right-click a specific part of the page in the browser window, a pop-up menu will appear. Select <strong class="EmphasisBold">Inspect</strong> or <strong class="EmphasisBold">Inspect Element</strong> from the menu and the web development tools will highlight the part of the source code referring to that part of the page.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">The DOM consists of many nested nodes organized hierarchically in a tree structure. In the elements panel, you can click the arrows to the left of nodes to expand them and see their contents or collapse them for a simpler view. Figure 5-2 provides a high-level view of this document hierarchy.</p>&#13;
<figure>&#13;
<p class="AnchoredGraphic"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-2" src="image/CitC05_02_DOMheirarchy_new.png"/></p>&#13;
<figcaption class="Caption">Figure 5-2: DOM hierarchy</figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="Body">All web pages use this organizational structure. Starting with the root <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">&lt;html&gt;</span> node, the document branches into the <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">&lt;head&gt;</span> node where the document properties like title, search terms, and programming code reside. The document also branches into the <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">&lt;body&gt;</span> node where the web page content like text, images, and videos resides. Show your students the tree structure in Figure 5-2. Then show them the sample markup in Listing 5-1 to see how the tree looks in an actual script.</p>&#13;
<pre>&lt;html&gt;&#13;
  &lt;head&gt;&#13;
    &lt;title&gt;Hello, World Website&lt;/title&gt;&#13;
  &lt;/head&gt;&#13;
  &lt;body&gt;&#13;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
  &lt;/body&gt;&#13;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>&#13;
<p class="Listing">Listing 5-1: Basic HTML structure</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">In this very elementary example, the script is indented deeper for each level the tree descends. Have your students explore how elements are nested in various websites to find and become familiar with these basic DOM elements. Understanding the DOM as a tree structure can provide your students with a map for navigating the HTML and will be especially useful when they’re writing code that manipulates it.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">But the real wow factor is the DOM Inspector. Try inspecting the headline of the Wikipedia article and then double-click the text in the elements panel. It should become editable (if not, try right-clicking the text and selecting <strong class="EmphasisBold">Edit</strong> or <strong class="EmphasisBold">Edit as HTML</strong> from the options). Make some changes to the text and then look at your browser to see your handiwork. In Figure 5-3, the Wikipedia article’s <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">h1</span> tag is edited to a mnemonic for remembering biological taxonomies. You can see the edit in the elements panel and the result in the browser window. </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">This is a playful <em class="EmphasisItalic">hack</em>—a clever technical trick that should impress your students. You haven’t edited the actual website on the server, only its presentation in your client browser. If you want to see the web page as it still appears to everyone else on the web, simply refresh the page to wipe away your changes.</p>&#13;

<section class="feature1">&#13;
<h2 class="BoxHead">Your Own Wikipedia Page</h2>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">When you introduce students to DOM manipulation through the browser’s web development tools, many students will become deeply engaged, leaning forward and hacking at the code on their screens using this new toy. With a few introductory minutes of walking them through some brief code modifications, you can easily let them spend another hour hacking at an existing web page to quickly craft something personal. Provide them with a constructive exercise in which they can craft their own Wikipedia entry.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">Before you begin, warn students that these changes aren’t permanent. If they refresh or leave the web page, they’ll lose all their work. Caution them not to press F5, the browser refresh button, or to click any link on the page as they work. If they do, they’ll lose all the changes.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">Fortunately, as students will find, it’s not hard to recoup any work they lose. Have them edit the title of a Wikipedia page to their own name. Then have them write text about themselves in Notepad or another text editor so they can copy and paste it over the article text. Can any of the students figure out how to change the images on the page to other images that interest them?</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">The most rewarding part of this exercise is watching as students take the exercise beyond the introductory code changes you show them. It’s immensely satisfying when a student starts hacking into a web page’s styles, moving elements around, swapping out images, and tweaking the code. They’re like scientists exploring this environment of logic and syntax, and learning through experimentation.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">When a student discovers a new skill, like how to replace an image on the web page, have them share their discovery with the rest of the class. Challenge your students. Ask if anyone can figure out how to change the background or text color on the page. How would they learn to do that? Through further tinkering or by searching the web? Have students recognize how they best learn new skills.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyLast">At the end of this exercise, each student will have a product they can print or save as a PDF and share with family and friends. More important, they’ll know that they can launch this new tool from any computer, at home, school, or the local library, and review the code that makes up any website.</p>&#13;
<div class="bottom hr"><hr/></div>&#13;
</section>&#13;
</aside><p class="Body">Now look at the properties panel where the current tab should read <strong class="EmphasisBold">Styles</strong>. This panel displays the <em class="EmphasisItalic">Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)</em> definitions for whatever you’ve selected in the elements panel. CSS describes how elements in the DOM should appear, using attributes such as <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">font-family</span>, <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">font-size</span>, <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">color</span>, <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">alignment</span>, and so forth.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">As with the elements panel, you can edit these CSS definitions and see how the edits affect the page’s appearance. For example, when you scroll through the many definitions in the Styles tab, you’ll likely find one labeled <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">background-color</span> followed by a value like <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">#000000</span>, <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">black</span>, or <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">rgb(0,0,0)</span>. Change that value to something else, such as <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">red</span>, <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">blue</span>, or even <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">lemonchiffon</span>. The DOM Inspector will give you suggestions, as shown in Figure 5-4.</p>&#13;
<figure>&#13;
<p class="AnchoredGraphic"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-4" src="image/CitC05_04_ColorSugesstions.png"/></p>&#13;
<figcaption class="Caption">Figure 5-4: Suggested valid color values in the Styles tab</figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="Body">If there is no <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">background-color</span> attribute, you can scroll down to travel up the node hierarchy until you find the <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">html, body</span> definition.  Like the color suggestions, the DOM Inspector will also give you attribute suggestions so you can add a new background definition. Tinker with the styles on a few pages to become familiar with some of the many available styling options.</p>&#13;
<aside epub:type="sidebar">&#13;
<div class="top hr"><hr/></div>&#13;
<section class="feature1">&#13;
<h2 class="BoxHead">Ways of Representing Colors</h2>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Colors are defined in a variety of formats in CSS. For an enlightening exercise in different ways of representing the same data, have your students try the following formats on the background color and font color of a web page style sheet.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxListPlainA"><strong class="EmphasisBoldBox">Red-Green-Blue (RGB)</strong> Written as <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">rgb(0,0,0)</span>, this format defines the levels of red, green, and blue in a color using numbers between 0 and 255. In this format, <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">rgb(255, 0, 0)</span> is red, <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">rgb(0,255,0)</span> is green, and <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">rgb(0,0,255)</span> is blue.  Mixing different amounts of these three colors will produce all the colors in the visible spectrum.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxListPlainB"><strong class="EmphasisBoldBox">Hexadecimal</strong> This most common format uses numbers in base-16 to define RGB levels. Just as in base-2/binary format, numbers flip to 0 after 1 as in [0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 111 . . .], but base-16 numbers flip to 0 after 15. So instead of [9, 10, 11, 12 . . .], a hexadecimal sequence looks like this: [9, A, B, C, D, E, F, 10, 11, 12  . . . 1E, 1F, 20, 21 . . .]. A hexadecimal color value of <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">#FFFFFF</span> translates to 255 red, 255 green, and 255 blue to produce white, and <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">#000000</span> is 0 red, 0 green, and 0 blue, which produces black. Similarly, <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">#FF0000</span> is red, <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">#00FF00</span> is green, and <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">#0000FF</span> is blue.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxListPlainB"><strong class="EmphasisBoldBox">Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Black (CMYK)</strong> The CMYK format is like RGB but uses percentages, such as <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">cmyk(100%,0%,0%,0%)</span> to define 100 percent cyan and 0 magenta, yellow, and black. CMYK is rarely used but is favored by some developers for its application in print design.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxListPlainB"><strong class="EmphasisBoldBox">Hue-Saturation-Lightness (HSL)</strong> Similar to RGB and CMYK, HSL defines degrees and shades on a color wheel. Hue defines the color, such as 120 for green, 240 for blue, and 0 or 360 for red. Saturation and lightness define the amount of color and shading. Examples would be <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">hsl(120, 100%, 50%)</span>, which produces green, and <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">hsl(0, 100%, 50%)</span>, which produces red.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxListPlainC"><strong class="EmphasisBoldBox">Name</strong> The most accessible color format is also the least precise. There are a wide variety of official names for colors in CSS, including <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">red</span>, <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">green</span>, <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">blue</span>, <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">eden</span>, <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">rhino</span>, <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">chambray</span>, and <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">calypso</span>, to name a few. Each of these names matches a range of colors in the other, more precise formats. </p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyLast">A fun game you can play in class with these values is to have students match values across formats. For example, set the <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">background-color</span> of a web page to a color in CMYK. Then ask students to make the text blend into the background by defining the <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">color</span> attribute, which defines the font color, to match it in RGB or hexadecimal.</p>&#13;
<div class="bottom hr"><hr/></div>&#13;
</section>&#13;
</aside><p class="Body">The elements panel displays the web page’s DOM: the document’s content in HTML. The CSS on the Styles tab defines how that content is laid out and appears. The content and styling are separated or <em class="EmphasisItalic">decoupled</em>. Decoupling the style from the content makes the content easier for developers to maintain and easier for machines, such as search engine web crawlers, to read. Once you and your students feel comfortable with the DOM’s content and design aspects, you can move on to programming code to begin manipulating the DOM in more dynamic ways.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="HeadB"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>The Console</h3>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">Although playing with the DOM Inspector is fun for learning about and manipulating websites, you’re only minimally engaging with programming concepts and computational thinking. HTML and CSS aren’t programming languages. They’re <em class="EmphasisItalic">markup languages</em>, syntax that defines and structures data that the browser reads and translates into a website. But we need to understand the structure and rules of this medium before we can start manipulating it with programming code.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Let’s look at the web development tools in the <em class="EmphasisItalic">console</em>. This area of the tool is where the browser will report errors and information about the web page. It might report errors in the website code or inform the developer that a feature referenced in the web page script is being phased out, or <em class="EmphasisItalic">deprecated</em>, in a future release.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">The console also provides instant access to a simple coding environment. Here we can run simple lines of code with inputs and see their outputs. Web developers use this feature to check the values of variables or other states as they run in the page.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">In your console, enter the highly cryptic code in Listing 5-2 and press <span class="Keycap">enter</span> to execute it.</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt;<span class="LiteralBold _idGenCharOverride-1"> for(i=0;++i&lt;101;console.log(i%5?f||i:f+'Buzz'))f=i%3?'':'Fizz'</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="Listing">Listing 5-2: A JavaScript one-liner for the <span class="EmphasisRevItal">FizzBuzz</span> game</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">This is very dense code, but if you entered it correctly, the console should output the numbers 1 through 100, replacing each number divisible by three with “Fizz,” numbers divisible by five with “Buzz,” and numbers divisible by three and five with “FizzBuzz.” This models the classic classroom game <strong class="EmphasisBoldItalic">FizzBuzz</strong> in which students sit in a circle and count upward, replacing numbers divisible by three and five with the words “Fizz” and “Buzz” respectively.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Programming <em class="EmphasisItalic">FizzBuzz</em> from scratch is also a common interview question. The example in Listing 5-2 uses multiple syntax tricks to condense the program into a single line to impress interviewers, and we use it for ease of execution in the web console, but the code is unreadable as a result. Other programmers who encounter this code would have a hard time deciphering what it does. Listing 5-3 shows what this code might look like in a more readable format.</p>&#13;
<pre>for(i = 0; i &lt; 101; ++i) {&#13;
  var out = i + ' ';&#13;
  if (i%3 == 0) out += 'Fizz';&#13;
  if (i%5 == 0) out += 'Buzz';&#13;
  console.log(out);&#13;
}</pre>&#13;
<p class="Listing">Listing 5-3: <span class="EmphasisRevItal">FizzBuzz</span> in a more human-friendly format</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">To execute the code in Listing 5-3, first type it into a text editor, like Notepad or TextEdit, and then copy and paste it into the console. By doing so, you can save your code snippets to a text file where you can modify and extend them later. Using this technique, you can also execute the code samples provided in Chapter 4, such as the <em class="EmphasisItalic">Snakes and Ladders</em> example.</p>&#13;
<aside epub:type="sidebar">&#13;
<div class="top hr"><hr/></div>&#13;
<section class="feature1">&#13;
<h2 class="BoxHead">Web Development Tools and Cybersecurity</h2>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">The web development tools and the console are safe spaces for students to experiment, but there are some caveats. If you navigate to Facebook in your browser and launch the web development tools, the message in Figure 5-5 appears in the console.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">The Facebook web application is programmed to issue this warning to alert users that criminals may use it to access their sensitive personal data. It’s important for your students to know that they should never access the web development tools when asked by a stranger. Although websites strive for optimal security, criminals can find exploits to leak sensitive user data through various methods. Students should be suspicious of anyone who asks them to use these tools on any website they use that requires a login.</p>&#13;
<figure><p class="AnchoredBoxGraphic"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-5" src="image/CitC05_05_FacebookWarning.png"/></p>&#13;
<figcaption class="CaptionBox">Figure 5-5: Facebook console warning</figcaption></figure>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">Once they’re familiar with the DOM Inspector, students can see how applications like browser plug-ins, which are extensions provided by third parties to offer additional functionality, work to understand potential exploits. For example, some plug-ins operate by injecting JavaScript code into each web page or by manipulating the DOM. Figure 5-5 shows two <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT</span> errors, which are from an AdBlock plug-in in the browser blocking content it identified as advertisements.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">Similarly, students should understand the concept of <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">ethical hacking</em>. That is, they should feel free to tinker with and explore any website’s code. But they need to know that if they find an exploit, such as a means to circumvent a site’s authentication or corrupt its data, they have a responsibility to privately report it to the website owner so an administrator can fix the vulnerability.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">Ethical use of the web development tools also applies to their propensity for mischief. Editing a Wikipedia page as a fun learning exercise is a harmless activity, but consider the implications shown in Figure 5-6.</p>&#13;
<figure>&#13;
<p class="AnchoredBoxGraphic"><img alt="" class="_idGenObjectAttribute-6" src="image/CitC05_06_AbeLincolnQuote.png"/></p>&#13;
<figcaption class="CaptionBox">Figure 5-6: Abe Lincoln on Twitter</figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyLast">This meme stresses why we should approach everything digital with healthy skepticism. It’s a harmless joke, but using the same technique to edit a tweet by another student as a means of spreading misinformation or to hurt someone’s reputation is unethical. Web development tools are very powerful, but as Uncle Ben told Peter Parker, “With great power comes great responsibility.”</p>&#13;
<div class="bottom hr"><hr/></div>&#13;
</section>&#13;
</aside>&#13;
<p class="Body">With the console, students can instantly begin experimenting with a core programming language in web development. JavaScript is a safe language, which means working with JavaScript in the web development tools is entirely done on the client side. Client-side code executes in the browser, not the server hosting the JavaScript code. Running in the client browser, JavaScript can’t execute any malicious operations. It can’t write or erase files, or otherwise harm the client.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Being a primarily client-side programming language, JavaScript has many functions that relate to the DOM and allow you to reference nodes in the DOM’s tree structure. When students know that the <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">document</span> root node branches off into the head and body nodes, they can reference these nodes in JavaScript by using <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">document.head</span> and <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">document.body</span>. From either of these nodes, they can reference nodes and properties further down the chain. For example, try executing the code in Listing 5-3. The <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">innerHTML</span> portion references the content between the two <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">&lt;body&gt;</span> tags:</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; <span class="LiteralBold _idGenCharOverride-1">document.body.innerHTML = 'Hello, World!';</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="Listing">Listing 5-3: A line of code that replaces a web page</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">When you press <span class="Keycap">enter</span> after entering this line of code to execute it, the entire web page you’re viewing vanishes. In its place, students will simply see the words “Hello, World!” You might get some surprised reactions when your students see what they too can do. </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">With JavaScript code, you can modify the content of the page programmatically. Listing 5-4 provides another example. The <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">document.body.style</span> portion allows you to modify the body node’s CSS properties. This line of code changes the body background color to blue if you execute it in the console:</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; <span class="LiteralBold _idGenCharOverride-1">document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="Listing">Listing 5-4: A line of code that changes the body background color</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Notice the capitalization that Listing 5-3 and Listing 5-4 use. Specifically, note that <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">innerHTML</span> and <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">backgroundColor</span> are defined in <em class="EmphasisItalic">camel-case capitalization</em>: the first letter of each word is capitalized so the variable name has humps like a camel’s back. JavaScript is a case-sensitive language, so it will treat a variable named <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">camelCase</span> and a variable named <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">CamelCase</span> as two different variables. Capitalization is important, so if your code isn’t working, check to make sure you have this right.</p>&#13;

<h2 class="BoxHead">JavaScript as an Educational Tool</h2>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Currently, a multitude of programming languages and development environments are available to programmers. So many that it’s becoming increasingly difficult to decide which technology to choose for a project. This is especially true in education where block-based languages like <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">Scratch</em> turn programming into a video game, easily readable languages like <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">Python </em>make coding more accessible, and highly robust languages like <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">Java</em> introduce students to more advanced programming concepts.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">In contrast, JavaScript doesn’t appear as much in educational settings. When you look online, you’ll find many academics and programmers complaining about JavaScript as a programming language for a variety of erudite reasons. Despite the criticisms, JavaScript is the most widely used programming language in the world; anyone who wants to share their applications on the web needs to know how to use it to code.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">Here are some reasons to use JavaScript in the classroom:</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxListPlainA"><strong class="EmphasisBoldBox">Ability to start coding instantly</strong> Every programming language requires a development environment. That means your students need to install that environment. For many languages, this setup presents another learning curve. With JavaScript, there is no complex setup. Students can simply launch the browser console and start executing code. As you’ll learn in the next chapter, when they want to code from scratch, they can just edit a file in any text editor or write code in any number of online coding playgrounds.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxListPlainB"><strong class="EmphasisBoldBox">Universal accessibility</strong> A drawback to languages like Scratch, Python, and Java is that they require clients to install environments that can run the code if students want to share their programs with others. With JavaScript, students can show off their programs on a phone, computer, or tablet. Any device that runs a browser can run JavaScript, so your students can share their creations with family and the world.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxListPlainB"><strong class="EmphasisBoldBox">Safety</strong> Nearly everyone who surfs the web executes JavaScript in their client browser. As a result, security is always a priority for organizations that build browsers. If it were possible to do anything malicious with JavaScript, organizations would rapidly patch their browsers against it.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxListPlainB"><strong class="EmphasisBoldBox">Exciting possibilities</strong> With JavaScript, you can draw pictures on an HTML canvas, perform complex math equations, validate a form, build a game, animate cartoons, and write music. JavaScript can do anything the front end of a website can do.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxListPlainB"><strong class="EmphasisBoldBox">Transferable skills</strong> The syntax, functions, and various coding concepts in JavaScript are highly applicable to other languages. If you know JavaScript, you can more easily learn PHP, C#, Python, or Java because the same basic methods are used, and the formal logic is identical.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxListPlainB"><strong class="EmphasisBoldBox">Advanceable skills</strong> Although this book focuses on client-side JavaScript, extensions of the language, like Node.js, are empowering JavaScript on the server side. There, students can explore database interaction, file writing, and other features that will expand what they can do.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxListPlainB"><strong class="EmphasisBoldBox">Openness</strong> When writing any JavaScript code, the entire web becomes a resource for examples on how to do it. Using the DOM Inspector, students can quickly see how to accomplish any online feature. Combine this with JavaScript’s long-lived popularity, and students can quickly find code samples for any question they might have about how to code something.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxListPlainC"><strong class="EmphasisBoldBox">Community support</strong> As the most prolific programming language in the world, JavaScript is also one of the most well supported in the online forums. Because every web developer must use it, endless articles and answers are available on how to do anything with this language. In fact, students might find they’ll do less code writing from scratch and more copy-pasting from online peers.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyLast">The one minor drawback to JavaScript is <em class="EmphasisItalicBox">cross-browser compatibility</em>: occasionally, the same code will exhibit different behaviors depending on the browser interpreting it. But this is no longer the issue it once was, because browsers are more standardized today. The code in this book is cross-browser compatible, and in the next chapter, you’ll learn how to handle situations when a feature exists in one browser but not another.</p>&#13;

</aside><p class="Body">As your students enter code into the console, they’ll see lists of suggestions for nodes and functions they can access at each point in the chain. This feature is known as <em class="EmphasisItalic">intelligent code completion</em> and is available in many coding environments. These suggestions help you quickly write syntactically correct code. If you type <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">document.body.on</span> in the console, code completion will provide you with a list of <em class="EmphasisItalic">event listeners</em>. These listeners are functions that trigger when the user interacts with the page in specific ways pertaining to the node, such as those in Figure 5-7.</p>&#13;
<figure>&#13;

<figcaption class="Caption">Figure 5-7: Intelligent code completion</figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="Body">With the line of code in Listing 5-5, you can set an event listener on the <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">body</span> so an alert message pops up when the user clicks anywhere on the page.</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; <span class="LiteralBold _idGenCharOverride-1">document.body.onclick = function() { alert('THAT TICKLES!'); }</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="Listing">Listing 5-5: Set an alert message to pop up when the user clicks the page.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">If you sequentially execute the code in Listings 5-3, 5-4, and 5-5, you should be able to erase almost any website and replace it with a blue page that displays <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">Hello, World!</span> and pops up an alert showing <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">THAT TICKLES!</span> whenever the user clicks it. This is a good place to draw your students’ attention back to the elements panel in the web development tools. There they’ll find that the changes they’ve made programmatically are reflected in the HTML, the <strong class="EmphasisBold">Styles</strong> tab, and the <strong class="EmphasisBold">Event Listeners</strong> tab. The tools reflect the current state of the page. If students right-click the page and select <strong class="EmphasisBold">View Source</strong> or <strong class="EmphasisBold">View Page Source</strong>, they’ll see the markup and code of the page’s initial state before it was modified. It’s best to make students aware of this so they know that what they see in the web development tools is often not the web page’s initial source code.</p>&#13;

<h2 class="BoxHead">The JavaScript Floating-Point Error</h2>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">The fact that computers think in base-2 and humans think in base-10 produces some fascinating and infuriating phenomena in computer programming. Using JavaScript in the console, this exercise illustrates one problem that has every developer scratching their head in befuddlement at some point in their career.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">In the web development tools console, enter the line of JavaScript code in Listing 5-6 and press <span class="Keycap">enter </span>to execute it. </p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; <span class="LiteralBold _idGenCharOverride-1">console.log(eval(.2 + .1));</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="BoxListing">Listing 5-6: Add .2 and .1 in JavaScript.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">The <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">eval(.2 + .1)</span> portion tells the browser to execute the equation 2 + .1, and <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">console.log()</span> tells the browser to write the output to the console. Once executed, you should see <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">0.30000000000000004</span>, not <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">0.3</span> as you might expect. To understand why this happens, we need to consider how computers compute fractions at the hardware level.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">In our base-10 number system, we have certain repeating fractions. For ­example, 1/3 in decimal is 0.33333 . . . , 1/6 in decimal is 0.16666 . . . , and 1/7 is 0.142857142857 . . . . Some decimals that are non-repeating in base-10 do repeat in base-2. For example, the fraction 1/10 is 0.1 in base-10, but in base-2, it’s 0.000110011 . . . , and 1/5 is 0.2 in the former but 0.00110011 . . . in the latter.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">As we learned in Chapter 3, there are many layers between the ones and zeros of machine language and our high-level programming code. The very simple explanation of the behavior we see here is that the computer only has so many bits with which to store these infinitely repeating fractions. If the computer only allotted enough memory to store four decimal places for each number, the decimal 0.1 would be stored as 0.0011 in binary, which would be converted to 0.0625 in decimal. That’s a significate loss of precision. Fortunately, we allot enough storage for these numbers so the imprecision is extremely small.</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">Nevertheless, we still need to compensate for the issue in our code. There are many ways to do this, and Listing 5-7 provides a popular example you can test.</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; <span class="LiteralBold _idGenCharOverride-1">console.log(eval(.2 + .1).toPrecision(1));</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="BoxListing">Listing 5-7: Fixing the floating-point error in JavaScript</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBody">The <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">toPrecision()</span> function rounds the resulting decimal result to one place, giving us the expected 0.3 result. But the lesson doesn’t stop there. One great aspect of programming code is how it empowers exploration. You can explore the differences between the number bases by entering the code in Listing 5-8 in the browser console.</p>&#13;
<pre>console.log(parseInt('42',10).toString(16));&#13;
console.log(parseInt('2a',16).toString(10));&#13;
console.log(parseInt('42',10).toString(2));&#13;
console.log(parseInt('101010',2).toString(10));</pre>&#13;
<p class="BoxListing">Listing 5-8: Translating results into different base number systems</p>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyLast">The <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">parseInt(string, radix)</span> function takes a string argument and converts it to a number in the defined radix, or base number system. Once converted to a number, the <span class="LiteralBox _idGenCharOverride-1">toString(radix)</span> function converts it back into a string in the requested radix, or base, so “42” in base-10 becomes “2a” in base-16 and “101010” in base-2. By experimenting with the values in these functions, you might discover that the non-repeating fractions in binary are 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64, and so on. What patterns can you find in base-12 or base-64? Take some time to enjoy the experience of discovering patterns while the computer does the number crunching.</p>&#13;

</section>&#13;
</aside><p class="Body">Once your students understand how to execute code in the console, let them explore on their own. What would they like to see happen on a web page? It’s tricky to execute sophisticated code in the console, so remind them to keep the scope simple. Some examples they can find online might include <em class="EmphasisItalic">How do I change a web page’s background to a random color on click? How do I make text blink on and off when the user hovers over it? How do I make the page automatically scroll?</em> Your students will quickly find that almost any question they can think of has already been asked by one of the other seven billion humans on the planet and answered by many of those helpful humans.</p>&#13;
<h2 class="HeadA"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>Summary</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">In this chapter, we threw our students into a mind-boggling deluge of information available in any web browser and had them dive into engaging with what they find there. The web development tools have a definitive wow factor that gets students sitting up in their chairs and engaging with the content. After you introduce your students to these powerful tools, hopefully many of them will rush home to excitedly show their friends and family what they’ve discovered. They’ll have the power to do so because this identical environment is available on their home and library computers, and this is how it should be.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">But often, programming classes take a more roundabout approach. In a 2002 essay titled “A Mathematician’s Lament,” math teacher Paul Lockhart speculates on a world in which we teach music the way we teach math to make students competitive in an “increasingly sound-filled world.” He describes the arduous, meaningless exercises children in this dystopia go through at all grade levels: students memorizing algorithms and getting graded on the correctness of their musical notation, and stressed-out parents hiring tutors for their children who are bored with it and spend their music sessions staring out the window humming tunes to themselves instead of learning music. When the students get to college, they’re finally allowed to play and listen to actual music, and appreciate what all those years of busywork were leading up to, but only if they major in music.</p>&#13;
<p class="Body">A programming class that spends the first hour getting students to output a single <span class="Literal _idGenCharOverride-1">"Hello, World!"</span> in code is a soul-crushingly tedious way to teach coding. The more rapidly we can get students hacking and immediately rewarding them with outputs from the code they input, the more engaged they’ll become and the faster they’ll rise to the challenges of this new environment. </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">Only when students have had an opportunity to thoroughly enjoy coding as a playground of instant rewards can we begin to guide their newfound skills into more formal computational artifacts. JavaScript allows students to implement variables and the various control structures we learned about in the previous chapter into algorithms and functions. But students will need an environment where they can save their work, return to it, and iteratively enhance it if they want to take full advantage of these programming elements. </p>&#13;
<p class="Body">In the next chapter, we’ll learn about some readily available development environments where your students can graduate from temporary modifications to existing websites and start crafting web applications of their own to share with their peers.</p>&#13;

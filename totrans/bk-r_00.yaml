    because it makes many modern statistical methods, both simple and advanced, readily
    available and easy to use. It’s true, however, that a beginner to R is often new
    to programming in general. As a beginner, you must not only learn to use R for
    your specific data analysis goals but also learn to think like a programmer. This
    is partly why R has a bit of a reputation for being “hard”—but rest assured, that
    really isn’t the case.

- en: R is based heavily on the S language, first developed in the 1960s and 1970s
    by researchers at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey (for an overview, see, for example,
    [Becker et al., 1988](ref.xhtml#ref07)). With a view to embracing open source
    software, R’s developers—Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of
    Auckland in New Zealand—released it in the early 1990s under the GNU public license.
    (The software was named for Ross and Robert’s shared first initial.) Since then,
    the popularity of R has grown in leaps and bounds because of its unrivaled flexibility
    for data analysis and powerful graphical tools, all available for the princely
    sum of *nothing*. Perhaps the most appealing feature of R is that any researcher
    can contribute code in the form of *packages* (or *libraries*), so the rest of
    the world has fast access to developments in statistics and data science (see
    [Section A.2](app01.xhtml#app01lev1sec97)).

    as the *R Core Team*, and R is a collaborative effort. You can find the names
    of the most prominent contributors at *[http://www.r-project.org/](http://www.r-project.org/)*;
    these individuals deserve thanks for their ongoing efforts, which keep R alive
    and at the forefront of statistical computing!

    substantial changes to the software over time, though neighboring versions are
    typically similar to one another. In this book, I’ve employed versions 3.0.1–3.2.2\.

    on R as a computational and programming tool and then shifting gears to discuss
    using R for probability, statistics, and data exploration and modeling. You’ll
    build your knowledge up progressively, and at the end of each chapter, you’ll
    find a section summarizing the important code as a quick reference.

    types used across all aspects of R programming, is essential for beginners. [Chapters
    2](ch02.xhtml#ch02) through [5](ch05.xhtml#ch05) introduce the basics of simple
    arithmetic, assignment, and important object types such as vectors, matrices,
    lists, and data frames. In [Chapter 6](ch06.xhtml#ch06), I’ll discuss the way
    R represents missing data values and distinguishes among different object types.
    You’re given a primer on plotting in [Chapter 7](ch07.xhtml#ch07), using both
    built-in and contributed functionality (via the `ggplot2` package—see [Wickham,
    2009](ref.xhtml#ref72)); this chapter lays the groundwork for graphical design
    discussed later in the book. In [Chapter 8](ch08.xhtml#ch08), I’ll cover the fundamentals
    of reading data in from external files, essential for analysis of your own collected
    data.'

    cover loops and conditional statements, which are used to control the flow, repetition,
    and execution of your code, before teaching you how to write your own executable
    R functions in [Chapter 11](ch11.xhtml#ch11). The examples in these two chapters
    are designed primarily to help you understand the behavior of these mechanisms
    rather than to present real-world analyses. I’ll also cover some additional topics,
    such as error handling and measuring function execution time, in [Chapter 12](ch12.xhtml#ch12).'

    thinking in [Part III](part03.xhtml#part03). In [Chapter 13](ch13.xhtml#ch13),
    you’ll look at important terminology used to describe variables; elementary summary
    statistics such as the mean, variance, quantiles, and correlation; and how these
    statistics are implemented in R. Turning again to plotting, [Chapter 14](ch14.xhtml#ch14)
    covers how to visually explore your data (with both built-in and `ggplot2` functionality)
    by using and customizing common statistical plots such as histograms and box-and-whisker
    plots. [Chapter 15](ch15.xhtml#ch15) gives an overview of the concepts of probability
    and random variables, and then you’ll look at the R implementation and statistical
    interpretation of some common probability distributions in [Chapter 16](ch16.xhtml#ch16).

    testing and linear regression models. [Chapter 17](ch17.xhtml#ch17) introduces
    sampling distributions and confidence intervals. [Chapter 18](ch18.xhtml#ch18)
    details hypothesis testing and *p*-values and demonstrates implementation and
    interpretation using R; the common ANOVA procedure is then discussed in [Chapter
    19](ch19.xhtml#ch19). In [Chapters 20](ch20.xhtml#ch20) and [21](ch21.xhtml#ch21),
    you’ll explore linear regression modeling in detail, including model fitting and
    dealing with different types of predictor variables, inferring and predicting,
    and dealing with variable transformation and interactive effects. Rounding off
    [Part IV](part04.xhtml#part04), [Chapter 22](ch22.xhtml#ch22) discusses methods
    for selecting an appropriate linear model and assessing the validity of that model
    with various diagnostic tools.

    starting point for learning about statistical regression. Similarly, the R syntax
    and output used to fit, summarize, predict from, and diagnose linear models of
    this kind are much the same for other regression models—so once you’re comfortable
    with these chapters, you’ll be ready to tackle the R implementation of more complicated
    models covered in more advanced texts with relative ease.

    devices themselves to controlling the finer aspects of your plot’s appearance.
    In [Chapter 24](ch24.xhtml#ch24), you’ll study the popular `ggplot2` package further,
    looking at more advanced features such as adding smooth scatterplot trends and
    producing multiple plots via faceting. The final two chapters concentrate on higher
    dimensional plotting in R. [Chapter 25](ch25.xhtml#ch25) covers color handling
    and 3D surface preparation before discussing contour plots, perspective plots,
    and pixel images with the aid of multiple examples. [Chapter 26](ch26.xhtml#ch26)

    multivariate parametric equations.

    (at Massey University in Palmerston North, New Zealand). Building on little more
    than the odd line or two of code I’d encountered during my undergraduate years
    in Australia, being “thrown in the deep end” had both benefits and drawbacks.

    more, nothing less. When something doesn’t work as expected or an error occurs,
    this literal behavior works in your favor. Look carefully at the commands line
    by line and try to narrow down the instructions that caused the fault.

    Download the *.zip* file and extract the *.R* files, one for each part of the
    book. Open these in your R session, and you can run the lines like you would any
    R code to see the output. The short practice exercises are intended to be exactly
    that—practice—as opposed to being hard or insurmountable challenges. Everything
    you need to know to complete them will be contained in the preceding sections
    of that chapter.

    try to use R for everything, even for very simple tasks or calculations you might
    usually do elsewhere. This will force your mind to switch to “R mode” more often,
    and it’ll get you comfortable with the environment quickly.

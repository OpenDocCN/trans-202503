    developments, find additional software, and get help. Because software resources
    are likely to change, I’ll maintain a copy of this appendix at the GitHub repository
    that contains all the book’s resources. You can find a link to GitHub via [https://nostarch.com/practical-sql-2nd-edition/](https://nostarch.com/practical-sql-2nd-edition/).

    to PostgreSQL, run queries, and view database objects. Although pgAdmin is free,
    open source, and popular, it’s not your only choice for working with PostgreSQL.
    The wiki entry “PostgreSQL Clients” at [https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PostgreSQL_Clients](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PostgreSQL_Clients)
    catalogs many alternatives.

    The free tools work well for general analysis work. If you wade deeper into database
    development, you might want to upgrade to the paid options, which typically offer
    advanced features and support.

    along with an FAQ and wiki on the main page at [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/).
    It’s worth reading sections of the manual as you learn more about a topic, such
    as indexes, or search for all the options that come with functions. In particular,
    the “Preface,” “Tutorial,” and “SQL Language” sections cover much of the material
    presented in the book’s chapters.

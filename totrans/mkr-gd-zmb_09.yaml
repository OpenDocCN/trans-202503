    9-1](ch09.html#ch09fig1)). They are rather lacking in brains, after all. The projects
    in this chapter are designed to draw zombies’ attention away from you using flashes
    of light, loud sounds, and decoy movements. Imagine you have a herd of zombies
    lurching around the garage door but you need to get to your last remaining car
    battery. These distractors will allow you to draw the zombies away from the door
    or even lure them into a fatal zombie trap, perhaps involving fire and a big hole
    in the ground.

    the instructions should be sufficiently general to work with any disposable camera.)
    Also, find cameras that have a switch that turns the flash on for multiple photos,
    not the sort that make you press the flash button between each shot. For example,

- en: Piezo buzzers (also called sounders) contain crystals that change shape when
    a current is passed through them. The current changes hundreds of times per second,
    and as the crystals change shape, sound waves are produced. Although you can drive
    a piezo buzzer by connecting one lead to GND and supplying a signal to the other
    lead, you get a higher volume by using two Arduino outputs to completely reverse
    the polarity of the buzzer with each cycle. [Figure 9-17](ch09.html#ch09fig17)
    shows how this works.

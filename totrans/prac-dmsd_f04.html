By day, he is an accomplished security researcher who has been working in information security since the late 1990s, helping companies map out and manage risk in the digital domain. He is the author of two classic security books, <em>The Tangled Web</em> and <em>Silence on the Wire</em> (both No Starch Press), and a recipient of the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Pwnie award. He spent 11 years at Google building its product security program before joining Snap Inc. as a VP of Security &amp; Privacy Engineering. Zalewski grew up in Poland under communist rule, lived through the fall of the Soviet Bloc, and moved to the United States in 2001.</p>

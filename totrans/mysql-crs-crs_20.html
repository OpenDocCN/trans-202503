<p class="PartIntro">Congratulations! You now know enough about MySQL to begin building meaningful projects. In this part of the book, you’ll work through three projects that will teach you new skills and provide a deeper understanding of the material presented so far.</p>
<p>These projects, outlined below, are independent of one another and can be completed in any order:</p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Building a Weather Database</b></p>
<ol class="none">
<li>You’ll build a database to store current weather data for a trucking company using technologies including cron, Bash, and SQL scripts.</li>
</ol>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Tracking Changes to Voter Data with Triggers</b></p>
<ol class="none">
<li>You’ll build a database to hold election data and build triggers on the tables to track changes to the voter data.</li>
</ol>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Protecting Salary Data with Views</b></p>
<ol class="none">

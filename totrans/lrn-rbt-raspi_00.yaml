  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Robots are all around us. They build the products you use every day. They save
    lives in surgery. They even explore Mars and the rest of our solar system. As
    tech improves, humans rely on robots more and more to make our lives easier, better,
    and safer. With the rise of artificial intelligence, it won’t be long until things
    like driverless cars and smart robotic companions are the norm!

    to satisfy your own curiosity or to embark on a future lucrative career. And besides,
    if you understand even just a *little* bit about robots, you’ll have a much better
    chance at surviving the robot uprising. (Just kidding.)

    areas. Making things? *Check!* Electronics engineering? *Check!* Software programming?
    *Check!* This book is the perfect introduction to all three.

    statement: **because it’s fun**. There is something uniquely intriguing and exciting
    about watching something *you* have made run around on the floor, avoid obstacles,
    or flash lights.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Raspberry Pi is a $35 credit card–size computer that was created to provide
    people with an inexpensive introduction to programming and electronics. Despite
    its small size and low cost, each Pi is a fully functional computer that can do
    pretty much everything you would expect, from running programs to word processing
    and web browsing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Raspberry Pi is a great platform to learn robotics with. It’s cheap, small,
    easily powered, and incredibly accessible. You can program a Pi in almost any
    language you can imagine and embed it into all sorts of electronics projects.
    A Pi hits just the right sweet spot between power and simplicity, meaning you
    can create robots without limitations.

- en: Since it was launched out of Cambridge, UK, in 2012, the Raspberry Pi has gained
    a massive worldwide following and community. Millions of people share their progress,
    projects, and ideas online, which makes it easy for beginners to improve and learn
    from someone who knows more. There are also many in-person events where you can
    chat and show off your achievements. These are usually lovingly called *Raspberry
    Jams*, and they take place around the globe.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is project-based, and revolves around a two-wheeled robot that I’ll
    show you how to make from scratch. You’ll improve this robot project by project,
    adding components and coding new functionality. At each stage of the book I’ll
    provide comprehensive instructions and explanations of each build and the program
    behind it. You can also download the full code and resources for free from *[https://nostarch.com/raspirobots/](https://nostarch.com/raspirobots/)*.
    Any updates or further notes from the book can also be found there.

<p class="INTROTNI2">I vividly remember the first time I “wrote” JavaScript. I’d been messing around with web design and copy-pasted some code from another website to add some weird effects whenever the mouse hovered over certain parts of the page. I had no idea what the code was doing, but through trial and error I managed to get something working.</p>
<p class="TX">JavaScript is a very forgiving language—sometimes to a fault—and that made it a very gentle introduction to programming for me and countless others. So many people have chosen JavaScript as a first programming language because of how easy it is to get started: it’s right there waiting for you in your web browser!</p>

<p class="TNI1">The aim of this book is to get you writing real JavaScript code as quickly as possible, teaching all the essentials without getting bogged down in the intricacies of the language. I don’t expect you to have any prior programming experience. If you’re comfortable using a computer for everyday tasks like browsing the internet and editing documents, you have everything you need to get started.</p>
<p class="TX"><i>JavaScript Crash Course</i> is written for individuals of all ages who want to learn JavaScript independently through hands-on examples and projects. Maybe you want to transition into a career in computer programming, or you want to pursue coding as a hobby. Perhaps you’ve worked in other programming languages, and you need to get up to speed in JavaScript. If you’re a teacher and are looking for an easy way to introduce your students to programming, <i>JavaScript Crash Course</i> is a great option for you, too.</p>

<h2 class="H1" id="sec2"><span id="h1-2"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Why JavaScript?</samp></h2>
<p class="TNI1">There are hundreds of programming languages to choose from, but there are a few things that make JavaScript special. Most important is its relationship with web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox. Almost every web browser can run JavaScript, which means the code you write in JavaScript can be run on any computer with a web browser. There’s no need to install any additional special software. Almost all smartphone web browsers can run JavaScript, too, so you may have a JavaScript-enabled browser in your pocket or bag right now.</p>
<p class="TX">Because of its relationship to web browsers, JavaScript is an extremely important part of web development. If a website includes dynamic, interactive features, it was probably created with JavaScript. For example, YouTube uses JavaScript to show you previews of videos when you hover over their thumbnails, Threads uses JavaScript to load more posts as you scroll down the page, and Amazon uses JavaScript to power its Look Inside feature.</p>
<p class="TX">Beyond its use in web browsers, JavaScript is also heavily used on the <i>backend</i> of websites, or the part of the website code that runs on a server, delivering content to users (as opposed to the <i>frontend</i> code that runs directly on the user’s device). This is possible via a technology called Node.js. Many top websites have a Node.js backend, letting you use the same language for the frontend and backend of your website, and even share code between the two.</p>
<p class="TX">Finally, JavaScript has become a very popular scripting language for various applications, from Photoshop (where you can automate image processing) to Gmail (where you can add automations that organize your email). With some JavaScript knowledge, you can bend these applications to your will!</p>
<p class="TX">While the language is useful in all these areas, this book will focus solely on browser-based JavaScript. There are a few reasons for this. First, as I’ve already mentioned, one of the great advantages of running JavaScript in a browser is that you don’t have to install anything special to get started. I didn’t want to begin the book with a tedious chapter on installing Node.js <span aria-label=" Page xxi. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xxi" role="doc-pagebreak"/>on your computer—a chapter that could become outdated as soon as it was written. Second, while virtually all websites use JavaScript for the frontend, JavaScript is just one among many possible languages for writing backend code. The browser is by far the most universally applicable context for learning JavaScript.</p>
<p class="TX">I still highly recommend checking out Node.js and other uses for JavaScript after you finish this book and have some experience with the language. You should see the book as a jumping-off point: the beginning, rather than the end, of your JavaScript education.

<h2 class="H1" id="sec3"><span id="h1-3"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">What Can You Expect to Learn?</samp></h2>
<p class="TNI1">This book will teach you browser-based JavaScript. Beyond learning the JavaScript language itself, you’ll also learn skills that will help you in <i>any</i> programming language, such as how to think about problems and how to structure programs. You’ll build a foundation of programming knowledge that will stick with you throughout your professional and personal coding endeavors.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="Xref"><a href="part1.xhtml">Part I</a></span> of this book lays out the basics of the language. I’ve been very intentional about the ordering of language concepts and features, making sure that every new concept builds on previous ones and never introducing anything that doesn’t have a solid foundation. Here’s what you’ll find in this part of the book:</p>
<p class="RunInPara1"><b><a href="chapter1.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>: Getting Started    </b>Shows you how to write your first lines of JavaScript in both a web browser and a text editor.</p>
<p class="RunInPara"><b><a href="chapter2.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>: The Basics</b>    Introduces basic ingredients of JavaScript programs, like expressions, statements, and variables, and explains how to use simple data types to represent numbers, text, and true/false values.</p>
<p class="RunInPara"><b><a href="chapter3.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>: Compound Data Types</b>    Discusses arrays and objects, which let you combine multiple pieces of data into more meaningful collections.</p>
<p class="RunInPara"><b><a href="chapter4.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>: Conditionals and Loops</b>    Teaches you to add logic to your programs with control structures that can make decisions and repeat segments of code.</p>
<p class="RunInPara"><b><a href="chapter5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>: Functions    </b>Shows you how to create reusable pieces of code with functions.</p>
<p class="RunInPara2"><b><a href="chapter6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>: Classes</b>    Helps you add more structure to your code with classes and object-oriented programming principles.</p>
<p class="TX"><span class="Xref"><a href="part2.xhtml">Part II</a></span> of the book discusses how to use JavaScript to work with web browsers. This section explores important techniques for creating interactive web applications:</p>
<p class="RunInPara1"><b><a href="chapter7.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>: HTML, the DOM, and CSS    </b>Explains how to write web pages in HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and modify their content with JavaScript using the Document Object Model (DOM). You’ll <span aria-label=" Page xxii. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xxii" role="doc-pagebreak"/>also learn how to apply basic styling to web pages using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).</p>
<p class="RunInPara"><b><a href="chapter8.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>: Event-Based Programming</b>    Shows how to trigger JavaScript code in response to user behaviors such as mouse clicks and key presses.</p>
<p class="RunInPara2"><b><a href="chapter9.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>: The Canvas Element    </b>Teaches you to draw graphics and animations in the browser with JavaScript using the Canvas API.</p>
<p class="TX">Finally, <span class="Xref"><a href="part3.xhtml">Part III</a></span> of the book lets you put the skills you gained in <span class="Xref"><a href="part1.xhtml">Parts I</a></span> and <span class="Xref"><a href="part2.xhtml">II</a></span> to use through a series of projects. There are no dependencies between the projects, so you can tackle them in any order, or only work on the projects you find most interesting. I would recommend completing all of them if possible, as they all introduce some valuable general-purpose programming concepts. Each project spans two chapters:</p>
<p class="RunInPara1"><b><a href="part4.xhtml">Project 1</a>: Creating a Game    </b>Guides you through making your own version of the classic Atari game <i>Pong</i>. This project will put to use your skills with the Canvas API and tie together all the basics you learned about data structures, conditionals, and functions. After you’ve developed the game in <span class="runinpara_Xref"><a href="chapter10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a></span>, <span class="runinpara_Xref"><a href="chapter11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a></span> shows you how to restructure its code using classes and object-oriented design principles.</p>
<p class="RunInPara"><b><a href="part5.xhtml">Project 2</a>: Making Music</b>    Explores how to make music using JavaScript. <span class="runinpara_Xref"><a href="chapter12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a></span> explains how to use the Web Audio API and a library called Tone.js to generate sounds. Then <span class="runinpara_Xref"><a href="chapter13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a></span> puts together what you’ve learned to create a song. Once you’ve completed this project, you’ll not only be able to create your own music, but you’ll also have gained some experience working with complex third-party libraries.</p>
<p class="RunInPara2"><b><a href="part6.xhtml">Project 3</a>: Visualizing Data</b>    Introduces you to the world of data visualization using the popular D3 library. <span class="runinpara_Xref"><a href="chapter14.xhtml">Chapter 14</a></span> teaches the basics of D3 and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), an alternative to the Canvas API for drawing in the browser. Then, in <span class="runinpara_Xref"><a href="chapter15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a></span>, you’ll build an application to dynamically visualize data loaded from across the internet. This project illustrates how to request data through a third-party API, an important programming skill.</p>

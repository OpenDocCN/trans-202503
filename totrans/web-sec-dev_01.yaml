    effective web developer. Before getting started on that, it’s a useful exercise
    to see how you would go about attacking a website. Let’s put ourselves in the
    shoes of our adversary to see what we are up against. This chapter will show you
    how hackers operate and how easy it is to get started hacking.

- en: Hackers take advantage of security holes in software such as websites. In the
    hacking community, a piece of code that illustrates how to take advantage of a
    security flaw is called an *exploit*. Some hackers—the good guys, commonly called
    *white hat hackers*—try to discover security holes for fun, and will advise software
    vendors and website owners of the exploits *before* making them public. Such hackers
    often collect a financial reward for doing so.

    (exploits that have been publicized for less than a day, or not publicized at
    all) as soon as possible. However, even when a software vendor releases a patch
    to fix a software vulnerability, many instances of the vulnerable software will
    remain unpatched for some time.

    windows during which they can use vulnerabilities, or will even sell the exploit
    code on black markets for bitcoin. On today’s internet, exploits get rapidly weaponized
    and incorporated into command line tools widely used by the hacking community.

- en: Solid financial incentives exist for black-hat hackers who use these exploitation
    tools. Black markets for stolen credit card details, hacked user accounts, and
    zero-day exploits exist on the *dark web*, websites available only via special
    network nodes that anonymize incoming IP addresses. Dark websites, like the one
    pictured in [Figure 1-1](ch01.xhtml#ch1fig1), do a brisk business in stolen information
    and compromised servers.

    the Linux operating system specifically built for hackers. It comes preinstalled
    with more than 600 security and hacking tools. It’s completely free and is maintained
    by a small team of professional security researchers at Offensive Security.

    environments that allow you to install other operating systems on your computer,
    without overwriting your current operating system. Oracle’s VirtualBox is free
    to use and can be installed on Windows, macOS, or Linux. This should allow you
    to run Kali Linux on your computer without too much configuration.

    in [Figure 1-2](ch01.xhtml#ch1fig2), is the most popular command line tool for
    testing the security of websites and checking for vulnerabilities.

    and see what vulnerabilities you can find. The output should look something like
    [Figure 1-3](ch01.xhtml#ch1fig3). The `wmap` utility will scan a list of URLs
    to test whether the web server exhibits security flaws. Make sure you run the
    utility only on a website you own!

    likely constitute a felony. However, the main point should be apparent: it’s really
    easy to start hacking websites! Metasploit and Kali Linux are used by real-world
    hackers and can be set up in a few minutes. They don’t require any particular
    expertise to use, yet they are phenomenally good at identifying vulnerabilities
    in websites and exploiting them.'

    we build are available to anyone with an internet connection, as are the hacking
    tools that can be used to target them. Don’t panic, though! By the end of the
    book, you will (hopefully) know as much about security as the hackers themselves,
    and be fully prepared for when they attack your site. So, let’s get started by
    discussing the building blocks of the internet protocol suite.

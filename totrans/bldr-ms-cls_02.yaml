- en: GIMP is a powerful, free, open source image-editing package, with a wealth of
    tools for manipulating and painting graphics. GIMP first appeared in 1996 as the
    project of Spencer Kimball and Peter Matthis, students at the University of California,
    Berkeley. Originally, the acronym GIMP stood for *General Image Manipulation Program*.
    Later, this was redefined to stand for *GNU Image Manipulation Program* when,
    in 1997, GIMP became part of the GNU Project. Since then, GIMP has undergone significant
    (if sporadic) development, and its current feature set is comparable to that of
    commercial image-editing packages, like Adobe Photoshop. GIMP has tools for painting;
    manipulating colors; and working with selections, layers, paths, and channels.
    It also offers a wide variety of filters and plug-ins and supports numerous image
    formats.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might be wondering why I’ve chosen to cover GIMP in a book that is primarily
    about creating 3D art with Blender. The reason is that while Blender is a powerful
    3D graphics application, we’ll need to do some 2D image editing throughout the
    book. For example, we’ll need to prepare reference images, create textures for
    models and alphas for sculpting brushes, and add some final tweaks to our final
    renders. Though Blender does have 2D painting tools within the UV Image editor,
    we really need something more capable and geared toward editing images.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: GIMP is just such a tool, and it makes for an excellent companion application
    to Blender when creating 3D digital art. In [Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Preparation"),
    we will prepare (or even paint) our reference images in GIMP, using guides to
    align orthographic references and layers to create collages out of multiple images
    for quick reference. In [Chapter 11](ch11.html "Chapter 11. Texture Painting"),
    we will do some of our texture painting in GIMP, using layers to combine baked
    images with other elements, such as photos, and we’ll use GIMP’s painting tools
    to refine and add to textures we paint in Blender. Finally, in [Chapter 14](ch14.html
    "Chapter 14. Rendering and Compositing"), we will do some touching up of our final
    renders in GIMP.

- en: Like that of Blender, GIMP’s user interface is known for being a little unorthodox.
    Primarily, this is due to its default multi-window layout, where the canvas, Toolbox,
    and other dialogs are split into separate windows. This is easy enough to get
    used to, but for a tidier layout, switch to the non-blocking, single-window layout
    by enabling Single-Window mode in the Windows menu (see [Figure 2-1](ch02.html#single-window_mode_in_gimp_arranges_all
    "Figure 2-1. Single-Window mode in GIMP arranges all of GIMP’s tools and dialogs
    in a single window. The default single-window layout in GIMP should look something
    like this.")). Most of the screenshots in this book use this layout, with extra
    dialogs added as needed.

    and *Ellipse Select* tools let you make selections using particular shapes. *Lasso
    Select* lets you draw freehand selections. *Magic Select* automatically selects
    areas that are similar to the areas you click on the canvas, and *Select by Color*
    selects similar colors. *Scissors Select* lets you draw a rough outline around
    a selection by clicking to place a series of points; then GIMP tries to generate
    the best selection by detecting edges in the image. *Foreground Select* lets you
    define a rough foreground area by painting on it, and then it tries to generate
    a selection using the painted area as a guide.'

    from one part of the canvas (the clone source) to another (wherever you paint)
    and are therefore useful for creating textures and filling in areas. The Heal
    tool is particularly useful, as it automatically blends together the boundaries
    of the newly cloned pixels with the original surroundings. CTRL-clicking on the
    canvas sets the clone source, after which you can stroke normally to clone pixels
    from the source to another area on the canvas.'

    most brushes paint with the foreground color, with the background color acting
    as an alternate color that you can quickly switch to by pressing **X**. (Some
    tools, such as the Gradient tool, use both foreground and background colors at
    the same time.) The two small icons at the upper right and bottom left of the
    color swatches allow you to switch between them and reset them to black and white,

    selections, and use all of GIMP’s other tools by clicking the canvas. Rulers down
    the left and top edges of the canvas show the position of the cursor with small
    arrows as you move around. Clicking and dragging out from these rulers creates
    vertical and horizontal guides that your cursor and selections will snap to by
    default. This snapping action can come in handy when lining up images for use
    as reference (as you’ll learn in [Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Preparation")).
    Along the bottom of the canvas are options for controlling the rulers’ units of
    measurement and the zoom level of the canvas.

    "Figure 2-1. Single-Window mode in GIMP arranges all of GIMP’s tools and dialogs
    in a single window. The default single-window layout in GIMP should look something
    like this."), Tool Options on the left below the toolbox, and the Layers dialog
    on the top right with the Channels, Paths, and Undo dialogs. The Tool Options
    dialog contains the options for the currently selected tool that define how it
    works. For example, in the case of the Paint Brush tool, the Tool Options dialog
    lets you adjust the brush opacity, shape, size, and aspect ratio, as well as allowing
    you to choose from GIMP’s brush dynamics options. The Layers dialog displays the
    layers that make up the current image and lets you toggle their visibility, lock
    them to prevent further editing, or edit their blend modes to change how they
    combine with other layers. The icons at the bottom of the Layers dialog let you
    add, delete, and duplicate layers, as well as create groups to organize layers.
    (We’ll cover working with and organizing layers in further detail when we discuss
    painting textures in [Chapter 11](ch11.html "Chapter 11. Texture Painting").)

    dialogs are already grouped and organized into tabs and columns down the sides
    of the main canvas when in Single-Window mode. To rearrange tabs, click and drag
    the icon at the top of the dialog either into another group of tabs or to the
    border between two areas of the UI to place the tab in its own row or column.

    start the program, you can either open an existing image (File▸Open) or create
    a new one (File▸New). When opening images, GIMP normally opens each image as a
    new file, but you can use File▸Open as Layers instead to open images as new layers
    within the current file.

    Options dialog, such as opacity or size, you can also choose from a variety of
    brush shapes in the Brushes dialog (see [Figure 2-3](ch02.html#some_of_gimpapostrophes_brush_shapes

    the pressure input from a graphics tablet to affect the look of your stroke. These
    options are called Paint Dynamics in GIMP. You can choose different dynamics from
    the Tool Options dialog or create and edit your own in the Paint Dynamics Editor
    dialog. (We will examine this feature in more detail when creating our own brushes

    algorithm to the pixels of the current layer to create a new result. There are
    several filters, including ones for blurring and sharpening images, removing or
    creating noise, and distorting and deforming images. You will also find filters
    that apply artistic effects and ones that allow you to create completely new images
    and patterns from scratch.

    composited on top of one another, combining elements from each. The Layers dialog
    shows you all the layers in your image and allows you to edit their ordering and
    how they are combined. By default, each layer replaces the one below it, with
    any transparent parts letting the layer underneath show through. However, you
    can also choose from several other ways to blend layers using the Layer Mode drop-down
    menu at the top of the Layers dialog.

- en: One way to restrict the pixels you paint on is to use GIMP’s selection tools.
    With these, you can draw out a selection you wish to work on within the current
    layer. Brushes, filters, and other tools will then affect only the selected pixels
    (see [Figure 2-5](ch02.html#creating_a_selection_left_parenthesissho "Figure 2-5. Creating
    a selection (shown highlighted in the top image) lets you restrict GIMP’s tools
    to a particular area of your image.")). Selections come in handy when you want
    to work on an isolated part of an image. They also let you copy (CTRL-C) and paste
    (CTRL-V) parts of your image or split part of an image off into a new layer. We’ll
    cover these tools in more detail in [Chapter 11](ch11.html "Chapter 11. Texture

    dragging out a selection. In later chapters, we’ll look at other ways to work
    with selections using tools like GIMP’s Quick Mask feature.

    and exporting it (CTRL-E) to a more conventional image format, such as a JPEG
    or Targa. You can choose the image format to export to by adding the correct suffix
    to the file name (for example, *.jpg* for JPEG and *.tga* for Targa) or by selecting
    it manually from the list at the bottom of the Save dialog (see [Figure 2-6](ch02.html#saving_images_in_gimp

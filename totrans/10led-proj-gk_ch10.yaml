    LED clothes at night is a sure way to stand out. This chapter will show you how
    to construct an LED sash that scrolls text and lets you interact with it wirelessly.
    As the final project in this book, it’s a little more difficult than the other
    projects, in terms of both electronics and construction of the sash itself. But
    the payoff is a sash whose scrolling text you can alter and update on the move
    through your phone.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Battery capacity is a compromise between weight, cost, and endurance. To figure
    out what your project needs in terms of battery capacity, first check how many
    LEDs you have. The array I have is 8 × 32 LEDs, meaning I have 256 LEDs total.
    Most of the time an LED will use a max draw of 60 mA (full bright white light),
    with an average use of 20 mA. So if we multiply that by our number of LEDs, our
    calculations show our sash will have a maximum draw of 15,360 mA (~15.5 A) and
    an average draw of 5,120 mA (5 A).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, since our LEDs will display scrolling text, most will be off at any
    given time, so our actual use will be much less than that. With a multimeter,
    I measured current draw of between 0.5 and 0.7 A for my final project. On that
    amp draw, a 3,600 mAh battery will last about 5 hours and a 5,000 mAh battery
    will last about 7 hours.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you want to use the array for something else that runs all the LEDs at once
    and need the higher amp draw, the 3,600 mAh battery will last 13 to 42 minutes
    and the 5,000 mAh will last 20 to 58 minutes. Those numbers aren’t exact—batteries
    are never exact—and you lose a bit of power with the voltage regulator and the
    other components, so it’s best to overestimate your needs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For this project, I recommend a NiMH battery that’s 7.2 V 5,000 mAh. The LEDs
    and the Photon need 5 V, and at 7.2 V this battery provides the closest voltage.
    Later, we’ll use a regulator to take the voltage down to 5 V to avoid damaging
    parts.

    You’ll need to be fairly comfortable with soldering for this part.
  prefs: []

    Deans plugs have two terminals, shaped like a T. The horizontal terminal (the
    top of the T) is usually for the power (red) wire, and the vertical terminal is
    for the ground (black) wire. Label the Deans plug with a **+** for the horizontal

    turning it clockwise and note which direction makes the voltage increase and decrease.

    server to send text messages, but other options are available too. Small pictures,
    colors, and designs are all available. Just remember: the more LEDs on at one
    time, the more current draw. Go out in the world with your own fantastic LED sash!'

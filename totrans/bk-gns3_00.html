From the beginning I could see it was going to be an invaluable networking tool. I’ve used it to get hands-on experience with operating systems such as Cisco IOS, Junos OS, and Arista, as well as to pass quite a few network certification exams. To this day, I use it on a regular basis to test router configurations before deploying real equipment to the field. <span class="emphasis"><em>The Book of GNS3</em></span> is my way of sharing this great resource with other networking professionals, like you.</p><div class="sect1" title="Who This Book Is For"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="who_this_book_is_for"/>Who This Book Is For</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is for anyone involved with networking routers, switches, or firewalls. Whether you use Cisco, Juniper, Arista, Vyatta, or some other network operating system, GNS3 is a great alternative to building physical labs. Unlike labs that use physical equipment, GNS3 virtual labs let you create and save unlimited network configurations, without having to tear apart an existing lab. This book covers all the details to get your projects up and running fast.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="What’s in This Book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="whatapostrophes_in_this_book"/>What’s in This Book</h1></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The Book of GNS3</em></span> guides you through installing, configuring, and running GNS3 on Windows, OS X, and Linux, and it shows you some geeky and fun tricks along the way. Whether you’re just getting started or have used GNS3 before, I think you’ll find a new appreciation for how much is possible when you have the right tool. I don’t cover TCP/IP networking fundamentals, but I do provide plenty of examples of how to configure GNS3 devices.</p><div class="sect2" title="My Approach"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="my_approach"/>My Approach</h2></div></div></div><p>The most effective way of learning is by doing. That’s why I use a tutorial-based approach to creating fully functional multivendor labs using GNS3. The tutorials explain how to build and configure labs using the virtual devices introduced in the chapters. I provide examples of configuring Cisco IOS, Junos OS, and Juniper vSRX Firefly, and more. You don’t need to be an expert with network operating systems because I’ll guide you step-by-step through the configurations. You could spend days, or even weeks, searching the Web to figure out how to configure features such as connecting to live switches, creating a virtual access server, or connecting your virtual labs to the Internet. But there’s no need to do that after you read <span class="emphasis"><em>The Book of GNS3.</em></span></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Book Overview"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="book_overview"/>Book Overview</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The Book of GNS3</em></span> guides you through the installation and use of GNS3, and each chapter introduces new concepts that build on skills from previous ones. You’ll learn how to create and manage simple to complex projects, using only a single computer or sharing the load across multiple computers.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Introducing GNS3">Chapter 1</a></strong></span>, covers what GNS3 is and how it works, provides an overview of GNS3, and discusses the benefits of virtual networks.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Installing a Basic GNS3 System">Chapter 2</a></strong></span>, discusses installing GNS3 on Windows, OS X, and Linux, and it explains the benefits of using virtual appliances to run GNS3 as an alternative to installing it directly on your PC.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Configuration">Chapter 3</a></strong></span>, looks at installing a Cisco IOS image and setting up your first virtual router using Dynamips.

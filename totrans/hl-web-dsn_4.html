<h2 class="h2b"><strong>REASSURANCES</strong></h2>
<p class="noindentt1">Dear reader: I have been working on design and websites for around 20 years now and, without fail, this is my mental dialogue on every new project:</p>
<div class="cont">
<p class="noindentt1">“crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap . . . yes!”</p>
</div>
<p class="noindentt1">Sometimes it’s not a “yes!” — sometimes it’s a “maybe?” But the initial “crap” is always, always there.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Design work may never feel easy, especially when you first start out. Your first sketches and mock-ups are more likely to feel terrible than good. Designing, unlike programming, is so qualitative rather than quantitative — we rely on our gut to tell us whether something looks and feels right; you will likely think that your first pieces of work are <em>not</em> working right.</p>
<p class="content_c"><strong>Welcome to designing!</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt1">This isn’t meant to be discouraging — instead, I hope you remember that when you’re working on a new design and it <a id="page_124"/>doesn’t feel like it’s going well, you’re going through the same process as every other designer. Through iteration, inspiration, research, and work, your design will improve.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">When you’re thinking these thoughts, you’re not a bad designer — <strong>you’re <em>a</em> designer.</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt1">Don’t give up, and keep working. I know you can do it! You’ll get better from iteration to iteration, new design work to new design work.<a id="page_125"/><a id="page_126"/></p>

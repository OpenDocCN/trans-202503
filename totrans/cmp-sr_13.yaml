    letters are easier to read (especially for younger generations!), and if you make
    a mistake, you can simply delete your error and retype without making a mess.
    WordPad also lets you change the color, style, and size of your text as well as
    add pictures, which gives your document a professional look and tailors it to
    your needs. You can also save your document so you can revisit it at any time
    in the future.

    entirely free and simple to use to write documents. It certainly doesn’t have
    all the bells and whistles of a full-fledged word processing program like Microsoft
    Word, but it does offer simplicity. Most importantly, WordPad is free, whereas
    Microsoft Word must be paid for. All the features of WordPad also exist in Microsoft
    Word, so if you’re familiar with WordPad, you can easily get started with Microsoft
    Word as well. This means that WordPad is a great starting point, and if you find
    yourself wanting more, you can turn to Microsoft Word later.

<p class="ChapterIntro">This is a set of social engineering pretexts that I have used in the past and found successful. Feel free to use or modify these to fit your needs. I encourage you to build upon these while staying ethical. I would love for you to share some of your modifications of these or your own. If you’re interested, feel free to reach out.</p>
<h2 id="h1-500983b04-0001">Confused Employee</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Maintain a pretext as a clumsy employee, this time confused about the company’s food service and calling HR to ask for help. Call using an internal spoofed number (likely a fax machine number to prevent confusion if target attempts to call back).</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_198" title="198"/>Now, ask about the food service with questions like these:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do they show up on the credit card statements? Who bills?</li>
<li>You have been so helpful; how long have you worked here?</li>
<li>Who is your manager? I want to give you a compliment.</li>
<li>The URL for ordering loads another site, <em>&lt;your phishing site here&gt;</em>; can you check it out?</li>
</ul>
<p>Then say that you are at the end of your break and must urgently clock back into work.</p>
<h2 id="h1-500983b04-0002">IT Inventory</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">After spoofing an internal IT number, conduct an inventory of the company’s assets. Explain that the company has an upcoming audit, and you need to ensure that its information is correct. Start by asking when the person started at the company and how they like it. Ask about their schedule. Then ask the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there any logos or numbers on the back of their badge?</li>
<li>Do they use a laptop or desktop?</li>
<li>What kind of phone is on the desk?</li>
<li>What are the make and model of their computer?</li>
<li>Which operating system do they use?</li>
<li>Which service pack and version is used?</li>
<li>What do they use as a mail client?</li>
<li>Which browsers do they use?</li>
<li>Can they access wireless networks?</li>
<li>Which networks?</li>
<li>Which antivirus do they have installed?</li>
<li>Are any websites blocked?</li>
</ul>
<p>Make note of any blocked websites, and then tell them that you are deploying a security policy. If they do not know of any websites being blocked, ask them to go to Facebook and eBay. You will tell the user to go to <em>&lt;your phishing site here&gt;.</em> To end the call, receive an “urgent email” and disconnect.</p>
<p>You can ask these same questions using a few other pretexts as well. For example, try posing as a confused fellow employee, calling an internal number, and asking the target if they can access a few sites and resources; tell them you cannot access a certain site and then ask if they can. Alternatively, call the company as if you were a person interested in working for it. Leverage your “community college classes” to segue into asking about IT.</p>
<h2 id="h1-500983b04-0003"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_199" title="199"/>Transparency Survey</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Call an employee of the company from an internal number to conduct a 10-question employee transparency survey. Say that the survey’s focus is to see how transparent the company is and how much employees know about the business. Ask the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Do they use a VPN?</li>
<li>What is their work schedule?</li>
<li>When is payday?</li>
<li>How long have they worked at the target company?</li>
<li>Which operating system, browser, and mail client are used?</li>
<li>Do they have a cafeteria?</li>
<li>Who does pest control?</li>
<li>Who are the janitors?</li>
<li>What kind of antivirus do they use?</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, attempt to get them to browse to your phishing website. Then thank them and hang up abruptly.</p>

- en: The first step in most hacking is *reconnaissance*, or *recon*. In a military
    operation, recon involves surveying enemy territory or observing a target. In
    the hacking world, attackers perform recon online. They gather information about
    companies, networks, and individuals using regular search engines (like Google),
    social media platforms, and specialized tools. Then they use the information to
    plan the next stage of a hack.

    or words that make your search results more precise. You’re probably familiar
    with some basic search operators already. For example, putting quotation marks

    in the phrase. Using the operators *AND* and *OR* can help you find pages with
    both words (*3D* AND *printer*) or either word (*coding* OR *cyber*).

    tools. For example, the operator `ext:` searches for specific *file extensions*,
    or the filename endings for different types of files. Examples include *docx*
    for Microsoft Word documents, *txt* for plaintext, *pdf* for PDF files, *xlsx*
    for Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, and so on. The operator `site:` searches for
    results on specific sites; you might search for `site:nostarch.com` or `site:``yourcompany.com`.

    camera a company purchased last year.

It was surrounded only by a rough wooden
fence, nothing like the high stone walls of Symbol, and the main entrance seemed to be unguarded.
Laurie was walking through the gates, when—</p><p>“Excuse me, dear! Hello, on your left.” An elderly lady was sitting in the shade
just inside. She held a large book on her lap. Her name tag read <span class="emphasis"><em>Jane Hecate, Border
Security</em></span>.</p><p>“Oh! I didn’t see you there,” said Laurie.</p><p>“That’s all right, dear. But before you come in I have to make sure you are on the
List.”</p><p>Laurie had played this game before. “My name is Eponymous Bach, and my password
is—”</p><p>“Hold on, dear, hold on! One thing at a time. First let’s look up your
name.” She opened the heavy book and started to scan the pages with her finger, letter by
letter.</p><p>“E . . . E . . . Ah, E! Here we go.”</p><p>It was painfully slow.</p><p>“P . . . P . . . E-P! . . . E-P-O . . . E-P-O . . . no.”</p><p>Jane closed the book with a thump.</p><p>“Sorry, not on the List.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You’re not on the List, dear. There are Es, and E-Ps, but there are no names that
start with E-P-O. If the <span class="emphasis"><em>start</em></span> of your name isn’t on the List,
there’s no reason to keep looking for the <span class="emphasis"><em>rest</em></span> of it, now is there?
It’s only logical.”</p><p>“But her—<span class="emphasis"><em>my</em></span> name must be on the List! She’s a
great—I mean, I am—” Laurie sputtered.</p><p>“Are you a foreigner? I bet your name is spelled differently where you come from. That
can happen, especially with foreigners. Why don’t we try again?”</p><p>Maybe she did have an account after all. “Is it under ‘Laurie
Ipsum’?”</p><p>“Let me see.” <span class="emphasis"><em>Fllliiiip!</em></span> “L . . . L . . . L! A . . . U
. . . R . . . I . . . Nope. Not here, but I’m sure we’ll find it.”</p><p>“It could be spelled Laur<span class="emphasis"><em>en</em></span> Ipsum.”</p><p>“L . . . A . . . U . . . R . . . E . . . No, not that way either.” “Uh, Hugh
. . . Rustic?”</p><p>“H . . . H . . . H! H-U-G-H R-U-S-T-I-C. Ah, <span class="emphasis"><em>there</em></span> you
are.”</p><p>“Great!”</p><p>“I’m so glad we could find you!” Jane said. “Your name is spelled
quite a few different ways, isn’t it?”</p><p>“Yeah, I guess it is. Thanks!” Laurie turned to go inside.</p><p>Jane held her back with a surprisingly strong grip.</p><p>“Your <span class="emphasis"><em>password</em></span>, dear?”</p><p>“Oh! Is it ‘Rustic’?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Turtle?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Algorithm?”</p><p>“A . . . L . . . No.”</p><p>“Good Enough?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Laurie was stumped. “Now what?” she whispered to Xor. “She doesn’t
care if I try every word in the dictionary. But we’ll be here all month!”</p><p>“I have an idea,” Xor whispered back. “Try
‘Abstraction.’”</p><p>“What is that? I don’t even—”</p><p>“My third cousin is a Thesaurus. Trust me!”</p><p>“Is it Ab-stract-tion?” Laurie asked Jane.</p><p>“A . . . B . . . S . . . No, dear.”</p><p>“‘Trust me,’ huh?” Laurie said to Xor.</p><p>“Come to think of it, I never liked that cousin.”</p><p>“Hey . . . did you notice something?”</p><p>“Is it dinner time already?” Xor asked hopefully.</p><p>“No! When I said ‘Turtle,’ she said no right away,” Laurie
said.</p><p>“So? It’s not the password,” Xor said.</p><p>“But when I said ‘Algorithm,’ she took longer to say no. And with
Abstraction, she took a little longer than that, moving her finger over the page . . .” Laurie
cleared her throat and spoke to Jane. “Is the password, um, About?”</p><p>“A . . . B . . . O . . . No.”</p><p>“See?” she whispered.</p><p>“Okay, but what does it mean?”</p><p>“Maybe it means the real password starts with AB! So if we keep guessing AB words . .
.”</p><p>Letter by letter they cracked Rustic’s password. It was difficult for Laurie to think of
words that started with the right letters. She did not know many of the words Xor told her to try,
but he swore they were real, on the honor of Thesauruses everywhere. She knew they were getting
warmer because Jane would take longer and longer to say no.</p><p>“Abend!”</p><p>“A . . . B . . . E . . . No,” Jane replied.</p><p>“Abdicate!”</p><p>“A . . . B . . . D . . . No.”</p><p>“Abrogate!”</p><p>“A . . . B . . . R . . . O . . . No.”</p><p>“It starts with ABR!” Laurie whispered to Xor. “Abrupt!”</p><p>“A . . . B . . . R . . . U . . . No.”</p><p>“Abraid!”</p><p>“A . . . B . . . R . . . A . . . I . . . No.”</p><p>“We’re getting close,” Xor said in her ear. “What starts with
ABRA?”</p><p>“Abracadabra?” Laurie said out loud.</p><p>“A-B-R-A-C-A-D-A-B-R-A!” said Jane. “That’s the password, right as
rain. Welcome to Probability!”</p></div></body></html>

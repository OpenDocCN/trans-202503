<p class="TNI1">There are so many people who have helped make this book a reality in small and large ways. Throughout my career, I’ve had mentors who have guided me and pushed me to become better at my craft. There’s nothing more rewarding than working with someone who is smarter than you are, so go find people who make you feel stupid in comparison. Try to glean anything you can from them. Look at their code, ask dumb questions, and you’ll improve.</p>
<p class="TX">I’d like to thank everyone who has supported me in my Nandland pursuits—those who have liked, commented, or subscribed to videos on my YouTube channel; purchased a Go Board; or supported my Patreon. You’ve built up my confidence and helped me stay motivated to keep cranking out FPGA content for years and years.</p>
<p class="TX">I never imagined that writing a book would be as lengthy a process as it turned out to be. Many thanks to my editor, Nathan Heidelberger, who has had the biggest impact on the quality of this book. Nathan doesn’t have an engineering background, but he was able to give me valuable feedback from an outsider’s perspective when concepts were unclear. Similarly, I’m grateful to my technical reviewer, Mike D. Smith, a coworker and friend from my BAE Systems days. His attention to the technical explanations ensured that this book would be accessible and, equally importantly, accurate.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page xviii. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_xviii" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Finally, I’d like to thank my family for allowing me the (significant) time required to write this book. Many nights and weekends have been impacted, so to my wife, Christine, I would like to say thank you for always being supportive and encouraging. I couldn’t have done this without your help.</p>

    comes to interfacing with embedded systems, we reach for a few common pinouts
    often. We’ve gathered them here for your referencing pleasure.

- en: SPI flash is normally available in 8- and 16-pin versions. [Figure B-1](#figureB-1)
    shows an eight-pin *SOIC* (300mil width, 600mil width) and eight-pin *WSON*. We
    covered the details of these packages in Chapter 3\. Note that * in the pin names
    in the figures refers to an *active-low* signal.

- en: Arm JTAG uses a large 20-pin header (see [Figure B-3](#figureB-3)). This header
    is rarely found in real products, but development boards commonly use it. You
    will also normally find this pinout on JTAG debug adapters, such as SEGGER J-Link
    and OpenOCD devices.

    voltage, **RDY* indicates the readiness of the Nexus debugging interface, and
    *JCOMP* is used to enable the TAP controller. Some pins aren’t used depending
    on the specific chip; pin 8 is No Connect (NC) on MPC55xx and MPC56xx boards.'

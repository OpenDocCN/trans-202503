<p class="ch-sub">Soldering is a simple skill, but if you’ve never done it before you’ll need some guidance. This appendix provides a quick introduction to soldering components to a circuit board.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_220"/>Soldering is the process of joining two pieces of metal by melting <em>solder</em>, a metal alloy usually made of tin and lead. The solder liquefies, surrounds the two pieces of metal, and solidifies again, forming a strong electrical and mechanical connection. This is a popular method of making connections between electrical components, wires, and circuit boards.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev153"><strong>SOLDERING TOOLS</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">You’ll need the following tools for soldering:</p>
<ul>
<li class="noindent">Soldering iron</li>
<li class="noindent">Solder (For electronics, not plumbing. Use either lead-free or leaded.)</li>
<li class="noindent">Something to solder to, such as a printed circuit board</li>
<li class="noindent">Wire cutters</li>
<li class="noindent">Parts to solder (These would be wires or electrical components. If this is your first time, I’d recommend soldering wires since they are cheaper.)</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">You’ll need a clear workspace and somewhere heat-proof to rest the iron when you’re not using it—you can get soldering iron stands for this purpose. It can also be useful to get a set of Helping Hands to hold your pieces in place while you solder. Beyond these tools, I recommend keeping a wet sponge nearby to periodically clean the tip of the iron.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev154"><strong>HOW TO SOLDER IN SIX STEPS</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">On the printed circuit board (PCB) are <em>pads</em>, which are little bits of exposed metal, usually around a hole. This hole is where you’d insert a lead or wire from your component to solder in place.</p>
<p class="indent">Before soldering, gather your parts and PCB and position them on a flat surface so they’re steady. We’ll use a resistor as our example. Follow these steps, using <a href="appendix.xhtml#appfig1">Figure A-1</a> as a visual guide.</p>
<ol>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list">Insert the lead from your component into the hole in the pad. Use the tip of your soldering iron to heat <em>both</em> the pad and the lead sticking through.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list">Wait a few seconds for everything to heat up.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list">Add solder to the hot joint using a poking motion.</p>

<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE A-1:</strong> Soldering a component to a PCB</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list">Stop adding solder when you have a nice mound of solder around the lead that covers the pad without touching other pads—something like <a href="appendix.xhtml#appfig2">Figure A-2</a>.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list">Leave the iron on the joint for a couple of seconds after you stop adding solder. This ensures that the solder completely flows into the joint. Then remove the iron and let the solder cool.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list">Once the solder is completely cool, trim the excess lead just above the solder and inspect your work.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">After soldering each joint, ensure that it is shiny and smooth, as shown in <a href="appendix.xhtml#appfig2">Figure A-2</a>.</p>

<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE A-2:</strong> A joint with just the right amount of solder</p>
<p class="indent">There shouldn’t be too much or too little solder. It should look like a little volcano of solder around the wire.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev155"><strong>KEEPING THE IRON’S TIP CLEAN</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">After you solder each connection, be sure to keep your iron’s tip clean. This improves heat transfer into the connection and makes soldering much easier. <a href="appendix.xhtml#appfig3">Figure A-3</a> shows an example of a relatively clean solder tip.</p>
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_222"/><a id="appfig3"/><img src="../images/f0222-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE A-3:</strong> Using a clean tip makes soldering much easier.</p>
<p class="indent">When the iron is hot, periodically wipe off the tip with a wet sponge or wet paper towel, and then reapply a little solder to make it shine!</p>

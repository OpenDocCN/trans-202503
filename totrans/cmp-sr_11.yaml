    and read them from the comfort of your computer. It works just like borrowing
    a regular library book: the book is loaned for a certain amount of time, and if
    a book is already checked out, you have to wait for it to be returned. One big
    advantage is that OverDrive automatically returns the book for you, so there’s
    no chance of paying any late fees! To use the OverDrive app, you need to be a
    member of a library that has signed up for OverDrive. With more than 30,000 libraries
    that use OverDrive in more than 40 countries, there’s a good chance you’ll find
    one near you.'

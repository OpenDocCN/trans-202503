<h2 class="h2p" id="ch00"><a id="page_xix"/><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></h2>
<p class="noindent">Let me tell you a little about who I think you are: You’re a web professional who’s been hand-coding HTML and CSS for a few years; you’re pretty comfortable with creating complex layouts, and you know not only your <code>div</code> from your <code>span</code> but also your <code>bold</code> from your <code>strong</code>; you’ve read a little about CSS3 and may even have started experimenting with some of its more decorative features like rounded corners, but you want to gain a deeper understanding of the fundamentals.</p>
<p class="indent"><em>The Book of CSS3</em> helps you leverage the excellent knowledge you have of CSS2.1 in order to make learning CSS3 easier. I won’t explain the fundamentals of CSS (except for the occasional reminder), as I assume you know them already. I won’t talk you through step-by-step demonstrations of using CSS to make a listed navigation or an image gallery, because I assume you can apply the examples in this book to anything you want to build on your own.</p>
<p class="indent">I’ll introduce you to what you can do with CSS3 now and show you what you’ll be able to do with it in the future. At the same time, I’ll take the dense technical language of the CSS3 specification and translate it into language that’s plain and practical.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_xx"/>In short, I hope to give you some new tools for your toolkit that will let you make even cooler stuff.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00leve1sec1"><strong>The Scope of This Book</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">CSS can be used across many types of media; in fact, almost any device that can display HTML or XML can also display CSS rules, though sometimes in a limited form. CSS3 has modules devoted exclusively to paged media, such as PDF or printed materials, and it supports braille, handheld mobile devices (that is, cell phones rather than smartphones), teletypes, and televisions. The range and breadth of possibilities is so vast that I can’t possibly cover them all.</p>
<p class="indent">This book focuses on CSS for the computer screen. All of the demonstrations are written for (and tested in) the most common desktop browsers, and are optimized for users of desktop and laptop computers. Almost all of the new CSS features covered in this book should work whether you’re developing for smartphones, tablets, or other devices, but I can’t guarantee that everything will display exactly as shown in the examples you’ll find here.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00leve1sec2"><strong>Chapter by Chapter</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Here’s a brief idea of what will be covered in this book:</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong><a href="ch01.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a></strong> introduces CSS3, explains its history, and looks at the W3C standardization process. It also describes the syntax I use for my demonstration code.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong><a href="ch02.html#ch02">Chapter 2</a></strong> covers media queries, the technology that’s critical to the adaptive and responsive web design methods.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong><a href="ch03.html#ch03">Chapters 3</a> and <a href="ch04.html#ch04">4</a></strong> introduce new selectors: attribute selectors in <a href="ch03.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a> and pseudo-classes in <a href="ch04.html#ch04">Chapter 4</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong><a href="ch05.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a></strong> shows how to choose custom web fonts and properties that give you more control over font rendering.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong><a href="ch06.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a></strong> continues the typographic theme, with coverage of a new property for adding shadows to text and controlling the way blocks of text are displayed.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong><a href="ch07.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a></strong> is also about text, this time explaining how you can flow it across multiple columns.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong><a href="ch08.html#ch08">Chapters 8</a> and <a href="ch09.html#ch09">9</a></strong> cover the Background and Borders Module, including extensions to existing background properties and brand-new ways to add decorative effects to element borders.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong><a href="ch10.html#ch10">Chapter 10</a></strong> explains how to use opacity and transparency, and introduces some new color models.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><a id="page_xxi"/><strong><a href="ch11.html#ch11">Chapter 11</a></strong> introduces CSS gradients, a method of transitioning between two or more colors to make unique background decorations.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong><a href="ch12.html#ch12">Chapters 12</a> and <a href="ch13.html#ch13">13</a></strong> show how to visually transform elements, changing their appearance in two and three dimensions.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong><a href="ch14.html#ch14">Chapter 14</a></strong> introduces animation, such as transitional changes between two values and complex timed animations.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong><a href="ch15.html#ch15">Chapter 15</a></strong> covers Flexbox, a new way of laying out elements based on the space available.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong><a href="ch16.html#ch16">Chapter 16</a></strong> is also about page layout, covering new value units and how to perform dimension calculations and size elements based on their contents.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong><a href="ch17.html#ch17">Chapter 17</a></strong> is the last of the layout chapters, introducing the new CSS Grid Layout Module.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong><a href="ch18.html#ch18">Chapter 18</a></strong> looks at visual effects, such as blending an element’s background layers or blending one element with another, using graphical filters, and how to clip an element using simple shapes.</p>
<p class="noindent1"><strong><a href="ch19.html#ch19">Chapter 19</a></strong> closes the book with a look to the (possible) future of CSS: new properties and features that are currently fairly experimental but may become fully implemented across browsers at a later date.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00leve1sec3"><strong>The Appendices and Further Resources</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">There are two appendices at the end of the book. The first is a quick reference to the browser support of the CSS features discussed in this book, and the second is a list of online resources, useful tools, and interesting demonstrations.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, on the website for this book at <em><a href="http://www.thebookofcss3.com/">http://www.thebookofcss3.com/</a></em> you’ll find up-to-date versions of both appendices and all examples and demonstrations used in this book. And if I’ve made any mistakes, you’ll find a full list of errata there, too.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to the accompanying website, you’ll find more of my writing about CSS3 (and other emerging web technologies) at my blog, Broken Links (<em><a href="http://www.broken-links.com/">http://www.broken-links.com/</a></em>). Feel free to comment or get in touch with me through either of these websites.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00leve1sec4"><strong>Introduction to the Second Edition</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">I began work on the first edition of this book in 2010. It’s been only four years, but how the landscape has changed in that time! In 2010, the iPad had been out for only a few months, Android had yet to explode, and looking at visitor statistics for my own website, visits from all mobile devices accounted for 11.6 percent of sessions—compare that to the 54.8 percent count at the time of this writing.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_xxii"/>Since publication of the first edition of this book, we’ve seen four major versions of Safari and three of Internet Explorer. Firefox has become an auto-updating “evergreen” browser, Chrome has switched from the Web-Kit engine to its own Blink, and Opera has discontinued work on its own Presto engine to also use Blink.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, the rise of preprocessors such as Sass and LESS has brought the power of programming languages into our stylesheets and dramatically changed the way we write CSS. Most professional developers now use a preprocessor as a core component of the website authoring tool set.</p>
<p class="indent">Many CSS specifications have changed since the first edition, too. Some have been discontinued, and many more have been created. And the CSS3 of 2010 had many more cross-browser implementation differences, but the differences are much fewer today as browser vendors have placed more importance on adhering to standards.</p>
<p class="indent">In other words, this second edition is not simply a light edit of the first; every chapter has been fully revised to reflect changes to the specification and to remove outdated implementation information and experimental properties not in the specification. Certain chapters (those on media queries, Flexbox, grids, and the future of CSS in particular) are almost entirely new, and I’ve added new chapters on values and sizing as well as blend modes, filter effects, and masking.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s to the next four years of change.</p>

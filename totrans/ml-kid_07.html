<span class="ChapterTitle">Finding an Object in a Picture</span>
</h1>
</header>
<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="OpenerCap"><img src="Images/Alphabet-I.png" alt="Alphabet-I" class="dropcap"/></span>n earlier chapters, you learned that you can train an ML system so that if you give it a picture, it can recognize the object in that picture. That’s useful when the whole picture is of something that you’re interested in, as it was when you made the Rock, Paper, Scissors game in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 4">Chapter 4</span>. For that game, your hand filled the photo. But sometimes we want the computer to learn to find something that’s only a small part of a much bigger <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="130" id="Page_130"/>picture. In this chapter, you’ll see how to break up a complex job into separate simpler parts and then use ML for each part. </p>
<p>For example, imagine that you want to use ML to find where the tree is in <a id="figureanchor9-1" href="#figure9-1">Figure 9-1</a>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Images/f09001.png" alt="f09001"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure9-1" href="#figureanchor9-1">Figure 9-1:</a> Where is the tree? </p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The basic idea is that you train an ML model to recognize pictures of trees, in the same way that you trained it to recognize pictures of certain animals in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 3">Chapter 3</span>. Then, you chop up this new photo into smaller pieces and use that ML model to check which piece looks like a picture of a tree.</p>
<p>For example, the top-left piece of <a href="#figure9-1">Figure 9-1</a> is shown in <a id="figureanchor9-2" href="#figure9-2">Figure 9-2</a>. The ML model wouldn’t recognize this picture as a tree, so we can say that the tree isn’t in the top left of the picture.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Images/f09002.png" alt="f09002"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure9-2" href="#figureanchor9-2">Figure 9-2:</a> Top left of <a href="#figure9-1">Figure 9-1</a></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="131" id="Page_131"/>Or, we could try the bottom-right piece shown in <a id="figureanchor9-3" href="#figure9-3">Figure 9-3</a>. The ML model wouldn’t recognize this picture as a tree either, so we can say that the tree isn’t in the bottom right of the picture.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Images/f09003.png" alt="f09003"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure9-3" href="#figureanchor9-3">Figure 9-3:</a> Bottom right of <a href="#figure9-1">Figure 9-1</a></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We keep going until we try testing a picture like <a id="figureanchor9-4" href="#figure9-4">Figure 9-4</a>. When we get a piece that the ML model has high confidence looks like a picture of a tree, we know that we’ve found the location of the tree.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Images/f09004.png" alt="f09004"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure9-4" href="#figureanchor9-4">Figure 9-4:</a> Bottom left of <a href="#figure9-1">Figure 9-1</a></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A good way to think of it is that you’re breaking the picture up into tiles and testing each tile separately. In this chapter, you’ll see for yourself how this method works as you train an ML model to find where something is in randomly generated scenes.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">For this chapter, we’ll use a Scratch project that chooses a random backdrop and then randomly distributes a dozen sprites around the Stage. One of the sprites is a duck. The aim of this project is to find the duck only by looking at the Stage, without cheating by using the coordinates of the sprite (see <a id="figureanchor9-5" href="#figure9-5">Figure 9-5</a>).</p>

<p>These numbers give us a more meaningful way of describing the performance of the ML model. </p>
<p>My model, which was trained with only a small number of examples, seems to be very precise (when it recognizes a duck, it is always correct). However, it misses things sometimes.</p>
<p>We describe a precise model that sometimes misses things as <em>favoring precision over recall</em>. This is a good approach for projects where it is important not to falsely recognize things.</p>
<p>For projects where it is more important to not miss anything, and where it is okay to make the occasional mistake, you would aim to train ML models in a way that <em>favors recall over precision</em> instead.</p>
<p>How is your project performing?</p>
<h2 id="h1-500563c09-0003">Real-World Applications for Complex Image Recognition Systems</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">You might have trained an image recognition ML model like this before. Have you ever been asked by a website to prove that you’re a human by clicking pictures of street signs as in <a id="figureanchor9-25" href="#figure9-25">Figure 9-25</a>? Or bicycles? Or taxis?</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" title="146" id="Page_146"/><figure>
<img src="Images/f09025.png" alt="f09025"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure9-25" href="#figureanchor9-25">Figure 9-25:</a> Helping to train an ML model </p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Hopefully you can see how this kind of image recognition application, known as a <em>CAPTCHA</em><em/>, would be a great way to collect a large number of training examples for an image recognition system that can find different things on the street. Do you think this would be useful in the development of self-driving cars?</p>
<p>The basic idea here is described in the chapter’s introduction. If we want to find something small in a larger picture, we chop the picture up into smaller tiles and test each tile individually with an ML model trained to recognize pictures of that object.</p>
<p>You probably have a feel for the sorts of challenges of this technique from training it yourself. For example, one of the biggest problems is deciding what size tiles to use. Remember the example of finding the tree in <a href="#figure9-1">Figure 9-1</a>?</p>
<p>If you make your tiles too small, you might only ever see a small section of the object you’re trying to find and never recognize it. For example, your ML model might not recognize <a id="figureanchor9-26" href="#figure9-26">Figure 9-26</a> as a tree. </p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" title="147" id="Page_147"/><figure>
<img src="Images/f09026.png" alt="f09026"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure9-26" href="#figureanchor9-26">Figure 9-26:</a> A tile that includes only part of the tree </p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>On the other hand, if you make your tiles too big, as in <a id="figureanchor9-27" href="#figure9-27">Figure 9-27</a>, you still have the problem of there being too much in the picture that <em>isn’t</em> the tree, which will challenge an ML model trained to recognize pictures of trees. </p>
<figure>
<img src="Images/f09027.png" alt="f09027"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure9-27" href="#figureanchor9-27">Figure 9-27:</a> A tile that is too large to focus on the tree</p></figcaption>

<p>If you know the likely size of the object you’re looking for in the picture, you can make a sensible estimate for the right tile size to use. Some systems even ask users to specify the tile size to use.</p>
<p>If neither of these solutions is an option, you can try a wide variety of tile sizes and use the result that gives your model the highest confidence, as shown in <a id="figureanchor9-28" href="#figure9-28">Figure 9-28</a>.</p>
<p>Even if you get the grid size right, the object you’re looking for won’t always fit neatly in the middle of a tile (as you probably noticed with the duck). </p>

<p>To improve your chance of finding a tile with the object you want in the middle, you also need to try different starting positions. </p>
<p>Systems that use a combination of these techniques can be very effective. For example, in 2015, during a state of emergency caused by a drought in California, an ML model was used to find lawns, swimming pools, and other features that affect water usage. </p>
<p>Cutting the satellite images for the whole state into tiles, just as you’ve done in your project, meant each tile could be individually classified. The main difference was that the California ML model was trained to recognize not just one thing, but several different things, that impact water usage. (You saw in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 3">Chapter 3</span> how you can train an ML model to recognize pictures of different objects.) Combining image recognition with a map meant California officials could quickly understand the impact of water usage across the state. </p>
<p>California is a huge state, and to manually perform such a census or survey would have taken a long time. ML was a fast and efficient way to come up with a useful estimate, and in times of emergency, speed and efficiency are very important. </p>
<p>ML image recognition techniques are also regularly used in businesses. For example, drones can take high-resolution photos while flying over buildings, roofs, bridges, solar panels, pipes, and much more. These photos are then chopped into tiles and tested by an ML model trained to recognize signs of damage or poor maintenance and repair. Automated image recognition systems based on the same principles as this chapter’s project are used in a variety of fields, such as civil engineering (for inspecting bridges and buildings), agriculture (for recognizing healthy or diseased plants and crops), or even public safety (such as in Australia, where ML is used in lifesaver drones that can recognize sharks from the air).</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">In this chapter, you trained an ML model to recognize objects that are part of a larger scene. This is the most complicated project you’ve done so far, but hopefully you now have a good understanding of how complex image recognition systems are built. You learned some of the challenges of training such systems, like knowing how to break up the complex task into simpler tasks (such as by choosing the correct tile size), and you got some tips for solving them. You also saw some real-world applications for these kinds of complex ML systems and examples of the fields where they’re used.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we’ll look at another common use of ML: smart assistants.</p>

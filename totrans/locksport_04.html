<div class="image1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/03fig00.jpg"/></div>
<p class="noindent">To be able to pick or impression a lock successfully, first you have to understand how it works. To that end, in this chapter we’ll define the common terms for the parts of a lock and then explore a variety of locking mechanisms and how they operate.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev9">Elements of a Lock</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this section, we’ll discuss the most common parts you’ll find on locks. Even if you’re pretty comfortable with this topic, we still suggest perusing it. People tend to use a lot of lock-related terms interchangeably, but they have subtle differences. Having a shared vocabulary will help you follow along with the rest of the book.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec18"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_24"/><em>The Housing or Cylinder</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s start with the most visible part of any lock: the <em>housing</em>, or the body of the lock. The term <em>cylinder</em> is also commonly used to refer to the housing or to the entire lock including the housing. As <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig1">Figure 3-1</a> shows, on a padlock you can see the entire housing, whereas only the face of the housing is visible on an installed door-mounted rim cylinder, like a deadbolt.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig1" src="../images/03fig01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-1: The housing of a padlock (left) and deadbolt (right)</em></p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec19"><em>The Shackle or Bolt</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">The name of the piece used to secure the lock differs depending on the lock’s type. On a padlock it’s typically a U-shaped part, called a <em>shackle</em> or a <em>shank</em> (<a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig2">Figure 3-2</a>).</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig2" src="../images/03fig02.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-2: A padlock’s shackle</em></p>
<p class="indent">On a door lock or safe lock, this part juts out from the side of the door and into the door frame or safe (as shown in <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig3">Figure 3-3</a>) and is known as a <em>bolt</em>.</p>
<div class="imagec"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_25"/><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig3" src="../images/03fig03.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-3: A safe lock bolt</em></p>
<p class="indent">The bolt isn’t always built directly into a lock. Sometimes it’s part of the hardware mounted to the door (known as the <em>lockset</em>) and then connected to the lock cylinder by a cam or tailpiece, described later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="indent">In lockpicking competitions with padlocks or safe locks, releasing the shackle or retracting the bolt constitutes an <em>open</em>—a successfully picked lock. Competitions using Euro profile cylinders typically don’t include the bolt, so competitors achieve an open by rotating the plug, described next.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec20"><em>The Plug</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">The <em>plug</em> is a round, cylindrical piece of metal that rotates when the correct key is inserted and turned (<a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig4">Figure 3-4</a>). Only the face of the plug is visible when the lock is assembled. As we’ll discuss shortly, lock mechanisms that commonly use plugs include pin tumblers, wafers, and dimples. Inside a lock, the plug is surrounded by a metal sleeve called a <em>shell</em>.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>The term</em> shell <em>can refer to different things for different locks. In Euro profile cylinders, for instance, the <em>shell</em> is just the actual housing of the lock. In some designs, such as KIK cylinders mounted inside a padlock, the shell is a separate part altogether</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig4" src="../images/03fig04.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-4: A plug removed from a KIK cylinder</em></p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec21"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_26"/><em>The Core</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">You’ll often hear people refer to a lock’s plug as its <em>core</em>, but that isn’t exactly right. On most types of locks, the plug and the core aren’t distinct parts. However, on interchangeable core locks like SFICs, the core is the figure-eight-shaped part of the lock that fits into the housing, and the plug, in turn, fits into the core (see <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig5">Figure 3-5</a>). ICs contain most of the lock’s inner workings, including the pins and springs.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig5" src="../images/03fig05.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-5: An SFIC core in a padlock</em></p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec22"><em>The Keyway</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">The <em>keyway</em> of a lock is the slot cut into the plug where you insert a key or picking tools. Keyways vary in size and shape depending on the lock’s brand and model. A typical keyway, originally created by the Schlage lock company, is shown in <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig6">Figure 3-6</a>.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig6" src="../images/03fig06.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-6: A typical keyway</em></p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_27"/>As a security feature, some keyways are designed to be particularly tight or oddly shaped to limit the space available for picking tools. For example, the keyway in the IKON lock shown in <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig7">Figure 3-7</a> is off-center, or <em>paracentric</em>. We’ll talk more about keyways in <a href="ch4.xhtml">Chapters 4</a>, <a href="ch6.xhtml">6</a>, and <a href="ch7.xhtml">7</a>.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig7" src="../images/03fig07.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-7: A paracentric keyway</em></p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec23"><em>Pins, Wafers, Discs, and Levers</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">Keyed locks rely on a series of metal pieces that align with the key to open the lock. These metal pieces can be <em>pins</em>, small cylinders that come to a point; <em>wafers</em>, flat, oblong plates with a hole in the center; <em>discs</em>, round plates with a hole in the center and a notch on the edge; or <em>levers</em>, long, pivoting arms (see <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig8">Figure 3-8</a> for some examples). Regardless of the exact mechanism, these are the parts you manipulate with your picking tool.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig8" src="../images/03fig08.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-8: An assortment of key and driver pins (a), wafers (b), discs (c), and levers (d)</em></p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec24"><em>Springs</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">Most locks contain <em>springs</em> to keep the pins, levers, or wafers in place. In pin tumbler and dimple locks, each pin stack has a small spring that presses the pins up or down, depending on the lock’s orientation (see <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig9">Figure 3-9</a>). <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_28"/>Similarly, wafer locks use springs to position wafers, and lever locks use larger springs to tension the levers.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig9" src="../images/03fig09.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-9: A variety of pin tumbler springs</em></p>
<p class="indent">Even locks that don’t use springs as part of the locking mechanism often contain them for other purposes. Safe locks can have a springy, bent metal washer to tension the wheel pack (see the later section “The Wheel Pack and Drive Cam”). Padlocks, regardless of the locking mechanism, often have springs to pop open the shackle once it’s unlocked. Because of all these springs, parts can easily go flying if you’re taking apart a lock for the first time! We’ll cover how to avoid that in <a href="ch5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec25"><em>The Bible</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">The <em>bible</em> contains chambers that hold the springs and driver pins in a pin tumbler lock. On a KIK or Euro profile cylinder, the bible protrudes above or below the plug, as shown in <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig10">Figure 3-10</a>. Although technically part of the housing, the term <em>bible</em> gets used enough to warrant mention.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig10" src="../images/03fig10.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-10: The bible of a KIK cylinder</em></p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec26"><em>The Wheel Pack and Drive Cam</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">Combination locks, such as those found on safes, typically don’t use keys. These locks don’t have pins, keyways, plugs, or even cores. Instead, inside the housing sits a <em>wheel pack</em> containing one wheel for each number in the combination. (Combination lock competitions use three-wheel locks <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_29"/>exclusively.) On top of the wheel pack is the <em>drive cam</em>, which is responsible for spinning the wheels when someone turns the dial and for retracting the bolt (see <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig11">Figure 3-11</a>).</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig11" src="../images/03fig11.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-11: The wheel pack and drive cam in a safe lock</em></p>
<p class="indent">Each wheel has a notch, called a <em>gate</em>. When the gates of all the wheels align with the gate of the drive cam, a metal bar called the <em>fence</em> drops into the groove they create, allowing the bolt to be retracted and the lock to be opened. We’ll talk more about this mechanism in “Combination Locks” on <a href="ch3.xhtml#sec30">page 38</a>.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>Some combination locks have a key to change the combination or bypass it entirely (such as a manager key for hotel safes). Some safes also require a key</em> and <em>a combination—two-factor authentication for the physical world</em>.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec27"><em>Cams, Tails, Latches, and Ball Bearings</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">In most locks, the key (and even the plug) doesn’t directly interact with the bolt or shackle. Instead, rotating the plug moves a small element on the lock, which is what actually moves the bolt or releases the shackle. This element’s name depends on the lock.</p>
<p class="indent">On a Euro profile cylinder or mortise cylinder, it’s called a <em>cam</em>. On a double-sided Euro profile cylinder, the cam is in the middle of the lock (as shown in <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig12">Figure 3-12</a>), while on a mortise, the cam is on the back.</p>
<div class="imagec"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_30"/><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig12" src="../images/03fig12.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-12: The cam on a Euro profile cylinder</em></p>
<p class="indent">On rim and KIK cylinders, this mechanism is called a <em>tail</em> or <em>tailpiece</em>, which is a long, flat piece of metal mounted to the back (see <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig13">Figure 3-13</a>).</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig13" src="../images/03fig13.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-13: The tail of a rim cylinder</em></p>
<p class="indent">Padlocks are typically a little different. Cheaper padlocks have one or two wedge-shaped, spring-loaded latches that snap into notches on the shackle to lock the padlock, and then retract when the plug is turned to unlock it. Instead of latches, higher-end padlocks use <em>ball bearings</em> that mate with half-circle cuts on the shackle. <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig14">Figure 3-14</a> highlights the difference. The balls roll into the housing when the correct key is used, releasing the shackle.</p>
<div class="imagec"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_31"/><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig14" src="../images/03fig14.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-14: A padlock that uses ball bearings to secure the shackle (left) and one that uses latches (right)</em></p>
<p class="indent">Padlocks with ball bearings are typically more secure. The latches’ wedge-like shape lends itself to <em>shimming attacks</em>, in which a thin piece of metal is slipped next to the shackle and into the housing in order to depress and release the latch. This isn’t possible with the ball bearing mechanism.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev10">Locking Mechanisms</h3>
<p class="noindent">A wide variety of locking mechanisms are used throughout the world. Certain types have a reputation for being more secure, but generally there are secure and insecure examples of every type of lock. In this section, we’ll look at the most widespread locking mechanisms: pin-based locks, wafer locks, combination locks, lever locks, warded locks, and disc detainer locks.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec28"><em>Pin-Based Locks</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">Several styles of locks use pins for their locking mechanism, including pin tumbler, dimple, and tubular locks. We’ll start with pin tumblers, arguably the most common type of lock in the world.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>Pin Tumbler Locks</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">You probably use several pin tumbler locks almost every day, as the vast majority of homes and businesses throughout the world rely on them. While the mechanism known today as a <em>pin tumbler</em> has been around since the mid-1800s, more primitive versions have existed for thousands of years.</p>
<p class="indent">The plug of a pin tumbler lock has a series of holes that align with holes in the lock’s bible. Each hole contains two or more pins and a spring. The <em>key pin</em> touches the surface of a key inserted into the plug’s keyway and often has a conical tip. The <em>driver pin</em> sits between the key pin and the spring and is flat on both ends. Usually, the driver pins are all the same length, while the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_32"/>key pins vary in length to match the different cut depths on a key. Together these pins and springs make up one <em>pin stack</em>, as shown in <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig15">Figure 3-15</a>.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig15" src="../images/03fig15.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-15: The pin stack</em></p>
<p class="indent">When a key is inserted, if it’s cut to the correct height for the pin stack’s position, the key pin will be flush with the edge of the plug, and the driver pin and spring will be entirely inside the bible. This point where the plug and the bible meet is called the <em>shear line</em>. <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig16">Figure 3-16</a> shows the cross section of a single pin stack aligned with the shear line; notice how the key pin (blue) ends at the very edge of the plug (green), while the driver pin (yellow) is in the bible (pink).</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig16" src="../images/03fig16.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-16: A pin stack aligned with the shear line</em><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_33"/></p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title" id="ch3side1"><strong>MASTER-KEY SYSTEMS</strong></p>
<p class="sbnoindent">Locks in pin tumbler master-key systems are pinned a bit differently. A <em>master-key system</em> is a group of locks that have been pinned to allow some keys to open multiple locks (e.g., those keys handled by a security guard, manager, or maintenance person), while still allowing users to have their own key that works on just a single lock, such as on one office door.</p>
<p class="sbindent">The locks usually have three pins in one or more pin stacks: the driver pin and key pin are separated by a third pin of varying length. This increases the number of possible interfaces among pins that could open the lock. For example, the original key might push the pins such that the shear line for a particular pin stack is above the master pin, while the master key, which has a different cut depth at that pin stack position, might push them such that the shear line is below the master pin. Either way, the lock will open. The number of key combinations that can open the lock grows exponentially with the number of pin stacks containing master pins.</p>
<p class="sbindent">Master keying is a complex topic that would take an entire book to fully explain, and one that locksmiths take a long time to learn. Luckily, such locks don’t usually appear in competitions, so we won’t go into detail about them in this book.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">If the key’s cut for a particular pin stack is too shallow (that is, the key is too tall in this position), the key pin is <em>overset</em>, meaning part of it is being pushed past the edge of the plug and is now protruding into the bible (see <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig17">Figure 3-17</a>). Attempts to turn the plug will fail because the key pin is blocking its rotation.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig17" src="../images/03fig17.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-17: A key pin blocking the plug’s rotation</em></p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_34"/>If the key’s cut is too deep (so the key is too short in this position), the driver pin will extend down out of the bible and sit partially in the plug, as shown in <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig18">Figure 3-18</a>. This is also the default state of the lock when no key is inserted. Attempting to turn the plug in this state will also fail, as the driver pin prevents the plug from rotating.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig18" src="../images/03fig18.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-18: A driver pin blocking the plug’s rotation</em></p>
<p class="indent">If all the key’s cuts correctly correspond to the key pin length for every pin stack in the lock, then all the key pins and driver pins align at the shear line. The plug can then rotate freely, and the lock will open. This is shown in <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig19">Figure 3-19</a>. The depths of the key cuts are collectively known as the key’s <em>bitting</em>.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig19" src="../images/03fig19.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-19: The correct key aligning all six pin stacks at the shear line</em></p>
<p class="indent">Two sets of numbers are used to describe the bitting of a pin tumbler key: the position and the depth. Almost all pin tumbler brands refer to the cut closest to the <em>head</em>, or <em>bow</em>, of the key (the part that you typically grasp to use the key) as position 1, the next pin stack as position 2, and so on. Thus, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_35"/>position 1 on the key corresponds to the pin stack closest to the face of the lock. We’ll be using this convention throughout this book.</p>
<p class="indent">Most brands use the number 0 to describe the shallowest possible key cut (corresponding with the shortest key pin), and a number like 5, 6, or 9 to describe the deepest possible cut and longest key pin. Therefore, a bitting of 2-5-3-1-3 describes a key for a lock containing five pin stacks, with a cut depth of 2 closest to the bow and 3 on the tip of the key. As you might have noticed, a key can use the same depth (3 in this example) at multiple positions.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig20">Figure 3-20</a> shows a key with a bitting of 1-3-2-5-1-5; the pin stack positions are labeled in purple, and cut depths are labeled in red.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig20" src="../images/03fig20.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-20: A key with a bitting of 1-3-2-5-1-5</em></p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>Cut depths vary from brand to brand; a 2 cut on a Kwikset is unlikely to be the same depth as a 2 cut on an ABUS. The spacing between cuts also varies. It’s important to look up the specifications for a lock brand before impressioning, cutting keys, or repinning a lock. We’ll discuss the specifications for locks used in impressioning competitions in <a href="ch11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a></em>.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Pin tumbler locks vary in the number of pin stacks they contain. Theoretically, more stacks mean a more secure lock, but a well-made lock with a few stacks is probably more secure than a poorly made lock with many stacks. Having more pin stacks also means you can have a higher number of unique keys, which is important for <em>systems</em> (installations of multiple locks) that might need many distinct locks, like on a large campus. Generally, in the US, pin tumbler locks used on homes have five pin stacks, while padlocks have four, though this varies considerably by brand and model. In the UK, six-pin locks are more common.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>Dimple Locks</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent"><em>Dimple locks</em> operate much like pin tumbler locks, except that the cuts are made on the broad, flat side of the key instead of the edge. This has advantages and disadvantages. Because the flat side’s surface area is much larger, dimple locks can have more pin stacks than pin tumbler locks without <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_36"/>requiring a longer key. However, the cut depths are far more limited, since these keys are usually no thicker than pin tumbler keys. <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig21">Figure 3-21</a> shows a typical dimple lock and key.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig21" src="../images/03fig21.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-21: A six-pin dimple lock and key</em></p>
<p class="indent"><a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig22">Figure 3-22</a> shows a more advanced set with over a dozen cuts.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig22" src="../images/03fig22.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-22: A high-end Euro profile cylinder dimple lock and key</em></p>
<p class="indent">Many dimple lock keys are made to be reversible so they can be inserted with either face up, but this limits the cut depths even further. As a result, while many pin tumbler locks have about 7 to 10 possible cut depths, dimple locks may have only 2 to 4.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>Tubular Locks</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent"><em>Tubular locks</em> have the same parts as a pin tumbler, though they are organized differently. The pin stacks are arranged in a circle, with the key pins all pointing toward the face of the lock. A tubular lock’s key is a metal tube with the bitting usually notched in a circle on the tip, as shown on the right in <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig23">Figure 3-23</a>. The bitting for the key on the left is inside the tube.</p>
<div class="imagec"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_37"/><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig23" src="../images/03fig23.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-23: Two styles of tubular keys</em></p>
<p class="indent">Tubular locks are typically found on vending machines, gas pumps, and arcade games; bicycle locks and laptop locks also are often tubular. The number of pins varies by brand, but seven-pin locks like the one shown in <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig24">Figure 3-24</a> are the most common (the seventh pin in this image, at the 3 o’clock position, may be difficult to see). Tubular locks are sometimes referred to as <em>Ace locks</em> or <em>Chicago locks</em>, because the Chicago Lock Company, now known as CompX, has manufactured a popular tubular lock model called the ACE (and later, the ACE II) for decades.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig24" src="../images/03fig24.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-24: A tubular lock with seven pins</em></p>
<p class="indent">In the early 2000s, tubular locks got a bad reputation after several videos and news articles showed that low-end laptop and bike locks could be opened simply by jabbing the barrel of a cheap ballpoint pen into the keyway. Quality tubular locks like the ACE II aren’t susceptible to this kind of attack, but the perception that all tubular locks are bad still persists.</p>
<p class="indent">While tubular locks can be picked with standard picking tools, the process is tedious, as you must pick each pin stack multiple times while rotating the plug. Using specialty tubular picking tools that keep the picked pin stacks at the shear line is much easier but can be expensive, as you’ll need different tools for tubular locks of different diameters.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec29"><em>Wafer Locks</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">A <em>wafer lock</em> also works similarly to a pin tumbler lock, but instead of pins, it contains flat, spring-loaded wafers that move up and down, riding along the surface of a key. A bit of metal protrudes from the top and bottom of each wafer, blocking the plug from rotating if the wafer is too high or too low. <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig25">Figure 3-25</a> shows a wafer plug with five wafers protruding from the top, and a sixth wafer-like clip that keeps the plug in the housing.</p>
<div class="imagec"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_38"/><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig25" src="../images/03fig25.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-25: A wafer lock plug</em></p>
<p class="indent">Wafer locks are frequently found on automobiles and on furniture such as file cabinets. Low-end safes, like fire-rated document boxes and cash boxes found in big box stores, often feature cheap—and therefore exceptionally poor—wafer locks.</p>
<p class="indent">Wafers are thinner than pins, so a wafer lock can hold more wafers than the number of pins in a pin tumbler lock of the same size. It’s common to find 10-wafer automotive locks. However, like dimple locks, wafer locks are typically limited to only three or four possible key cut depths. <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig26">Figure 3-26</a> shows a wafer lock cylinder and key.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig26" src="../images/03fig26.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-26: A DOM wafer lock cylinder and key</em></p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec30"><em>Combination Locks</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">Instead of using a key, you unlock dial-based, or <em>combination</em>, locks by dialing a series of numbers. Combination locks range from the cheap padlocks ubiquitous in gym locker rooms to high-end safe locks used to secure secret government documents and vault doors in large banks. The method of inputting the combination and the internal mechanism varies among locks, so we’ll focus on safe locks—those found on decent safes, not the cheap, allegedly fireproof boxes you can buy at an office supply store.</p>
<p class="indent">A safe lock has a dial on the face that you spin clockwise and counterclockwise to input a numeric combination. Behind this dial is a <em>dial ring</em>, which has an opening index mark, often at the 12 o’clock position, to indicate where you should stop when entering a number before changing direction to enter the next number in the combination. The dial ring also <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_39"/>usually has a change index, typically at the 11 o’clock position, where you can enter a new combination if the lock is in its combination change state. (You do so by first unlocking the lock, then inserting a special <em>change key</em> into the back side.) <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig27">Figure 3-27</a> shows a dial ring and dial.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig27" src="../images/03fig27.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-27: The dial and dial ring of a safe lock</em></p>
<p class="indent">Inside the lock, the spinning of the dial rotates the wheels within the wheel pack. When all the wheels are aligned in the correct position, the fence drops into the groove created by their gates. With the fence in the gates, rotating the dial will pull a lever connected to the fence, which is connected to the bolt and opens the lock. <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig28">Figure 3-28</a> shows the wheel pack and fence of a cutaway safe lock. We’ll discuss opening safe locks in <a href="part4.xhtml">Part IV</a>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Rather than using pins, <em>lever locks</em> have metal levers that pivot and are lifted by a key. Each lever has a slot and a gate where a metal protrusion on the lock’s bolt, called the <em>stump</em>, rests and can pass through. When the slots on each lever align, the stump can pass through to unlock the door. Lever locks come in padlock format, but the mortise lockset format, shown in <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig29">Figure 3-29</a>, is the most common type.</p>

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-29: A Russian-style mortise lever lock with its case removed</em></p>
<p class="indent">Generally, the more levers a lock has, the more pick resistant it is. Many lever locks have five levers, though models with as few as three or as many as eight are also common. <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig30">Figure 3-30</a> shows a key lifting the levers of the lock in <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig29">Figure 3-29</a>. This lock normally contains eight levers, but four have been removed here to better show how the key and levers interact.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="sec32"><em>Warded Locks</em></h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Warded locks</em> are similar to lever locks, but they have only a single lever that opens the lock. While that might not sound very secure, these locks also rely on <em>wards</em>—obstacles within the lock that block pieces of metal other than the key from activating the lever. <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig31">Figure 3-31</a> shows a warded lock and key.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig31" src="../images/03fig31.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-31: A warded lock and its key</em></p>
<p class="indent"><em>Skeleton keys</em> originated from warded locks. The idea of a skeleton key is to remove as much material as possible (leaving only the “skeleton” of the key) while still allowing the key to contact the lever and open the lock. Removing the excess material increases the likelihood that the key will work in other warded locks, as the metal that may have gotten bound up in the wards is gone.</p>
<p class="indent">Many older warded locks are quite beautiful, with intricately designed wards and keys. Warded locks are still made today; Master Lock sells a warded padlock, shown in <a href="ch3.xhtml#ch3fig32">Figure 3-32</a>.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch3fig32" src="../images/03fig32.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-32: A modern warded lock</em></p>
<p class="indent">While warded locks can’t compete with more modern mechanisms, they’re sufficient for some applications, like furniture locks or as part of a multilayered security system. And with fewer moving parts than most other locking mechanisms, they’re sometimes purchased for low-security outdoor or industrial uses, such as lighting controls in public parks.</p>
<p class="indent">Since opening such an easy lock doesn’t involve much sport, warded locks generally don’t appear in locksport competitions. That said, a good <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_42"/>understanding of warded locks can be helpful for picking lever locks. We’ll discuss them further in <a href="ch15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec33"><em>Disc Detainer Locks</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">Finally, the <em>disc detainer</em> is a unique locking mechanism that uses thin, round discs not unlike the wafers in wafer locks. However, instead of using springs and being lifted, the discs rotate into position. Each disc has a small gate in its outer edge, similar to that in a safe lock’s wheels. If the gates on every disc align, a <em>sidebar</em>—a metal bar that normally blocks the plug from rotating, somewhat akin to a fence—drops into the groove, and the plug can then rotate to open the lock (see <a href="ch7.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>). The bitting on a disc detainer key is a series of angled cuts designed to align the discs.</p>
<p class="indent">Because of their unique design, picking disc detainer locks requires specialty tools. In addition, different models often require different tools because of variations in the way the locks are tensioned or in the shape of the keyway. The number of discs in each lock can range from a few in basic models to more than 10 in higher-end offerings.</p>
<p class="indent">The disc detainer locking mechanism is found in some high-quality bicycle locks, a few models of padlocks from German manufacturer ABUS, and, most commonly, in offerings from the ABLOY brand of locks.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title" id="ch3side2"><strong>ASSA, ABLOY, AND ASSA ABLOY</strong></p>
<p class="sbnoindent">Disc detainers were first created and sold by the ABLOY lock company in Finland in the early 1900s. ABLOY is still the leading manufacturer of disc detainer locks, and its high-end disc detainer models, such as the ABLOY Protec<sup>2</sup> shown here, are considered some of the most pick-resistant locks sold today.</p>
<div class="image1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/03fig33.jpg"/></div>
<p class="sbindent">If ABLOY sounds vaguely familiar, that’s probably because Swedish lock company ASSA merged with it in the mid-1990s, forming the ASSA ABLOY Group. In the years since, ASSA ABLOY has acquired many other lock manufacturers, including Yale, Medeco, Vachette, UNION, Lockwood, KESO, Corbin Russwin, and Mul-T-Lock, making it one of the largest lock manufacturers in the world.</p>

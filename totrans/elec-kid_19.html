<p class="noindent">Why do the lights in a house turn on when you flip a switch? How does a remote-controlled car move? And what makes lights on TVs and microwaves blink? The technology around you may seem like magic, but most of it wouldn’t run without electricity.</p>&#13;
<p class="indentb"><em>Electronics for Kids</em> demystifies electricity with a collection of awesome hands-on projects. In <a href="part01.xhtml#part01">Part 1</a>, you’ll learn how current, voltage, and circuits work by making a battery out of a lemon, turning a metal bolt into an electromagnet, and transforming a paper cup and some magnets into a spinning motor. In <a href="part02.xhtml#part02">Part 2</a>, you’ll make even more cool stuff as you:</p>&#13;
<p class="bull"><span class="green">•</span> Solder a blinking LED circuit with resistors, capacitors, and relays</p>&#13;
<p class="bull"><span class="green">•</span> Turn a circuit into a touch sensor using your finger as a resistor</p>&#13;
<p class="bull"><span class="green">•</span> Build an alarm clock triggered by the sunrise</p>&#13;
<p class="bull"><span class="green">•</span> Create a musical instrument that makes sci-fi sounds</p>&#13;
<p class="indentt">Then, in <a href="part03.xhtml#part03">Part 3</a>, you’ll learn about digital electronics—things like logic gates and memory circuits—as you make a secret code checker and an electronic coin flipper. Finally, you’ll use everything you’ve learned to make the LED Reaction Game—test your reaction time as you try to catch a blinking light!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">With its clear explanations and assortment of hands-on projects, <em>Electronics for Kids</em> will have you building your own circuits in no time.</p>&#13;

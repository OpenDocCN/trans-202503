- en: Andy Rubin always had a thing for robots and machines of any sort. He continued
    that interest in all of his projects, including leaving Android in 2013 to work
    on robots in a different department at Google.

- en: One robotics project Andy worked on was a barista; he built a robot to create
    latté art. It’s not clear if he got it completely working, but there was an area
    in one of the upstairs micro-kitchens in building 45 that housed an odd-looking
    machine. The area was roped off for protection (of potential customers^([1](#c33-footnote-1))).

    and spread to other buildings, they scattered across the Google campus.

    framework team area in building 44\. Over time he accumulated accessories such
    as a Canadian flag cape, a hockey stick, and a Noogler hat. (Picture courtesy

    a maximum level of detail, leaving no stone unturned. I cannot know what features
    or techniques you will find most useful—that depends on the nature of your work
    and your personal tastes. That's why this book tries to cover *everything* Inkscape
    has to offer.

    I will mention all sorts of Inkscape *preferences* you can change to tweak the
    program's capabilities and better adapt it to the way you prefer to work. Before
    you begin using Inkscape for anything of consequence, let's see how and where
    all the various preferences are set and stored in Inkscape.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3.1.1 Inkscape Preferences
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Inkscape preferences* (often called *global preferences* or just*preferences*)
    control those aspects of the program that do not depend on a particular document
    you''re editing. These include the default behavior of various tools and shortcuts,
    details of treatment of various object types, display and color management options,
    and so on.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most of these options are edited in the Preferences dialog (press Shift-Ctrl-P
    or select **Edit ▶ Preferences**). Some preferences, however, are set by commands
    or shortcuts; for example, when you hide or show scroll bars by pressing Ctrl-B
    (or choosing the equivalent command from the View ▶ Show/Hide submenu), that setting
    is also remembered as a global preference.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Throughout the book, I will discuss specific global options where they are relevant,
    referring to the corresponding pages of the Preferences dialog. The tree of pages
    is in the left pane of the dialog; above it, there is a search field where you
    can type to search within the entire contents of the dialog. Each option in the
    dialog has a description; if you need help, just hover your mouse over an option
    and read the floating tool tip ([Figure 3-1](#fig3-1)).

    description. All global preferences are automatically saved when you exit the
    program.
  prefs: []

    you can view (and change) its location from the Preferences dialog itself, System
    page.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some little-used options have no UI; the only way to set them is by manually
    editing the preferences.xml file. This is an XML file with a simple and largely
    self-explanatory format. You may need to change a specifically named attribute
    of an element with a certain ID, for example, `printing`. You would then load
    that file in a text editor, search for the string `id="printing"`, and edit the
    value of the specified attribute in that element, for example, by replacing `attribute="old"`
    with `attribute="new"` (note that attribute values are always in quotes).

    for which they are set. For example, if you change snapping modes in one document,
    Inkscape will remember it the next time you load that document, but other documents

    edit the document template used to create those documents, as you'll see in the
    next section.

    window cannot exist without some document loaded into it, so if you don't give
    it an existing document to load, it will create a new one for you.
  prefs: []

    is being edited, just press Ctrl-N or use **File ▶ New**. This will create a document
    based on the *default template*. However, Inkscape also has a number of other
    templates that you can use by going to File ▶ New From Template. Just select a
    template from the list on the left, set its parameters (such as size) if necessary,
    and click **Create from template** ([Figure 3-3](#fig3-3)).

    icon and web banner sizes, desktop sizes (for wallpapers), CD/DVD covers, business
    cards, and so on. A template does not have to be empty—it may contain any objects
    or document settings that can be useful. For example, look at the Seamless pattern
    template that has extensive instructions (top left) and a test tiling area (right)
    for the seamless pattern square in the middle, as shown in [Figure 3-4](#fig3-4).

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the simplest case (templates without parameters), a template is just a regular
    Inkscape SVG document; when creating a new document, Inkscape simply makes a copy
    of such a template. You can add your own templates to the list; any document that
    is a better starting point than the default empty canvas can be turned into a
    template. For this, just copy or save the document to the user templates folder
    you can open from Preferences, System page, by clicking Open next to User templates.
    You can even override the standard templates if you use the same name for your
    custom template; in particular, if you save your template as default.svg, it will
    be used for all new documents created when you run Inkscape or press Ctrl-N.

    pointing device. What probably *won't* work is any device where you point with
    your fingers, such as a touchscreen or a laptop touchpad—human fingers are too
    blunt for precise graphics work. A regular computer mouse works just fine, and
    most people do all kinds of Inkscape work with nothing but a mouse.
  prefs: []

    you may want to get a pressure-sensitive graphics tablet such as those made by
    Wacom, HUION, or XP-Pen. With it, you get more natural pointing and drawing with
    a pen and the ability to create variable-width strokes that depend on pressure—just
    like the darkness of a regular pen or pencil trace depends on how hard you press
    it on paper.

    your work habits are not adequately covered by the existing shortcuts.

    tab) the keyboard modifiers for the most common mouse actions (canvas panning,
    selection, movement, and transformation). The shortcuts you cannot (yet) configure
    include those limited to a single tool or mode.

    (Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW, Xara Xtreme, Macromedia Freehand) as well as for
    some minor vector editors (Zoner Draw, ACD Systems Canvas). There's also a variant
    of the standard layout that places the most often used commands on the left half
    of the keyboard so you can avoid lifting your right hand from the mouse or tablet.
    It may be that one of these emulations suits you better than Inkscape's default,
    so you don't have to edit shortcuts one by one.

    welcome any help in improving these alternative layouts or adding new ones.

- en: The shortcuts in the list are grouped by the menus that have the corresponding
    commands; you can filter for a command you're interested in using the Search field
    at the top. To edit or assign a shortcut to a command, click in the middle column;
    once it changes to New accelerator... (accelerator being a fancy word for shortcut),
    just press the key combination you want and it becomes assigned to this command.
    Inkscape will warn you about any conflicts (shortcuts already assigned to other
    commands). If you messed up, use the **Reset** button.

    controls of the Selector tool display their values measured with the default unit
    of the document, although you can change that with unit drop-down to the right
    of them (see [Figure 6-10](c06.xhtml#fig6-10)). Similarly, status bar hints (for
    example, when drawing a path with the Pen tool, [14.1.1](c14.xhtml#section14.1.1))

    area, you can specify a custom size and the orientation (portrait or landscape).
    Inkscape's canvas is virtually limitless ([1.1](c01.xhtml#section1.1)), so you
    can draw anywhere on it, be it inside or outside the page; however, most standard
    SVG viewers will display only what is on the page, ignoring anything outside the
    page boundaries.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, if you're going to publish or share your artwork in SVG format, you
    can use the outside-the-page canvas as a clipboard or work area—but then place
    the finalized artwork onto the page. Printing or exporting to most vector formats
    also ignores everything outside the page. Bitmap export ([18.6](c18.xhtml#section18.6)),
    however, is more flexible; you can export the page rectangle, or the actual drawing
    (all objects), or just the selected objects no matter where they are located.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you've been drawing without much regard to page borders but now want your
    drawing to fit precisely within the page boundaries, a convenient way to do this
    is theResize page to drawing or selection button in the Document Properties dialog
    (click **Resize page to content...** to expand that area). Clicking this button
    makes the page border frame the selected objects or (if there's no selection)
    the entire drawing exactly; you can also specify any of the four margins.
  prefs: []

    the top and left sides, whereas the right and bottom sides move.
  prefs: []

- en: At other times, however, you may not care about the size of the page at all.
    For example, you may be working on a collection of icons or logos, all in the
    same SVG file, not intending to share the SVG but exporting each icon to a separate
    bitmap file. In that case, the rectangle of the page is just a distraction. The
    page border controls at the bottom right of the Document Properties dialog allow
    you to change the color and shadow of this rectangle or just hide it altogether.
    You can also place the border on top of the drawing so it remains visible over
    any objects that might otherwise obscure the edges of the page.

- en: The simplest way to zoom in or out using the keyboard is by pressing the plus
    sign and minus sign keys (+ and –), correspondingly. The keys on the keypad (on
    the rightmost end of the keyboard on most desktop computers) work just as well
    as those on the main keyboard (above the letter keys). What's more, the equal
    sign (=), usually located on the same physical key as the plus sign, also works
    for zooming in, and the underscore (_), usually on the same key as the minus sign,
    works for zooming out; in other words, you never have to press Shift to access
    the zooming keys.

- en: Zooming with the plus and minus keys works in all tools and modes, except when
    you are editing text. In text, the plus and minus keys on the main keyboard insert
    the corresponding characters, but the keypad + and – keys still work for zooming.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Often your hand is on your mouse or tablet pen, so reaching for the keyboard
    is inconvenient. The simplest way to zoom in by mouse is with the middle button
    (on most mice, this is not actually a button but a scroll wheel that you can click
    as well as rotate). The point you click will keep its relative position in the
    window after the zoom, so by clicking on some small object, you zoom into that
    object—unlike the plus/minus keys that zoom in/out of the center of the visible
    area. To zoom out, middle-click with the Shift key pressed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, with a scroll wheel mouse, you can rotate the wheel up to zoom
    in or down to zoom out. By default, you need to press Ctrl for that, because the
    scroll wheel without modifiers scrolls the document, as in most other programs.
    There's an option, however, to make it zoom without modifiers and scroll with
    Ctrl; you can set it in the Scrolling page of the Preferences dialog.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can adjust the amount of zooming in or out that the plus/minus keys, the
    middle click, and the single scroll wheel click perform. This value is set in
    the Behavior ▶ Steps page of thePreferences dialog. The default is 141 percent,
    which is 100 multiplied by the square root of two, so that two subsequent zoom-in
    keystrokes zoom you in exactly 200 percent.

    glass in the toolbar on the left). In my work, I actually never switch to this
    tool, because all of its commands and modes are also available in *any* tool via
    various shortcuts. Still, let's look at the Zoom tool for an overview of Inkscape's
    zooming capabilities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you would expect, simple mouse-clicking in the Zoom tool zooms in, and Shift-click
    zooms out. Sometimes, however, you already know the area that you want to zoom
    into, and you don't want to go through all the intermediate zoom levels to reach
    your target zoom. In that case, simply drag with the tool to create a rectangular
    rubber band around that area—Inkscape will zoom directly into the area when you
    release the mouse, as [Figure 3-13](#fig3-13) demonstrates.

    zoom area rubber band and zooms into it when you release the button.

    predefined zoom buttons: 100 percent (also via the 1 key), 200 percent (the 2
    key), and 50 percent. Then, there is the very useful Zoom to fit selection button
    (also via the 3 key); it zooms in or out and scrolls the view so that your current
    selection entirely fits into the window. The next three buttons do the same for
    the entire drawing (the 4 key), the page (the 5 key), and the page width (the
    6 key). You can also zoom to selection temporarily by pressing and holding the
    Q key; releasing it will return you to previous zoom (if there''s no selection,
    Q temporarily zooms to the page).'

    As mentioned above, zooming does not change the document—so you can't undo it
    with theUndo command. However, there's another way to "undo zooming."
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every time you change your zoom level, Inkscape remembers the previous zoom
    and the area of the canvas you were looking at. The Previous Zoom and Next Zoom
    buttons on the Zoom controls bar allow you to travel back and forth in this history
    of zooms. For example, if after viewing the entire drawing you zoomed into a small
    area, edited something, and then want to see the entire drawing again, you don't
    need to press the minus sign key repeatedly. Instead, just press the backquote
    key (`) and you'll be taken to your previous zoom and view instantly. The same
    ` key with Shift will then re-zoom you back into the same small area. The zoom
    history is unlimited—it stores all your zooms from the beginning of your editing
    session.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you *pan* a document in Inkscape, you shift the visible area inside the
    window without changing the zoom. It's basically the same as *scrolling*, except
    that scrolling assumes a single axis (such as up and down), whereas panning can
    go in any direction. After zooming, panning is the most common action when working
    in a vector editor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An Inkscape document window has the traditional scroll bars that will scroll
    both horizontally and vertically to reach any point on the canvas. Scroll bars,
    however, are pretty clumsy, so I usually prefer other methods for panning and
    turn the scroll bars off (Ctrl-B) to free up some extra room for the artwork.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can pan using the keyboard as well as the mouse. With the keyboard, press
    Ctrl with the arrow keys to scroll in any of the four directions. This is handier
    than it sounds, because if you press and hold Ctrl and an arrow key, the canvas
    movement *accelerates*. This means you can budge the canvas position a little
    with a single keystroke or swoosh it quickly aside if you press and hold. The
    speed of keyboard scrolling (the distance for a single keystroke) as well as the
    acceleration coefficient are set in the Behavior ▶ Scrolling page of the Preferences
    dialog.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the mouse, the easiest way to pan the canvas is by dragging it around with
    the middle button. Again, this works in any tool or mode. There's no dedicated
    "hand" tool for panning in Inkscape. You can also scroll vertically with the scroll
    wheel on your mouse and horizontally with Shift-wheel.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Inkscape tries to make panning automatic whenever possible. For example, when
    you drag selected objects with the Selector tool and push them against the edge
    of the screen, the canvas will automatically scroll to give way. Also, when you
    select a new object or path node with the Tab key, Inkscape scrolls to make this
    object or node visible.

    at work, you may have noticed how freely they handle their media. They slant,
    rotate, even overturn their drawings all the time for better view of their work
    as well as for a more natural pen swipe. You can easily do this in Inkscape, too.

    the cursor point, 15 degrees per notch (to change this value, go to **Behavior ▶ Steps**

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By default, Inkscape strives to render each document as closely as possible
    to how it should be rendered per the SVG standard. However, sometimes you need
    to*work* with the document, not just look at it, and such complete rendering may
    become an obstacle. This is when you switch to the *Outline* view mode (View ▶ 
    Display Mode ▶ Outline from the menu). In Outline mode, there are no fills, no
    transparency, no color, no gradients, no blurring or any other filters. Any object
    is shown as a thin outline whose width (1 screen pixel) does not depend on zoom,
    as shown in [Figure 3-16](#fig3-16).

- en: The obvious reason to switch to Outline mode is to make working with complex
    slow-rendering documents faster. Also, in Outline mode it's much easier to find
    and access invisible objects (those that are completely transparent or hidden
    underneath other objects). In this mode, everything is visible, and you can select
    any object by clicking its outline.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Different colors of outlines in the Outline mode are used to differentiate object
    types. Regular paths and shapes use black outlines, bitmap objects ([Chapter 18](c18.xhtml#ch18))
    are shown as red-outline rectangles with two diagonals, clipping paths ([18.3](c18.xhtml#section18.3))
    are green, and masks ([18.3](c18.xhtml#section18.3)) are blue. Text objects are
    the only kind of objects that are not outlined; instead, they are shown with black
    fill. You can also force bitmap images to render even in Outline mode; the corresponding
    option is on the Imported Images page of the Preferences dialog.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Outline mode is so useful that Inkscape offers two more ways to use it.
    Instead of switching the entire document into Outline, you can enable the *X-Ray*
    mode by choosing View ▶ Split Mode ▶ X-Ray from the menu or pressing Alt-6. In
    this mode, only a circular area around the mouse cursor is rendered in Outline
    while the rest of the document is shown as usual ([Figure 3-17](#fig3-17)). This
    way you can examine the structure of a complex drawing piece by piece without
    losing the context of the finished work. Or you can enable the *Split View* mode
    (View ▶ Split Mode ▶ Split or Ctrl-6) where the drawing is split into two halves,
    with a draggable vertical divider, showing normal rendering on the left and outline
    on the right.

    the same as Outline mode, but it adds a faded-out nonclickable rendering of the
    document in the background. You can still use the outlines to select objects,
    but this mode provides a better idea of what those outlines correspond to in the
    normal view.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yet another way to speed up rendering is the *No Filters* mode accessible via
    View ▶ Display Mode ▶ No Filters. By far the slowest-rendering element in most
    drawing is the filters, such as blur ([Chapter 17](c17.xhtml#ch17)). By disabling
    them, this mode may speed up rendering considerably without the drawing becoming
    unrecognizable. Another rendering mode, *Visible Hairlines* (View ▶ Display Mode ▶ Visible
    Hairlines), differs from normal rendering only in that it never allows strokes
    ([2.8](c02.xhtml#section2.8)) to become invisibly thin, no matter how far you
    zoom out; this may be useful in technical drawings.

    thePreferences dialog (section Proofing). Basically, what you need is an *ICC

    to use; for details, see [18.8](c18.xhtml#section18.8).

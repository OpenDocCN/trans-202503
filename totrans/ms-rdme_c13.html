			<p class="BodyFirst"><span class="DropCap">B</span>uilding a working relationship with your manager will help you grow your career, reduce stress, and even ship reliable software. Working with your manager requires mutual understanding. You must understand what your manager needs so you can help them. Likewise, your manager must understand your needs so they can help you.</p>
			<p>This chapter will help you build an effective relationship with your manager. We’ll give you a short overview of the management profession: what your manager does and how they do it. We’ll then discuss common management processes. Engineers often encounter abbreviations like 1:1s, PPPs, and OKRs, as well as terms like performance reviews, without knowing what they are, why they exist, or how they work. We’ll give you a primer and show you how to get the most from them. We’ll finish with tips to “manage up” and with a section on handling bad managers. By the end, you’ll have a toolkit to build a productive relationship.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-501836c13-0001"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_232" title="232"/>What Managers Do</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Managers always seem to be in meetings, but it’s not obvious what they are actually <em>doing</em>. Engineering managers work on people, product, and process. Managers build teams, coach and grow engineers, and manage interpersonal dynamics. Engineering managers also plan and coordinate product development. They might also weigh in on technical aspects of product development—code reviews and architecture—but good engineering managers rarely write code. Finally, managers iterate on team processes to keep them effective. Managers “manage” all of this by working with higher-level executives or directors (“up”), with other managers (“sideways”), and with their team (“down”).</p>
			<p>Managers manage up through relationships and communication with higher-level executives. Managers are the conduit between rank-and-file engineers and the executives making business decisions at the top. Upward management is crucial for getting resources (money and engineers) and making sure your team is recognized, appreciated, and heard.</p>
			<p>Managers manage sideways by working with other managers. A manager has two teams: the collection of individuals they manage and their peer managers. This pool of peer managers works together to keep teams aligned on shared goals. Relationship maintenance, clear communication, and collaborative planning ensure that teams work together effectively.</p>
			<p>Managers manage down by tracking the progress of ongoing projects; setting expectations and giving feedback; providing visibility into relative priorities; hiring and, if necessary, firing; and maintaining team morale.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-501836c13-0002">Communication, Goals, and Growth Processes</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Managers create processes to keep teams and individuals running smoothly. We covered the most common team-focused process <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_233" title="233"/>framework, Agile, in Chapter 12. This section introduces you to processes you’ll use to maintain your relationship with your manager.</p>
			<p>One-on-ones (1:1s) and progress-plans-problems (PPP) reports are used for communication and updates, while objectives and key results (OKRs) and performance reviews manage goals and growth. These processes are most useful when you know what they are and how to use them.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c13-0001">1:1s</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Your manager should schedule a weekly or biweekly 1:1 meeting with you. <em>One-on-ones</em> are a dedicated time for you and your manager to discuss critical topics, address big-picture concerns, and build a productive long-term relationship. One-on-ones are a well-known practice, but they’re often run poorly as status check-ins or troubleshooting sessions.</p>
			<p>You should set the agenda and do a lot of the talking in 1:1s. Prior to the meeting, share a bullet-point agenda with your manager. Keep a 1:1 document that contains past agendas and notes. Share your document with your manager and update it before and after each 1:1. Your manager can add their own items if they have topics to discuss, but your manager’s agenda should take a back seat to yours.</p>
			<p>We hit on two important points, so we’re going to stop and restate them: you set the agenda in a 1:1, and 1:1s are not for status updates. These two points alone can make the difference between hours and hours of wasted time and very productive and important conversations. Use the following prompts as topics for discussion:</p>
			<ol class="none">
				<li><span class="RunInHead">Big picture</span>  What questions do you have about the company’s direction? What questions do you have about organizational changes?</li>
				<li><span class="RunInHead">Feedback</span>  What could we be doing better? What do you think of the team’s planning process? What is your biggest <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_234" title="234"/>technical concern? What do you wish you could do that you can’t? What is your biggest problem? What is the company’s biggest problem? What roadblocks are you or others on the team encountering?</li>
				<li><span class="RunInHead">Career</span>  What career advice does your manager have for you? What can you improve on? What skills do you wish you had? What are your long-term goals, and how do you feel you’re tracking in them?</li>
				<li><span class="RunInHead">Personal</span>  What’s new in your life? What personal issues should your manager be aware of?</li>
			</ol>
			<p>One-on-ones create mutual understanding and connection. It’s normal to talk a bit about seemingly irrelevant topics—your cat, your manager’s love of colorful sneakers, the weather. You are working on building a relationship that’s deeper than an exchange of code for salary. Personal and off-topic conversations are important, but don’t let every 1:1 become a social visit.</p>
			<p>If you haven’t received a 1:1 invitation, ask if your manager conducts them. Not all do, but it’s common. If your manager doesn’t do 1:1s, ask them how they prefer for you to discuss typical 1:1 topics. Some managers prefer “lazy” 1:1s; they leave it up to individuals to set up a time to talk. If no meeting is scheduled, managers assume there’s nothing to discuss. You should have something to talk about most weeks; that’s a long list we just gave you.</p>
			<p>If your manager repeatedly cancels your 1:1s, you need to speak to them about it. Part of their job is to manage their team, and part of management is investing time with you. Being “too busy” is not an excuse. If they can’t find time to conduct a 1:1 with you, the issue should be addressed. Calling out repeated 1:1 cancellations can be a valuable signal for a manager. Such a conversation need not (should not!) be a confrontation; it’s the type of feedback your manager wants and needs.</p>

					<h2><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_235" title="235"/>the Lost 1:1</h2>
					<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Dmitriy was once part of a reorganization that jumbled teams around. He ended up with almost 20 direct reports, some of whom he’d been friendly with for many years, while others were new. There was a lot to do—get to know the new folks, establish a roadmap for the team, improve old systems, and create new ones. A full year later, Dmitriy discovered that since they were on friendly terms, Dmitriy had forgotten to establish a regular check-in with one of his reports! He didn’t make the discovery until the employee set up time to say that they wanted to switch to another team—and one of the reasons was that they wanted a manager who would be more involved in their career development. An existing friendly relationship is not a substitute. A manager who is too busy to do 1:1s might be too busy to be a manager!</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>You can set up 1:1s with people other than your manager, too. Reach out to those who you think you could learn from. In fact, 1:1s with senior engineers are particularly helpful if your company does not have a formal mentoring program; 1:1s are also a good way to get familiar with different parts of the organization. Again, make sure you have an agenda so you don’t fall back on “status check-in” 1:1s.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c13-0002">PPPs</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">A<em> PPP </em>is a commonly used status update format. A status update isn’t meant to account for your time; it’s meant to help your manager find problems, areas where you need context, and opportunities to connect you with the right people. Updates also surface topics for 1:1 discussion and help you reflect on where you’ve been, where you’re going, and what stands in the way.</p>
			<p>
				As the name implies, PPPs have a section for each of the P’s (progress, plans, and problems). Each section should have three to five bullet points <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_236" title="236"/>in it, and each bullet point should be short, just one to three sentences. Here’s an example:</p>
			<p><b>2022-07-02</b></p>
			<p class="ListHead"><b>Progress</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Debugged performance issue with notification service</li>
				<li>Code review up for email templating in notification service</li>
				<li>Spam detection service design circulated and milestone 0 service written</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="ListHead"><b>Plans</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Add metrics and monitoring to spam detection service</li>
				<li>Work with tools team to support PyPI artifacts in secure build environment</li>
				<li>Help onboard new hire—doing a code walk-through of spam detection service</li>
				<li>Work with database administrator to add index to preemptively fix performance issue on notification service before load increases for the holiday</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="ListHead"><b>Problems</b></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Having trouble getting team to code review my PRs—several pending</li>
				<li>Redis stability is an issue</li>
				<li>Interview load feels high—averaging four per week</li>
			</ul>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_237" title="237"/>Share PPPs with your manager and anyone else who is interested—usually via email, Slack, or a wiki. Updates happen periodically, usually weekly or monthly, depending on the organization.</p>
			<p>PPP updates are easy if you keep a log of past PPPs. Every time a new PPP is due, create a new entry. Look at your problems from the last PPP and ask yourself, have any problems been solved? Are any problems persisting? Solved problems go in the progress section of the new PPP. Persisting problems stay in the problems section. Next, look at your plans section from the previous PPP: Have you finished any of your planned work? If so, add it to the progress section of the new PPP. If not, are you planning on working on the task before the next PPP, or was there a problem that impeded progress on your planned work? Update the plans or problems section accordingly. Finally, look at your upcoming work and calendar. Update the plans section with any new work you are expecting to do before the next PPP is due. The whole process should take less than five minutes.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c13-0003">OKRs</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">The <em>OKR framework</em> is a way for companies to define goals and measure their success. In the OKR framework, companies, teams, and individuals all define goals (objectives) and attach metrics (key results) to each objective. Each objective has three to five key results, which are metrics that signal progress toward the objective.</p>
			<p>An engineer working on stabilizing an order service might define their OKRs like this:</p>
			<ol class="none">
				<li><span class="RunInHead"><span class="Caps">Objective</span></span>  Stabilize order service</li>
				<li><span class="RunInHead"><span class="Caps">Key result</span></span>  99.99 percent uptime as measured by health check</li>
				<li><span class="RunInHead"><span class="Caps">Key result</span></span>  99th-percentile latency (P99) &lt; 20 ms</li>
				<li><span class="RunInHead"><span class="Caps">Key result</span></span>  5XX error rate below 0.01 percent of responses</li>
				<li><span class="RunInHead"><span class="Caps">Key result</span></span>  Support team can execute regional failover in less than five minutes</li>
			</ol>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_238" title="238"/>Ideally, OKRs flow from the top of the company, through teams, all the way to each individual. Each individual’s OKRs contribute to the goals of their team, and each team’s OKRs contribute to the goals of the company. The engineer’s OKR, shown previously, might feed into a team OKR to improve stability, which might feed into a company OKR to improve customer satisfaction.</p>
			<p>
				Don’t make the key results a to-do list. They should spell out not how to <em>do</em> something but rather how you’ll <em>know</em> when something is done. There are many ways to reach an objective, and your OKRs should not box you into a particular plan. A silly example sometimes helps illustrate this point better: if your objective is to make it to Grandma’s birthday party, the key result is “be in Los Angeles by the 20th,” not “drive down I-5 on the 19th.” Taking the scenic route down the 1 or flying are perfectly acceptable alternative ways to make it to Los Angeles, and a well-formulated OKR gives us freedom to choose the right method at the time we need to make that choice, not when we set the OKR.</p>
			<p>Objectives and key results are usually defined and evaluated quarterly. Work with your manager to understand company and team objectives. Use the higher-level objectives to define your OKRs. Try to have as few OKRs as possible; it’ll keep you focused. Between one and three OKRs per quarter is a sweet spot. More than five and you’re spreading yourself too thin.</p>
			<p>
				OKRs are commonly set slightly higher than reasonable to create “reach” or “stretch” goals. This philosophy implies that you should not complete 100 percent of your reach-goal OKRs; this is a sign that you aren’t shooting high enough. Most OKR implementations shoot for a 60 percent to 80 percent success rate, meaning 60 to 80 percent of the objectives are met. If you’re hitting more than 80 percent of your objectives, you’re not being ambitious; below 60 percent and you’re not being realistic or are failing to meet expectations. (Why not set the OKRs at 100 percent and reward overachieving? Multiple ambitious goals give you flexibility on what to drop midquarter and don’t require the precision <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_239" title="239"/>that a 100 percent completion expectation would.) Make sure you understand whether your company treats OKRs as must-have goals or ambitious targets with some expected failure rate!</p>
			<p>
				Some companies use qualitative goals instead of OKRs. Others drop the “O” and focus only on the metrics—<em>key performance indicators</em><em> (KPIs</em><em>)</em>—without stating the objective explicitly. Regardless of the framework, individuals and teams need a way to set goals and evaluate progress. Make sure you know what your goals are and how success is evaluated.</p>
			<p>Not all companies set individual goals; some set only team-, department-, or company-level OKRs. If your company does this, it’s still a good idea to explicitly talk with your manager about expectations and how they’re measured.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c13-0004">Performance Reviews</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Managers conduct formal performance reviews at a regular cadence, usually annually or semiannually. Title and compensation adjustments are generally made during review time, too. Reviews are conducted using a tool or template with prompts like this:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What have you done this year?</li>
				<li>What went well this year?</li>
				<li>What could have gone better this year?</li>
				<li>What do you want in your career? Where do you see yourself in three to five years?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Employees self-evaluate first, and then managers respond. Finally, the manager and employee get together to discuss feedback. Employees normally need to sign off on the evaluation document after the discussion to acknowledge receiving it.</p>
			<p>
				Don’t work off memory when writing your self-review. Memory is spotty, and you might fixate on only certain memorable projects. Keep an up-to-date list of the work you completed throughout the year—a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_240" title="240"/>completed to-do list, a set of PPPs, or a bullet journal—to jog your memory. Look at the tasks you completed in your company’s issue tracker. What milestones, epics, and stories did you work on? Merged pull requests and code reviews also show work you’ve done. Don’t forget your nonengineering projects. Mentoring interns, code reviews, conducting interviews, blog posts, presentations, documentation—all of this should be recognized. Use what you have to write an honest self-review.</p>
			<p>Performance reviews can be stressful. Try to see a review as an opportunity to look back at what you’ve accomplished and to talk about what you want to do next; to openly acknowledge missed opportunities; to develop a growth plan for the next year; and to give feedback to your manager. You should never be surprised by your performance review feedback; if you are, talk with your manager about the communication breakdown. A successful performance review should give you concrete actions to achieve your goals.</p>
			<p>
				You might also be asked to participate in <em>360s</em> (as in “360 degrees”), where employees solicit feedback from coworkers in all directions: above (managers), below (reports), and sideways (peers). Coworkers answer questions like “What could I be doing better?” and “What are people afraid to tell me?” and “What am I doing well?” Ultimately, 360s encourage honest feedback and give employees an opportunity to tell managers how they’re doing. Take 360s seriously and give thoughtful notes.</p>
			<p>Managers should be giving feedback frequently throughout the year—during 1:1s, as an aside after a meeting, or over chat. If you’re not getting enough feedback, ask your manager how you’re doing in your next 1:1. You can also ask mentors or senior engineers.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-501836c13-0003">Managing Up</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Just as managers manage up to higher-level executives and directors, you “manage up” by helping your manager and making sure they help you. You can help your manager by giving them feedback. They can help <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_241" title="241"/>you by giving you feedback and helping you achieve your goals. And don’t settle if things aren’t working out. Dysfunctional management can be traumatic and damage your growth.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c13-0005">Get Feedback</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Reviews and 360s provide holistic feedback, but they are too infrequent to be relied upon solely. You need regular feedback so you can adjust quickly. Managers don’t always volunteer feedback, so you might have to ask.</p>
			<p>Use 1:1s to get feedback. Send questions to your manager beforehand; giving extemporaneous feedback is hard. Ask for specific feedback. “What can I do to get better with testing?” is better than “What can I do better?” Don’t limit feedback requests to technical questions. Ask for feedback on communication, career growth, leadership, learning opportunities, and so on. Use the prompts in the previous 1:1 section if you need ideas.</p>
			<p>Don’t take feedback at face value. Your manager is just one perspective (albeit an important one). Try to incorporate your manager’s feedback into your perspective rather than adopting your manager’s feedback outright. Ask yourself what gaps your manager has in their perspective, how their feedback fits with yours, what they know that you don’t, and so on.</p>
			<p>Give feedback on feedback, too. It can feel like feedback goes into a black hole. Tell your manager when their feedback pays off: “I joined the engineering reading group, like you suggested, and it’s been really fun to read papers and discuss them with engineers from other teams! Thanks so much for the idea. I’m learning a ton.” Positive results will encourage them to give more feedback. And let your manager know if feedback isn’t working out; they might have other ideas: “I joined the engineering reading group, like you suggested, and to be honest, it’s not working for me. They are discussing papers that aren’t super relevant to my work. Can you suggest other ways for me to develop connections to different teams?”</p>
			<p>
				You can also give feedback by asking for feedback. Asking how to do something will often expose gaps in processes. The answer to “How could <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_242" title="242"/>I have prevented the production incident last week?” might be “We need to build a test environment.” Give your manager the opportunity to reach a conclusion by asking for feedback rather than proposing a solution.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c13-0006">Give Feedback</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Good managers want feedback from their team. Managers need to know how things are going—what’s working and what’s not. Every individual on the team is going to have a unique perspective. Feedback eliminates blind spots.</p>
			<p>Feedback can be about anything: the team, the company, behavior, projects, technical plans, or even human resource policies. Raise problems, but don’t focus solely on them. Positive feedback is just as valuable: it can be hard for managers to know which changes had a positive effect, and their work doesn’t have unit tests.</p>
			<p>
				Use the <em>Situation-Behavior-Impact</em><em> (SBI</em><em>) framework</em> when providing feedback. First describe the <em>situation</em>. Then, describe the <em>behavior</em>: a specific behavior you find praiseworthy or problematic. Finally, explain the <em>impact</em>: the effect of the behavior and the reason it’s important. Here is an example:</p>
			<blockquote class="blockquote trade">
				<p class="Blockquote2"><b>Situation:</b> I finished up all the code changes to the new permissions service in January and handed it off to the operations team for rollout, but the service is still not deployed as of today, at the beginning of March.</p>
				<p class="Blockquote2"><b>Behavior:</b> The “upcoming releases” dashboard has moved the expected release date every week for the past five weeks. The database upgrade has also been pending for several weeks.</p>
				<p class="Blockquote2"><b>Impact:</b> This means we’re in danger of missing our deadlines, and a number of dependent projects are also delayed. Is there anything we can do?</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				The SBI framework avoids character judgments and assumptions about intention and motivation. Instead, it focuses on the facts and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_243" title="243"/>observable impact and steers the discussion toward mitigation and prevention.</p>
			<p>Note that you do not recommend a solution in the SBI framework. You might have solutions in mind, but it’s best to start with the issue and learn more before making recommendations. You might discover that you were missing valuable information or that a problem looks different than you thought. Discuss your solution ideas at the end of the conversation, after you’ve had the chance to consider the problem from a different perspective.</p>
			<p>Give feedback privately, calmly, and frequently. One-on-ones are an excellent venue. Feedback can trigger strong emotions, but try to maintain a clear head and keep the conversation constructive. Giving feedback in private permits your manager to have an honest conversation with you and can keep both parties from feeling attacked. Frequent feedback eliminates surprises. Don’t wait for a problem to fester until it’s too late.</p>
			<p>It doesn’t have to be all doom and gloom. The SBI framework works for positive feedback, too:</p>
			<blockquote class="blockquote trade">
				<p class="Blockquote2"><b>Situation:</b> We needed to write a design doc for proposed changes to the sign-up workflow last week and I took the opportunity to use the new design doc template you created.</p>
				<p class="Blockquote2"><b>Behavior:</b> The section on rollout and communication plans made us realize we completely forgot to loop the user support team in on the changes.</p>
				<p class="Blockquote2"><b>Impact:</b> They gave us a bunch of helpful feedback once we reached out! And it was much faster to write the document because we didn’t need to think about how it should be structured. Thanks for working on this!</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Whether it’s feedback to your manager or your peers, and whether it’s written or verbal, always try to make it the kind of feedback you would want to receive. Ask yourself, what problem are you trying to solve? What is the outcome you wish for—what does success look like?</p>
			<h3 id="h2-501836c13-0007"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_244" title="244"/>Discuss Your Goals</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Don’t expect your manager to know what you want from your career. You need to clearly articulate your goals and aspirations for your manager to help you achieve them. Formal reviews are a great place for such conversations.</p>
			<p>If you don’t have career goals yet, that’s fine. Tell your manager you want to explore; they’ll be able to help. If you have interests beyond your immediate focus, let them know. Don’t limit yourself to engineering, either. You might find product management fascinating or have the ambition to start a company. Think big and long-term. For example, you might say:</p>
			<blockquote class="review trade">
				<p class="Blockquote">Can we talk about career paths today? I’m honestly not sure where I see myself in five years or what my options even are. What are some of the common career paths you see and how do they differ? I’m enjoying my current project, but I am also curious about security. Are there opportunities coming up that might let me do something security-related?</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>If you know what you want to do, let your manager know and work with them to steer your work toward your destination. Part of a manager’s job is to align your interests with the needs of the company; the more they know about your interests, the more they can steer the right opportunities your way.</p>
			<p>Be patient after discussing your goals. There are only so many opportunities available. It’s ultimately up to you to make the most of what you’re given. Recognize that opportunities come in many forms: new projects, new challenges, interns to mentor, presentation opportunities, blog posts to write, training, or teams to partner with. Under the right lens, everything you do is an opportunity for growth.</p>

					<h2><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_245" title="245"/>Establish Your Support Network</h2>
					<p class="BoxBodyFirst">It can be difficult to give feedback, to deal with certain situations, or even to know what is normal and what is not. Trusted peer groups, both within and outside your organization, are a good way to sanity-check things. This goes double for members of underrepresented groups. Seek out organizations like PyLadies, /dev/color, and other communities who can talk through your situation and share their stories and experiences.</p>

			<h3 id="h2-501836c13-0008">Take Action When Things Aren’t Working</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Every employee/manager relationship is unique, so it’s difficult to give general advice. Each situation depends on the company, the team, the manager, and the employee. All we can say for certain is that you should be proactive if you feel things aren’t working.</p>
			<p>Relationships and jobs have ups and downs. A short-term rough patch can happen and doesn’t need drastic action. If, however, you are feeling consistent frustration, stress, or unhappiness, you should speak up.</p>
			<p>Use the SBI framework (from the “Give Feedback” section) to talk to your manager if you feel comfortable doing so. Speak to human resources (HR), your manager’s manager, or other mentors if you aren’t comfortable speaking to your manager. The course you pursue depends on your relationship with each party. If you have nowhere to turn, use HR.</p>
			<p>
				HR’s role is to maintain stability and keep the company out of legal and compliance trouble, which is not quite the same as making things right or fair. If nothing else, talking to HR ensures that there is a record of your concern. Companies do tend to react to <em>patterns</em> of concerns.</p>
			<p>
				If you’re told things will change, give your manager time—three to six months is reasonable. Managers need to think about feedback and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_246" title="246"/>implement changes. Processes or even organizational structures might have to be rebuilt. Opportunities to demonstrate change might be infrequent. Pay attention to the “slope” of change: Are things improving? Have you seen a commitment to improvement demonstrated through concrete actions?</p>
			<p>If time passes and you are still unhappy, it might be time for a transfer to another internal team or a new job. Internal transfers work well when you like your coworkers and company. A new company is better when problems are more systemic: a bad business, poor leadership, a toxic culture. Switching teams can be delicate; talk with the manager you want to transfer to and then with your current manager. Expect a team transition to take time as you hand off work to others, but don’t allow team changes to take longer than three months.</p>

					<h2>The Programmer in the mirror</h2>
					<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Dmitriy’s first job as a software engineer almost caused him to drop out of tech altogether. His tech lead for several years was a well-meaning person, a very good programmer, friendly, and, in retrospect, an absolutely terrible manager. He regularly made comments like “I thought UC Berkeley [Dmitriy’s alma mater] was supposed to be a good school” and “A real programmer would instead . . . ,” and he made jokes about firing people. He even installed a bicycle mirror on his monitor to watch Dmitriy’s screen. Here’s the kicker: he had good reason to resort to a mirror. After a few years in this environment, Dmitriy had become completely unmotivated, didn’t have faith in his own abilities, and was slacking off a lot. He gave serious consideration to ditching it all and becoming a chiropractor.</p>
					<p>
						After some soul-searching, Dmitriy decided to give it another try at a different company. His next gig turned out to be the direct opposite, culture-wise. His new teammates had low ego, a lot of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_247" title="247"/>skill, and were convinced Dmitriy could solve any problem they threw at him given the right support. Dmitriy’s confidence grew and, with it, his motivation, focus, and skills. His career rebounded; it all worked out. But it almost didn’t happen because of one very good programmer who was a very bad manager.</p>

			<p class="BodyFirst">A good way to understand your manager is to read the books they read. Engineering management books will help you understand why your managers are doing what they’re doing. It’ll also build empathy; you’ll be exposed to some of the problems they deal with. Plus, you’ll pick up useful skills and be able to give better feedback to your manager.</p>
			<p>
				Start by reading <em>The Manager’s Path</em><em> </em>by Camille Fournier (O’Reilly Media, 2017). Fournier’s book walks you through the phases of a manager from a staff engineer through a VP of engineering. It discusses how each level of manager operates and gives more details on management processes like 1:1s. The book will also help you chart your own career path.</p>
			<p>
				Will Larson’s <em>An Elegant Puzzle</em> (Stripe Press, 2019) gives insight into the problems a manager faces and the frameworks they use to manage them.</p>
			<p><em>Thanks for the Feedback</em> by Douglas Stone and Sheila Heen (Penguin Books, 2014) will help you process review feedback. Feedback is an emotionally fraught topic. This book gives you tools to get the most out of feedback “even when it is off base, unfair, poorly delivered, and, frankly, you’re not in the mood.” Many of the book’s tools work well in other types of conversations, too.</p>
			<p><em>Managing Up</em> by Mary Abbajay (Wiley, 2018) takes our “Managing Up” section to the next level. The book discusses manager personas and how to deal with them. It also gives solid advice on tough managers and discusses what to do when it’s time to move on.</p>
			<p>
				Andy Grove’s book <em>High Output Management</em> (Vintage, 2015) is the classic book on engineering management. Written in 1983, Grove documents the philosophy and practices he cultivated at Intel—philosophies that have shaped modern engineering management. You should read it for historical context but also because it’s still really relevant. Chances are your manager has read it, so you’ll have a common reference point.</p>

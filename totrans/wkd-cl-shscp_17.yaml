    10 Anniversary Update (build 14393, posted August 2, 2016). You also need to have
    an x64-compatible processor and be a member of the Windows Insider Program. And
    then you can start installing bash!

    It’s free to join and will provide you with a convenient way to update your Windows
    release to the Anniversary release. The Insider Program has a Windows 10 Upgrade
    Assistant that will prompt you to update, so use that to update to the required
    release. This might take a little while, and you’ll need to restart.

    version of Windows 10 installed, you’ll need to get into Developer mode. To start,
    go to Settings and search for “Developer mode.” The Use developer features section
    should come up. From here, select **Developer mode**, as shown in [Figure A-1](app01.xhtml#app01fig1).

    mode may expose your device to harm. The warning is legit: going into Developer
    mode does put you at greater risk because you can inadvertently install programs
    from non-approved sites. However, if you can remain careful and vigilant, we encourage
    you to proceed so you can at least test out the bash sytem. After you click through
    the warning, Windows will download and install some additional software onto your
    computer. This takes a few minutes.'

    to enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux. (It’s very cool that Microsoft even
    has a subsystem for Linux!) Get there by searching for “Turn Windows Features
    On.” A window will open with a long list of services and features, all with check
    boxes (see [Figure A-2](app01.xhtml#app01fig2)).

    In the Start menu, search for “command prompt” and open a command window. Then
    simply enter `**bash**` and you’ll be prompted to install the bash software on
    your PC, as shown in [Figure A-3](app01.xhtml#app01fig3). Enter `**y**` and bash
    will start to download.

    `bash` and bash is ready to use.

    that’s going to be tremendously useful for Windows 10 users, but it’s good to
    know about. If you only have a Windows 10 system available to you and you want
    to learn more about bash shell script programming, give it a try.

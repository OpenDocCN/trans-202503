    another delivery immediately. This telescope would be the last, but Laurie still
    wondered how on Earth they fit into Winsome’s plan.

    smile.

- en: Laurie found it hard to argue with the excitement in Winsome’s voice, so she
    just trusted the usual set of odd directions to lead her to an answer. Before
    long, she and Xor reached an enormous tree. A long, twisty staircase wrapped around
    the trunk and up into the leaves, and a young woman stood at the base.

    for you.”

    lately. The Network is getting quite big now! I can hardly keep up with all the
    chatter.”

    and raced up the stairs, round and round the trunk of the tree. Laurie followed
    as best she could.

    It was a tree *lighthouse*! Not only that, but the lighthouse keeper’s room was
    filled with telescopes pointing in all directions. A neat label was attached to
    each one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in the air. And was that a rope?

- en: “Hey, that’s Fresnel’s balloon! I can see him! He’s waving!” Laurie exclaimed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Laurie looked into other telescopes. Each one was pointed at a different lighthouse.
    The one for ABSTRACT showed the lighthouse keeper who didn’t say very much, up
    in his tall white tower by the sea, looking back through a telescope of his own.
    He didn’t wave. The BYZANTIUM telescope showed half a pyramid covered in giant
    mechanical turtles. Bruto was busy counting bricks.

    Inside was a squat telescope. “Excellent! I’ve been waiting for this.”

    the Network is finished, we can do something *really* interesting: use the Network

    for a simpler Code that uses only four FLIPs or FLOPs, though I’m not too sure
    how that will work. We use the old Baudot Code to talk to each other about our
    ideas for new codes, and then try them out.”

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    Now, the Network will only get better and better as we learn how to use it. We
    can already pass a message from one end of the Network to the other in just a
    few minutes! Even the *Doppelganger* takes a couple of days to deliver the mail
    that far. Everyone will want to use it once we work out the bugs.”

    the assignments Laurie had been given in her time on the *Doppelganger*. If she
    got it done quickly, she could come back here and play with the Network. “So how
    do I get to the Garden?”

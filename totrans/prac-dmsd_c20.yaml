- en: Wilderness survival has an undeniable allure. It’s tempting to imagine being
    capable of fashioning a shelter out of sticks and leaves, or hunting game with
    a makeshift spear. In nearly all emergencies, however, staying in built-up areas
    is better than running for the woods. Putting yourself in unfamiliar surroundings
    and at the mercy of the elements, possibly without a way to turn back or call
    for help, is simply not a good self-preservation strategy—not when sensible alternatives
    exist.

    In some scenarios, prompt evacuation is the right move. The point is that when
    you have to hit the road, the road should ideally lead somewhere familiar and
    safe. There’s no shame in renting a motel room or crashing with a coworker or
    a friend, and the supplies needed for this eventuality are simple: some cash and
    a change of clothing will be worth more than a machete and a set of fishing lures.'

    only for a brief portion of the year. Otherwise, munching on leaves, bark, or
    grass is mostly a waste of time: just because a plant is edible doesn’t meant

    inexperienced hunters will probably have little success stalking squirrels with

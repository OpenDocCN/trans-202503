- en: In this chapter, you built on the foundations you laid in [Chapter 11](chapter11.xhtml)
    to implement two unsigned integer types. You waded through the C standard’s rules
    for type conversions and explored how those conversions impact both an integer’s
    representation and its value. In the type checker, you learned how signed and
    unsigned integers are converted to a common type. During assembly generation,
    you implemented zero extension and unsigned division and comparisons.

- en: In [Chapter 13](chapter13.xhtml), you’ll add a floating-point type, <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">double</samp>.
    Floating-point numbers are processed very differently from integers in hardware;
    they even get their own set of registers! As you’ll see, those hardware differences
    impact everything from type conversions to function calling conventions.

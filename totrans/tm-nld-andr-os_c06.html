<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">S</span>o now the Android team was at Google. All they had to do was hire lots of people, build out the rest of the product, and ship it. Easy!</p>
<p>Not quite. In fact, Android started out at Google pretty much as it had existed outside of Google: it was a small, secret project that nobody knew anything about. They just happened to work on the other side of the badge-access doors. Android wasn’t acquired to help fill out an existing group that was already doing this work; they were hired to <em>start</em> that effort.</p>
<p>At this point, the Android team was just eight people, only half of whom were actually writing code to build the product. They needed to figure out how to grow from a small startup pitching to investors into a department of people building and shipping products.</p>
<p>Part of that transition included finding their way in the new company. Tracey Cole said, “We were in building 41 in the hallway for a long time. It was weird. They kinda just left us alone.”</p>
<p>Swetland concurred: “The biggest thing was, for a month or two, just figuring out how to find our feet. We moved from a ten person startup to a 4,500 person company. We spent the first two weeks camping out in conference rooms because they didn’t have permanent offices allocated to any of us. Where do we work? How do we hire people?” </p>
<p>Hiring was the next step: Android needed more people. But hiring Android engineers proved to be difficult at Google.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c06-0001"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_36" title="36"/>Hiring at Google</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Google has always been famous in the tech world for its hiring process. Around that time, there were billboards up and down the main artery of Silicon Valley, Highway 101, displaying a cryptic math puzzle:</p>
<figure>
<img alt="" class="" src="image_fi/502680c06/f06001.png"/>
<figcaption><p>This equation greeted drivers at that time along Highway 101 in Silicon Valley.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The puzzle confounded drivers. There was no mention of Google, just a puzzle that would lead successful solvers to a recruiting site for the programmer-focused company. </p>
<p> An engineering candidate lucky enough to get their resume past the recruiter and into the system faced potentially multiple interviews, including a phone screen and in-person interviews with various engineers.</p>
<p>Google has always held the belief that smart software engineers can do any kind of programming work. This is why engineers that are experts in 3D graphics have ended up working on Japanese text implementation. Their skills and experience get them the interview, but the actual job they end up doing is based on the things that need to be done.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c06-footnote-1" id="c06-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup> It’s also why Google interviews test general knowledge of computer science fundamentals (algorithms and coding). These interviews skip what other companies view as a required step: grilling candidates about their domain expertise and the shiny items on their resume.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c06-footnote-2" id="c06-footnoteref-2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>This approach serves Google well in general because much of Google’s software is based on similar systems, so engineers can fluidly move from one group to another. It’s all just software, and any specific product knowledge is something that smart engineers can pick up on the job. So Google hires <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_37" title="37"/>clever engineers without looking for particular domain skills, assuming that they can learn what they need to do their job when they get to Google.</p>
<p>This hiring technique didn’t work well for Android. The type of engineer that is good at, say, creating algorithms for data analysis on servers may not have any idea about how to build an operating system. Or how to write a display driver. Or how to optimize graphics operations, or UI code, or networking. These topics aren’t necessarily covered in the computer science fundamentals that most undergraduates take, and they are also not things that arise in typical jobs that engineers have prior to arriving at the Google interview. Fadden said, “One of my interviewers told me that Google likely wouldn’t hire me because I was ‘too low level.’ We had a lot of trouble hiring device UI people because it’s very different from web UI.”</p>
<p>The skills needed to build a platform like Android are those developed through jobs and hobby projects that people took on because of their passion in these particular areas. The engineers that write operating systems are engineers <em>that want to write operating systems</em>. There are courses taught on the subject, but they are not taken by everyone and are necessarily cursory; only those who really love OS development will end up learning what they need to do in jobs and projects that they take on outside of classrooms.</p>
<p>Android needed specialists; there was not enough time to train a large team of generalists. For the project to have a hope of succeeding in a world with such strong competition as the mobile field had at that time, Android needed to deliver a finished product as soon as possible. They needed to build the platform quickly, which meant they needed to hire domain experts who could dive right in and get to work. But specialists who excel in writing an operating system don’t necessarily sail through Google’s generalist interviews. </p>
<p>Another problem was that Google, at that time, also expected an academic pedigree; the company preferred candidates from top engineering and name-brand schools. Specialists coming in with great experience, but a non-traditional education didn’t fit the mold and had a hard time making it through the process. This created problems with many early-Android team members, who didn’t have the academic credentials that the Google recruiters expected. Many of them didn’t have a college degree at all, much less one from a top-tier engineering school. Fadden said, “One 10+ year industry veteran had his hiring stalled because his undergraduate GPA wasn’t high <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_38" title="38"/>enough. For a company that favors Stanford PhDs, it was quite a shift to buy a startup where only one of the engineers graduated from college.”</p>
<p>Chris DiBona, who was working in Google’s open source office, was brought in to help fix the hiring problem.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c06-0002">Chris DiBona and the Hiring Solution</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Chris had a checkered academic past himself; he’d dropped out of college with one class left<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c06-footnote-3" id="c06-footnoteref-3">3</a></sup> when he moved to California years before. He had become a community organizer for Linux user groups in the area, which eventually got him noticed by Google in 2004. Thirteen interviews and three days later, Chris started at Google.</p>
<p>Chris became a regular contributor to Google’s hiring committees, which make hiring decisions based on feedback from applicants’ interviews. “I was seen as a useful person. If it was too permissive, I was the hard guy. If they were too harsh, I was the easy guy. So they would bring me in to balance out a hiring committee. And I was friends with the recruiters and the admins.”</p>
<p>Chris’s manager asked him, “Can you help Andy figure out hiring?”</p>
<p>Chris had already been through this difficulty with another group at Google: the “systems and platforms” team. That team also looked for specialists, like Linux kernel developers, so Chris had an idea of how to fix the problem.</p>
<p>“We’d spun up this ‘platforms’ hiring committee that was the source of unusual hires—people who were deeply specialized, but not very broad. But we needed them.”</p>
<p>Chris took Andy to that hiring committee, telling him jokingly, “When the recruiter says, ‘No, no, no, this person’s too specialized, we need someone who can go do all kinds of things,’ then you say to her, ‘If they want to leave my team, I’ll just fire them.’”</p>
<p>Andy didn’t actually say that to the recruiter, nor did he fire people for being too specialized. In any case, there wasn’t going to be a problem; Google was growing, and there would be an increasing need for all kinds of engineers, on Android and on other teams. So they encouraged the recruiter to accept those people anyway, and it worked. In the first year, that committee <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_39" title="39"/>hired about 200 people for Google, many of them for Android. People with the skills that the Android team needed were routed through that more specialized hiring committee.</p>
<p>But getting people through the hiring process was only part of the problem. There was also the added complication of just getting the right people to apply. Google was known at the time for search and ads, along with some web applications like the new Gmail app that launched the previous year. As Dianne Hackborn put it, “I’d never thought about working at Google, because I don’t care about search and web stuff.” Joe Onorato (who worked with Dianne at PalmSource and later joined her framework team at Google) agreed: “When I applied to Google in 2005, my girlfriend asked why Google has so many people. ‘They have a website with one text box and two buttons!’”<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c06-footnote-4" id="c06-footnoteref-4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Also, Android remained a confidential project. Even inside of Google, most employees didn’t know about it.</p>
<p>The Android group at Google couldn’t advertise that it was looking for developers to help write an operating system, or a developer platform, or even a mobile phone. Sometime later, the company was rumored to be working on a “Google phone,” but that’s about all the rumor mongers knew, and the team wasn’t allowed to talk about it. Instead, they would quietly reach out to former colleagues and tell them that they should apply.</p>
<p>Mathias Agopian (another person from Dianne’s team at Be and PalmSource who joined Android in late 2005) talked about the word-of-mouth recruiting process: “The few ex-Be people who were at Android were like, ‘You have to come!’ but couldn’t tell us what they were working on. ‘Just come!’” Once Mathias and others from Dianne’s team were at Google, they recruited her with similar vague offers: “They came to me and said, ‘You should come over to Google—there’s really cool stuff going on here!’”</p>
<p>David Turner, who joined the project in 2006, was able to discern more when he interviewed: “Many of the interviewers I had were engineers on the Android team. They didn’t want to tell me why I should join the company, so I asked them what they had done at previous companies, and . . . they told <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_40" title="40"/>me. So after six or so interviews, I had a good feeling that Google was indeed starting a new project for a smartphone or a PDA.”<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c06-footnote-5" id="c06-footnoteref-5">5</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c06-0003">Tom Moss and Hiring in Tokyo</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The difficult hiring situation for Android wasn’t specific to the Mountain View headquarters. Nor were the creative solutions.</p>
<p>Tom Moss (who was working on business development for Android) spent several months in Japan. Tom said, “We knew that the race was to get to scale, and to do that we needed to go international. Japan was picked as our first proof point.” Tom’s role in Japan ranged from cutting deals with OEMs<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c06-footnote-6" id="c06-footnoteref-6">6</a></sup> and carriers to evangelizing to local developers and sourcing local content for the platform. He was also responsible for hiring, to bring developers onto the team that could handle localizing the platform for Japan, plus related engineering work.</p>
<p>He took on this role both to help some of the partner relationships in that part of the world and to get more engineering talent for the team. In addition to the normal hiring difficulties, the candidates in the Japan office had to be not only top-notch engineers, but also fluent in English. The language requirement made the pool even smaller than it would have been otherwise. External hiring in Japan for Android just wasn’t working.</p>
<p>To encourage internal employees to apply to Android’s open roles, Tom gave a tech talk at the Google office in Japan. He described Android and the team’s culture and pointed out that Android was a top priority project for Google. By engaging engineers directly, he was able to quickly hire several engineers from other teams like Maps and Chrome. </p>
<p>Despite the difficulties finding the right candidates and getting them through the process, the hiring story wasn’t all bad; Google was willing to be creative to get the right people on board. Mathias Agopian was actually planning to go to Apple when he interviewed at Google. “I interviewed at Apple at the same time as Google. They even made an offer, which I took. It was going <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_41" title="41"/>to be for the graphics team, before the iPhone. I was really happy because I thought I’d finally be able to work on Desktop again. BeOS was a desktop OS. I didn’t really like that mobile stuff.</p>
<p>“But because of my visa situation, they retracted their offer. I was at the end of my six years on the H1-B.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c06-footnote-7" id="c06-footnoteref-7">7</a></sup> To stay, they would have had to do a green card, and it was complicated.</p>
<p>“Google had the exact opposite approach. I told them initially that my visa situation was complex. They said, ‘Whatever—let’s do the interview first.’ I did the interview, they made an offer, then I explained the situation. They said, ‘We never did that before. That’s challenging.’ Instead of saying ‘That’s too hard,’ they were saying, ‘Something cool to do!’ They said if it didn’t work out, I could work from Europe for a year. I even got a fallback offer letter from the Zurich office!”</p>

Sometimes it might be days or weeks into your orientation before you were matched with a team. </p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c06-footnoteref-2" id="c06-footnote-2">2.</a></sup>  One candidate that I brought in (many years later) met me for lunch on the day of their interview.

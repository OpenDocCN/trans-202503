- en: When I start hacking or making, it’s driven by curiosity. Only a small portion
    of my work ends up being relevant or interesting, but I journal my successes and
    my failures at my blog, *[http://bunniestudios.com/](http://bunniestudios.com/)*,
    and I occasionally tweet observations at @bunniestudios. It’s hard to know what
    will be a hit or a miss; but as long as I’m learning, the journey is worthwhile.
    And so I will keep wandering the electronic frontier ...

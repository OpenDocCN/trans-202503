    or entire infrastructures, identification and authentication are key concepts.
    In short, *identification* makes a claim about what someone or something is, and
    *authentication* establishes whether this claim is true. You can see such processes
    taking place daily in a wide variety of ways.
  prefs: []

- en: One common example of an identification and authentication transaction is the
    use of payment cards that require a personal identification number (PIN). When
    you swipe the magnetic strip on the card, you’re asserting that you’re the person
    indicated on the card. At this point, you’ve given your identification, but nothing
    more. When you’re prompted to enter the PIN associated with the card, you’re completing
    the authentication portion of the transaction, proving you’re the legitimate cardholder.

- en: Some of the identification and authentication methods that we use daily are
    particularly fragile, meaning they depend largely on the honesty and diligence
    of those involved in the transaction. If you show your ID card to buy alcohol,
    for example, you’re asking people to trust that your ID is genuine and accurate;
    they can’t authenticate it unless they have access to the system that maintains
    the ID in question. We also depend on the competence of the person or system performing
    the authentication; they must be capable not only of performing the act of authentication
    but also of detecting false or fraudulent activity.

    ID cards, fingerprints, or DNA samples. Unfortunately, with a few exceptions,
    such methods of identification are not unique, and even some of the supposedly

    to show a driver’s license, Social Security card, birth certificate, or other
    similar form of identification, this is generally for identity verification, not
    authentication. It’s the rough equivalent of someone claiming the identity John
    Smith; you asking if the person is indeed John Smith and being satisfied with
    an answer of “Sure, I am” from the person (plus a little paperwork).

    (say, a passport) against a database holding an additional copy of the information

    person standing in front of us. This may get us a bit closer to ensuring we’ve
    correctly identified the person, but it still doesn’t qualify as authentication;
    we may have validated the status of the ID itself, and we know that the person
    meets the general specifications of the person it was originally issued to, but
    we’ve taken no steps to prove that the person is really the right one. The more
    than we trend toward verification and away from authentication, the weaker our

    remove these from the system and enroll two of their other fingers. However, if

- en: Identification is an assertion of the identity of some party, whether it be
    a person, process, system, or other entity. Identification is only a claim of
    identity; it doesn’t say anything about any privileges that might be associated
    with the identity.

- en: Authentication is the process used to validate whether the claim of identity
    is correct. It’s different than verification, which is a much weaker way of testing
    someone’s identity.

- en: When you perform authentication, you can use several factors. The main factors
    are something you know, something you are, something you have, something you do,
    and where you are. An authentication mechanism that includes more than one factor
    is known as multifactor authentication. Using multiple factors gives you a much
    stronger authentication mechanism than you might otherwise have.

- en: The common set of tools used for authentication includes passwords, tokens,
    and biometric identifiers. Each of these has its own set of unique challenges
    that you will need to deal with when you are implementing them as part of your
    set of security controls.

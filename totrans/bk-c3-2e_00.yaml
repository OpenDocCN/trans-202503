    who’s been hand-coding HTML and CSS for a few years; you’re pretty comfortable
    with creating complex layouts, and you know not only your `div` from your `span`
    but also your `bold` from your `strong`; you’ve read a little about CSS3 and may
    even have started experimenting with some of its more decorative features like
    rounded corners, but you want to gain a deeper understanding of the fundamentals.'

- en: '*The Book of CSS3* helps you leverage the excellent knowledge you have of CSS2.1
    in order to make learning CSS3 easier. I won’t explain the fundamentals of CSS
    (except for the occasional reminder), as I assume you know them already. I won’t
    talk you through step-by-step demonstrations of using CSS to make a listed navigation
    or an image gallery, because I assume you can apply the examples in this book
    to anything you want to build on your own.'

    be able to do with it in the future. At the same time, I’ll take the dense technical
    language of the CSS3 specification and translate it into language that’s plain
    and practical.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: CSS can be used across many types of media; in fact, almost any device that
    can display HTML or XML can also display CSS rules, though sometimes in a limited
    form. CSS3 has modules devoted exclusively to paged media, such as PDF or printed
    materials, and it supports braille, handheld mobile devices (that is, cell phones
    rather than smartphones), teletypes, and televisions. The range and breadth of
    possibilities is so vast that I can’t possibly cover them all.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book focuses on CSS for the computer screen. All of the demonstrations
    are written for (and tested in) the most common desktop browsers, and are optimized
    for users of desktop and laptop computers. Almost all of the new CSS features
    covered in this book should work whether you’re developing for smartphones, tablets,
    or other devices, but I can’t guarantee that everything will display exactly as
    shown in the examples you’ll find here.

- en: I began work on the first edition of this book in 2010\. It’s been only four
    years, but how the landscape has changed in that time! In 2010, the iPad had been
    out for only a few months, Android had yet to explode, and looking at visitor
    statistics for my own website, visits from all mobile devices accounted for 11.6
    percent of sessions—compare that to the 54.8 percent count at the time of this
    writing.

- en: Since publication of the first edition of this book, we’ve seen four major versions
    of Safari and three of Internet Explorer. Firefox has become an auto-updating
    “evergreen” browser, Chrome has switched from the Web-Kit engine to its own Blink,
    and Opera has discontinued work on its own Presto engine to also use Blink.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition, the rise of preprocessors such as Sass and LESS has brought the
    power of programming languages into our stylesheets and dramatically changed the
    way we write CSS. Most professional developers now use a preprocessor as a core
    component of the website authoring tool set.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many CSS specifications have changed since the first edition, too. Some have
    been discontinued, and many more have been created. And the CSS3 of 2010 had many
    more cross-browser implementation differences, but the differences are much fewer
    today as browser vendors have placed more importance on adhering to standards.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In other words, this second edition is not simply a light edit of the first;
    every chapter has been fully revised to reflect changes to the specification and
    to remove outdated implementation information and experimental properties not
    in the specification. Certain chapters (those on media queries, Flexbox, grids,
    and the future of CSS in particular) are almost entirely new, and I’ve added new
    chapters on values and sizing as well as blend modes, filter effects, and masking.

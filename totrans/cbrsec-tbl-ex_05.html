<p class="CO">Now that the preparation work is complete, it’s time to deliver the tabletop exercise. This chapter puts you in the role of facilitator and covers a number of strategies that will help ensure your event is productive. Some of these are guidelines you can follow to stay organized and balance your responsibilities as facilitator, and others are recommendations for tools and techniques to boost participant engagement and create a more interactive exercise.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec1">&#13;
<h3 class="H1" id="sec1"><span id="h-86"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">The Facilitator’s Role</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">If you’re facilitating the tabletop, you have the challenging role of guiding participants through the scenario while simultaneously encouraging <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_84" aria-label="84"/>discussion. Even for seasoned facilitators, this can be a demanding task at times. Although each tabletop is different, you should limit yourself to the following tasks:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Providing clarification, when needed, about the scenario and injects</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Controlling the discussion so that the group can explore topics in their entirety while ensuring they don’t waste time going down rabbit holes that don’t align with the exercise’s objectives</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Identifying comments and concerns that warrant additional discussion</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Injecting your own professional expertise by asking targeted questions to explore potential deficiencies</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Recording themes and potential deficiencies to document after the tabletop exercise</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Keeping track of timing and working through the scenario at the appropriate pace</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">A facilitator is akin to a referee at a sporting event; you should allow the participants to discuss the scenario and intervene only when necessary.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">This means, first, that you must avoid dominating the conversation. As a rule of thumb, you should aim to speak no more than 30 percent of the time. Some facilitators mistakenly think they must control all aspects of the conversation; unfortunately, this discourages collaboration between attendees and fosters an environment where issues are less likely to emerge.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">You should also avoid “leading the witness” by overly managing the discussion. While attendees might sometimes need to be nudged in a particular direction, it is far more effective for you to ask questions that enable attendees to explore the topic on their own. This process fosters a more robust dialogue.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Don’t be afraid to tactfully challenge attendees by pushing back on an answer’s validity. Consider the following example:</p>&#13;
<p class="UL"><b>Facilitator:</b> How would you know how long the threat actor had access to the system?</p>&#13;
<p class="UL"><b>Network administrator:</b> We would know this after looking at the logs. The logs should go back 60 days.</p>&#13;
<p class="UL"><b>Facilitator:</b> Is the log retention period documented anywhere?</p>&#13;
<p class="UL"><b>Network administrator:</b> It isn’t. This is a normal time for us to retain logs based on size. Once the logs hit a certain size, they overwrite themselves.</p>&#13;
<p class="UL"><b>Facilitator:</b> What happens if the server is very active?</p>&#13;
<p class="UL"><b>Network administrator:</b> The logs might be there for only a few days.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">In this interaction, the facilitator’s follow-up questions surfaced two important issues: (1) there was no documented log retention standard, and (2) with the current log retention scheme and a very active server, it’s possible that only a few days’ worth of logs would be available. If the facilitator hadn’t followed up on the network administrator’s initial answer, the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_85" aria-label="85"/>exercise would have missed these important findings. However, you should avoid challenging every statement even if you are highly skilled in certain topics—you don’t want to create an adversarial environment or come across as a know-it-all.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Finally, you must always conduct yourself in a respectful and professional manner, even when an attendee says something that borders on outright incompetence (and may be recognized as such by other participants). In these situations, you must respond in a way that doesn’t belittle or embarrass them but still makes them aware of their error.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec2"><span id="h-87"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Tabletop Management Tasks</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">The facilitation process can be incredibly mentally taxing. You must simultaneously process attendee input and questions, scan the group for visual cues, keep the focus on the scenario, ensure that key points get addressed, maintain a tactful and attentive dialogue, defer to positions of authority in the room, and note any process deficiencies to be addressed in a follow-up report.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Needless to say, this role can challenge even the most organized individuals. The facilitation management tasks discussed in this section can help you reduce fatigue and focus on the discussion.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec3">&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec3"><span id="h-88"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Assigning a Scribe</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">One of the simplest methods of reducing your burden as facilitator is to completely eliminate one of your tasks: tracking the issues, deficiencies, and recommendations that will eventually find their way into the post-tabletop report. You can assign these tasks to what is commonly referred to as a <i>scribe</i>. This person doesn’t need to be an expert in information security or a related field; they just need to be familiar with the scenario so they can understand the exercise’s context, goals, objectives, and the role of the participants.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">The role of the scribe can easily be filled by a junior employee who might have a lighter schedule than most employees and could use the experience to learn about organizational dynamics and cybersecurity. Alternatively, the scribe could be someone in a mid-level function with a vested interest in the tabletop exercise’s outcome. For example, a risk management professional would likely benefit from viewing the incident response process and understanding the issues that emerge.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">The scribe must coordinate with you before the tabletop exercise to understand in advance what to track. While you’re facilitating the event, you should also have a discreet way of signaling (a glance or other nonverbal gesture, for example) when the scribe should record an important point.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">In addition to taking notes, the scribe could create an initial draft of the report for you to review. We discuss reporting in <span class="Xref1"><a href="chapter5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>.</span></p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec4">&#13;
<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_86" aria-label="86"/>&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec4"><span id="h-89"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Adding a Co-facilitator</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Another way to ease the burden of facilitation is to recruit a co-facilitator. This person can take on tasks like scanning the audience for questions or managing the presentation software. By agreeing to divide and conquer tasks in advance, you’ll each have fewer responsibilities. Also, one of you can take mental breaks while the other addresses a line of questioning. This gives you both opportunities to briefly reflect on the status of the tabletop exercise, contemplate future lines of questioning, and take a moment to mentally recharge.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">However, it’s important to choose a compatible co-facilitator. Compatibility comes in many forms, including:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="EX3"><b>Personality</b> Co-facilitating a tabletop requires close collaboration during all phases of the exercise. Choose someone with whom you can enjoy a cup of coffee (and not someone with whom you find yourself constantly checking your phone for an excuse to depart). You don’t need to be best friends; however, facilitators should have a degree of workplace chemistry.</p>&#13;
<p class="EX3"><b>Coordination</b> Ensure that you’re able to coordinate in real time while in front of an audience. This helps ensure that transitions between you during the exercise are as natural and seamless as possible.</p>&#13;
<p class="EX3"><b>Facilitation styles</b> Some facilitators have an aggressive delivery style, while others are more passive. Avoid mixing facilitator styles, which could give attendees whiplash as they adjust between questions from each facilitator. A tabletop exercise shouldn’t make the attendees feel like they’re in a game of good cop/bad cop.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="TX">In addition, having a co-facilitator can bring in different viewpoints and subject matter expertise. While one of you may be an expert in risk management, the other might be skilled in network security. These complementary skill sets could add more value to the exercise.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec5"><span id="h-90"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Inviting a Guest Presenter</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">To break up your facilitator role, you could invite a guest presenter to introduce specific facts in an inject. For example, if an inject for a senior-level tabletop communicates a new set of facts from the IT security team (such as the confirmed loss of sensitive data), the actual IT security manager could enter the room to brief the attendees.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">A guest presenter should present facts just as they would in a real incident. For example, the IT security manager could use the opportunity to practice announcing newly confirmed technical information. In addition to making the tabletop exercise more interactive, using a guest presenter has the benefit of acquainting participants with someone who would be involved in the response to a real information security incident. However, be sure to brief the guest presenter on anything they shouldn’t say to keep them from spoiling unknowns or contradicting scenario details.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec6">&#13;
<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_87" aria-label="87"/>&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec6"><span id="h-91"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Prewriting Questions</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">A common facilitation technique is to enter the event with several questions ready to ask participants. This is yet another way that you can better manage the litany of facilitation tasks during the exercise.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">In some tabletop exercises, attendees participate readily, and you might have trouble keeping track of the many valuable points they bring up. Having questions readily available for each inject can save you from trying to remember whether a fruitful discussion addressed all the important points. Alternatively, the audience may give short answers and engage minimally, leaving you struggling to find ways to spark the conversation. During such situations, having prewritten questions can help you jump-start stalled discussions.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Prewritten questions could be tied to a particular inject, or they could be generic and asked at any time. Make sure, however, that they align with the goals of the exercise and are appropriate for the participants. For example, if you aim to determine whether the organization has the proper tooling to detect and contain a cybersecurity incident, your questions probably shouldn’t focus on how to notify and update executive leadership of a breach.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">You should understand the correct answers to the questions you ask, ideally based on formal documentation. For example, if one of your questions involves log retention, you should be aware of a company policy requiring that select logs be maintained for 90 days. The point of asking questions you already know the answer to isn’t to pounce on a wrong answer; rather, it’s to help you craft pertinent follow-up questions and enhance your knowledge of the topic.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">You might want to work with the trusted agent on this task, as they’ll likely understand the questions worth asking as well as their correct answers. Examples of prewritten questions include:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Given what you know, what tools or logs do you have to confirm the known facts?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Based on the information provided, is this a cybersecurity incident?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">With this new information, do additional stakeholders need to be notified?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Given the current known facts of the incident, who is in charge of the response?</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">For each of these questions, there should be documentation that provides the correct answer (or at least superficial guidance).</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Finally, prewritten questions are an effective crutch if you feel nervous at the prospect of facilitating a tabletop exercise. While managing the numerous other exercise management tasks, you may find yourself stuck during a lull in conversation; having a question ready to go can be a godsend in that situation.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec7"><span id="h-92"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Exercise Tools and Tactics</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">There are a variety of tools at your disposal to assist with the tabletop exercise, ranging from a simple whiteboard and easel to live, online polling software. Of course, the fact that a new shiny tool exists doesn’t mean that it would be appropriate for the audience or enhance the exercise—or that you’ll know how to use it. You must be skilled at using any aids you bring along. A live tabletop exercise is not the time to troubleshoot a new technology or determine that you haven’t enabled the correct setting (and doing so is a surefire way to earn a collective facepalm from your audience).</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="NOTE"><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="NOTE-TXT"><i>Some of the suggestions in this section involve using technology to assist you in facilitating the exercise. Prior to doing so, make sure the technology is allowed. For example, does policy or business practice permit you to load certain software or store tabletop data on a company laptop or tablet? Some highly regulated environments prohibit the use of tools like remote presentation platforms, so it’s essential to understand any constraints in advance.</i></p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec8"><span id="h-93"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">A Writing Board</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">You or your scribe could use a writing board (such as a whiteboard, paper flipchart, or chalkboard) to record points as they emerge. This is particularly helpful when participants repeat an issue in a discussion; you can politely point to the writing board and remind them that it has already been discussed and recorded.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">A writing board can also serve as a “parking lot” for questions or concerns that need to be explored. Attendees sometimes fire off a battery of questions, and writing those items on the board “parks” them until you’re ready to explore them. This keeps you in control of the discussion’s flow while assuring attendees that their issue won’t be forgotten.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">If no writing board is available in the conference room, you could purchase an easel and flipchart to bring to the event. As previously discussed, make sure you’re aware of the features and shortcomings of the room before the time of your exercise.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec9"><span id="h-94"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Polling Software</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">One strategy to increase participation in a tabletop exercise you’re facilitating is to add interactive elements. For example, using polling software can be an excellent way to elicit audience interaction. Polling software lets you present a question to participants, who can answer using a smartphone, tablet, or laptop. As the participants answer, the responses might appear in real time, after a predetermined period, or when you end the submission period.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Polling software does require some additional coordination, and most polling software platforms have a nominal fee; however, they’re easy to use. Some online presentation platforms have built-in polling capabilities, eliminating the need for an add-on service.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_89" aria-label="89"/>Consider the following examples where polling software may be helpful:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">During an exercise intended to assess whether attendees are following the correct process, you could display a poll question asking whether a certain set of conditions would require notifying information security personnel. This could demonstrate whether attendees are taking the appropriate actions.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">By providing a question with a free-form answer, you could verify whether attendees respond with different and conflicting responses. This would demonstrate a lack of alignment on processes and the need for education.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Recording poll questions during a tabletop exercise may help satisfy an audit requirement and function as evidence of participation.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">A simple way to use polling software is to ask a question after presenting a set of facts. For example, <a href="#fig4-1">Figure 4-1</a> shows a poll question for an inject that asks, “Based on the known facts, would the following scenario be considered a cybersecurity incident?” The audience can visit the given URL to submit their answers.</p>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img id="fig4-1" class="img100" src="../images/pg89.jpg" alt="" width="1391" height="778"/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 4-1: A polling question for Inject 1</span></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX"><a href="#fig4-2">Figure 4-2</a> shows the results automatically populated in the presentation deck, either in real time or when the facilitator chooses. The results help the facilitator explore whether the audience’s answers align with the organization’s policy and if there are reasons for the deviation.</p>&#13;
<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_90" aria-label="90"/>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img id="fig4-2" class="img100" src="../images/pg90-1.jpg" alt="" width="1386" height="777"/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 4-2: The poll results for the Inject 1 poll</span></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">Polling software also provides the opportunity to ask questions that require more than a yes or no answer. For example, if you’re exploring who participants believe has the authority to take certain containment actions, such as shutting down key network segments or disconnecting the internet, forcing them to fill in an answer box on a survey may provide interesting results. As you can see in <a href="#fig4-3">Figure 4-3</a>, responses to a poll question mostly coalesced around two names (Jennifer and Taylor) but included a few others. Such a result may indicate that the organization needs to better define who is authorized to take specific, potentially drastic actions.</p>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img id="fig4-3" class="img100" src="../images/pg90-2.jpg" alt="" width="1390" height="792"/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 4-3: Results of an open-ended poll</span></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_91" aria-label="91"/>Another benefit of using polling software is that it lets you automatically capture data points that you can use for reporting. Automatically recording these answers saves time and can provide details that support your recommendations.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">As helpful as they can be, don’t use polls arbitrarily; they should always be oriented toward a particular issue.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Also bear in mind that technology is a fickle mistress. The actual tabletop exercise is not the time to discover that you need to adjust a default configuration. Rehearse using the polling software just as you will during the tabletop exercise.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec10"><span id="h-95"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Remote Presentation Software</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">If facilitating the tabletop exercise remotely, you must understand how to operate each feature of your remote presentation software. This is especially important if you’re external to the organization but required to use its tools. Fumbling with the software is a good way to lose credibility and frustrate those who devoted time to the event.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Features of remote presentation software vary greatly but probably include:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">The ability to create breakout rooms, which isolate groups of participants in their own virtual rooms to collaborate on a particular topic and then reconvene in the larger room</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Question and answer management, such as features that let attendees “raise their hands” when they wish to ask a question</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Onscreen whiteboards that facilitators can use to record issues and recommendations</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">The ability to spotlight a singular person, such as the facilitator, so camera views won’t constantly shift to whoever is speaking</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">Just as with the polling software, you should thoroughly test all features with multiple peers.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">It’s also important to establish ground rules for collaborating virtually at the onset of the tabletop exercise. Attendees may not be aware of certain features, so they might benefit from a quick primer on how to use those options. Common ground rules include:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Requiring attendees to “raise their hand” and be acknowledged before asking questions. This keeps multiple people from attempting to speak at the same time.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Mandating that all attendees turn their camera on so they can’t hide or focus on other tasks such as email. Note that this mandate may not align with the organization’s culture, so you should confirm it with the organization in advance if you are an outside facilitator. Also, avoid “camera shaming”—we’ve all had days where the last thing we want to do is be on camera in front of our peers.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_92" aria-label="92"/>Encouraging attendees to mute themselves when not speaking to eliminate unwanted and distracting background noise.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Creating a framework for using the chat room to ask questions, provide additional feedback, or accomplish some other purpose.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">Convey these ground rules to participants in advance to ensure they have ample time to prepare. In today’s age of remote working, not everyone works at a desk with a properly mounted camera and quality microphone. Communicating requirements early enables participants to plan a suitable location and participate in a professional manner.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">A co-facilitator or scribe can take on the role of monitoring the chat room, watching for raised hands, and maintaining a whiteboard. Especially during a hybrid tabletop exercise, using these features can be mentally taxing, as you have to pay attention both to a roomful of tabletop attendees and to those communicating remotely.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec11"><span id="h-96"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Multimedia Aids</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Multimedia aids, such as short video or audio clips, can help captivate your audience and break up the monotony of a slideshow. However, these tools must be relevant to the information presented thus far in the exercise. Attendees shouldn’t be left wondering how a video connects to the scenario. Consider the following examples of relevant multimedia aids:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">During a scenario involving ransomware, play an audio file found on a server impacted by ransomware. The audio file can contain an ominous voice (the threat actor’s) making it clear that the ransom must be paid within 48 hours or all data will be destroyed. Having a voice to connect with the threat actor adds a degree of realism.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">In a tabletop exercise for a hospital’s executive staff, greet attendees with a video of a news anchor informing the audience of a large breach at the hospital, complete with examples of data lost, panoramic shots of the hospital’s exterior, and an interview with a disgruntled patient, angry that their personal data was lost.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">Implementing these examples will take additional time and resources. However, they will help avoid the tedium of a long presentation deck, look professional, and create a better experience.</p>&#13;

<h5 class="BT" id="box-12"><span class="SANS_Dogma_OT_Bold_B_11">CASE STUDY: “NO COMMENT”</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Willow Creek Northern Electric Cooperative was reeling after a series of high-profile power outages caused by improper maintenance. The outages were particularly impactful, as they had forced a 911 emergency call center to go offline, as well as a hospital and nursing home to lose power. While the call center and hospital had backup systems, the backup generators had failed at</span> <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_93" aria-label="93"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">the nursing home, and elderly patients had been left in sweltering heat, according to news reports. The media had also camped outside Willow Creek’s headquarters to interview its staff, which resulted in embarrassing sound bites on the evening news.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Willow Creek acknowledged that it hadn’t trained its staff on responding to media inquiries. Over the next six months, its media relations team promoted the policy that staff should direct all inquiries to the proper channels; if confronted directly, they should politely state “no comment” and walk away.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Later that year, Willow Creek began planning a ransomware-focused operational-level tabletop exercise. When providing feedback to the development team, the executive sponsor brought up the ugly sound bites still circulating on the internet and asked that the exercise weave in the media relations education employees had recently received.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">The development team had an idea. The IT director, who had a family member in the local university’s media department, arranged to have a camera operator and reporter outside the building during the exercise. During a break, the facilitator told the attendees that a food truck was parked outside. Two attendees at a time could head to the truck to keep from overwhelming the truck’s small staff.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">After each pair of attendees placed their order at the food truck, the reporter and camera operator emerged, firing off a series of questions while pointing a microphone in the hungry attendees’ faces. “Can you comment on the ransomware outbreak? Will it impact power? Is this the nursing home fiasco all over again? The community is scared!”</span></p>&#13;
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">At the end of the exercise (and much to the audience’s dismay), the reporter and camera operator entered the room to share a few video clips. A few of the participants had responded “no comment,” as the media training had urged, but several had provided meandering answers, and at least one had answered in a way that was outright problematic. (The development team left this single problematic answer out of the public debrief to avoid embarrassment.)</span></p>&#13;
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">While it took additional effort, the activity effectively tested the success of the media training, proving the training hadn’t thoroughly mitigated the risk of employees speaking to the news. The findings were likely valid, as the exercise had simulated a stressful, real-world media encounter. Now attendees couldn’t merely say, “I wouldn’t talk to the media, because I was trained on the proper procedures.” The activity also broke up the monotony of a traditional PowerPoint-based presentation.</span></p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec12"><span id="h-97"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Attendee Tasks and Breakout Groups</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">While not appropriate for all tabletop exercises due to logistical constraints, assigning a task to a specific function could add dynamism to the event. For example, if an employee in charge of media relations states they would issue a press release within 15 minutes of an event occurring, you could request that they move to a side room to craft the statement. Assigning a <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_94" aria-label="94"/>task during a tabletop is also easy to implement during a remote exercise, as most remote presentation tools have a breakout feature; with a few clicks of the mouse, you can place certain attendees in an isolated meeting for a set duration.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">However, you must be careful to ensure that this action won’t embarrass attendees if they’re unprepared to perform the requested task. You don’t want to inhibit the fostering of relationships.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec13"><span id="h-98"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Recording Devices and Software</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Some facilitators might wonder if they should record the tabletop exercise. Recording has become easier in the post–COVID-19 world, where it’s more likely that the exercise will use remote collaboration software that lets you record meetings and save them to a sharable file with the click of a button.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">More often than not, however, recording has negative consequences. It tends to have a chilling effect on tabletop exercises, mitigating their effectiveness. Successful tabletop exercises are contingent on honest, open, and frank dialogue, and participants are less likely to contribute if they fear being recorded giving incorrect answers or going against the grain of organizational norms.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">While there may be legitimate reasons for recording a tabletop exercise (for example, if a scribe is unavailable and you’d like to revisit the responses for the eventual report), it generally isn’t recommended unless a clear benefit outweighs the potential negative effects.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec14"><span id="h-99"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Making the Most of the Exercise Space</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Over time, each facilitator learns techniques they can use during a tabletop exercise to set them up for success. Some of these techniques involve planning how you’ll use the space, such as determining the best conference room seating arrangement and how you’ll communicate with team members.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec15">&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec15"><span id="h-100"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Maximize the Conference Room Layout</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">An often-neglected facilitation technique is to use the environment to foster dialogue. If a conference room’s tables all face the front, the attendees will direct their attention toward you as the facilitator. This could be counterproductive, making attendees less likely to engage with one another.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">A better layout would be to arrange the tables in a U-shape (option 1 in <a href="#fig4-4">Figure 4-4</a>). In this arrangement, the attendees can face one another, observe one another’s body language, and direct comments toward particular attendees while making eye contact. It also enables you to easily walk into the U-shape and maintain close proximity with all attendees throughout the discussion.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Some conference rooms consist of a large round or rectangular table that can’t be split up. In these situations, it’s generally a good idea to stand opposite the displayed presentation (option 2 in <a href="#fig4-4">Figure 4-4</a>) so that <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_95" aria-label="95"/>attendees can split their attention between the front of the room (where the presentation is displayed) and the back (where you are), ensuring that there isn’t a single focal point. This type of setup also encourages more interaction among attendees.</p>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img id="fig4-4" class="img100" src="../images/pg95.jpg" alt="" width="1363" height="783"/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 4-4: Possible conference room layouts</span></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">Of course, there are various other possible room configurations. Prior to the presentation, think about which one will best encourage dialogue. Also, when selecting a location for the tabletop exercise, make sure you’re able to move the tables into an ideal layout. Booking a conference room only to find out that you’re stuck with its undesirable table layout is never a great way to start an exercise.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec16"><span id="h-101"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Work the Room to Boost Engagement</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">The most engaging speakers move around the room. Politely walking up to an attendee to ask them a question is a far more personable strategy than speaking to them from the front of the room. Doing so also offers the opportunity to direct a question to a certain person.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Sometimes the facilitator can inadvertently impair a perfectly productive conversation by sending unintended cues to the audience. For example, directly looking at an attendee while they make a comment to another attendee may make them think you want them to wrap up their point. In these cases, take a few steps back away from the attendees to physically remove yourself from the conversation until it has run its course.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Avoid standing at a lectern. Although lecterns provide cables, a microphone, a place to put a laptop, and a surface to quickly jot down notes, they may inhibit participant engagement by placing a physical barrier between you and the audience. Wireless presentation remotes enable you to advance slides and perform basic presentation tasks without having to continually return to a lectern. If you expect attendees to connect remotely, however, <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_96" aria-label="96"/>investigate the room’s audiovisual equipment, as certain systems may force you to stay near the single speakerphone.</p>&#13;

<p class="TNI">This section outlines some of the many communication strategies you could use to conduct a high-quality tabletop exercise. Some may seem like common sense; however, in the moment, it’s easy to forget the simple principles that make an event successful.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec18">&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec18"><span id="h-103"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Monitor Physiological Responses</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">For some facilitators, tabletop exercises can be highly stressful and increase breathing rate, talking speed, and perspiration. These physiological responses could distract attendees, so you should attempt to mitigate them. Prior to the exercise, take stock of any physiological responses you commonly experience when presenting and make a plan to address them should they appear. If you’re feeling especially nervous, there are a number of simple methods you could employ:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">If you’re at a logical breaking point, announce a five-minute break for attendees to refresh drinks, visit the bathroom, or tend to email.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Ask the co-facilitator to take on the next inject.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Try to consciously regulate your breathing.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Ask an attendee a question to foster a short dialogue between two participants and shift focus away from you.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">Everyone reacts to stressful situations in different ways. As the facilitator, it’s important for you to be aware of potential reactions and be able to initiate effective mitigation strategies on the fly if needed.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec19"><span id="h-104"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Set Up Backchannels</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Before the tabletop exercise, it can be helpful to set up a backchannel for communications with your trusted agent or executive sponsor so you can convey key information to each other outside the audience’s watchful eyes.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Backchannels are usually best reserved for remotely facilitated tabletop exercises, where they can consist of a side chat room. During an in-person exercise, a backchannel is more difficult to implement but not impossible; the trusted agent can send you a short message on a strategically positioned cell phone. However, you must be careful not to let that distract you from your other facilitation tasks or make it obvious that you are communicating with someone else in the room, which could be awkward in some situations.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Backchannels are often used to give the facilitator a nudge to explore a subject. For example, if you’re discussing data backup methodologies and haven’t yet discussed whether the backups are tested (a common business continuity/disaster recovery failure), the trusted agent can request that the topic be addressed. Alternatively, the backchannel could provide an <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_97" aria-label="97"/>opportunity to connect with an executive sponsor, ask them how the exercise is going, and make adjustments as necessary.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Backchannels are especially important for external consultants acting as facilitators. Lacking institutional knowledge, they could easily miss a key issue that a trusted agent would recognize. But for some facilitators, the extra mental task could detract from their ability to conduct a quality exercise.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec20"><span id="h-105"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Check in with Senior Attendees</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Attendees at a tabletop exercise represent a range of seniority. During a break, it’s prudent to check in privately with the most senior attendee to ensure that the exercise aligns with their expectations. This check-in may be as simple as saying, “I just wanted to make sure this is meeting your expectations. Is there anything we should explore further or be sure to address?” This gives the senior member an opportunity to voice any concerns or get reassurance that an issue will be addressed in a future inject. Also check in with the executive sponsor if they’re attending the tabletop exercise.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Checking in allows you to course-correct if needed and mitigates the risk that the senior member will complain about the event later. (If they do, you can politely note that they had previously provided positive feedback.) This is especially helpful if you’re external to the company, as external vendors are more likely to receive criticism.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec21">&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec21"><span id="h-106"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Manage Conversation Hogs</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">It’s not uncommon for one attendee to dominate the conversation, effectively shutting down others and harming the exercise. This person most likely isn’t trying to grandstand. Instead, their behavior is probably due to a combination of factors, including the following:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">A desire to demonstrate that they have answers to every problem</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">A lack of social skills</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">The fact that the organization’s existing processes place all responsibilities during a cybersecurity incident on one person</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">The organization’s culture of deferring to one person</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">As facilitator, you could also inadvertently encourage their behavior by failing to ask questions targeting the other attendees. There are many different strategies for mitigating the conversation monopolizer, including these:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Jokingly point out that although they have all the answers, it would be great to hear from others. Then ask a question of another attendee that doesn’t relate to the dominating employee’s skill set.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">During a break, privately but politely ask them to let other attendees carry the baton. You can frame this in a way that takes the employee’s feelings into account. For example, you could say, “You clearly know <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_98" aria-label="98"/>what to do during an incident. I would love it if we could give others a chance to step up to the plate.”</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Artificially remove them from the scenario by adding information that would make them unreachable. For example, announce that they’re now on a plane heading to meet a vendor and unable to communicate for the next two injects. Alternatively, display an image of a scuba diver, then inform them that they are now on vacation. If they tell you they’re never without their cell phone, you can respond, “You’re scuba diving off the Gal<span class="listbullet_accent">á</span>pagos Islands; your cell phone is very wet and doesn’t work.”</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">Whatever strategy you use, you should handle the situation with respect and tact. Pointing out that an individual’s behavior is borderline rude is a surefire way to alienate them, as well as other attendees.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec22"><span id="h-107"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Forge Interpersonal Connections</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Successful tabletop facilitators are able to forge interpersonal connections and make attendees feel at ease before the first inject even appears. Bonding with attendees is a challenge. Most relationships are forged over shared experiences; unfortunately, you may have only 15 minutes as attendees enter the room to develop a personal connection. For better or worse, the attention you give them during these important 15 minutes may make or break the exercise’s success. Every facilitator has their own strategy for bonding with participants. Consider these options:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Talk about the weather. It may sound boring, but it’s one of the most universal topics, whether it be a heat spell last month or an upcoming snowstorm.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Discuss sports. More than likely, some of the participants follow sports. Commenting on last night’s win, a miserable season, or a sports team logo on a participant’s lanyard is an effective way to engage them.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Bring up local culture. This may include regional activities, such as hiking at a nearby mountain or local cuisine. Asking the audience of a tabletop in Baltimore who serves the best crab cakes in town, for example, will likely generate passionate opinions.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Share details about your family. Families, relationships, and parenting are universal topics in almost any audience. Bringing up a funny story about your children or a parent’s quirkiness will almost always prompt others to share similar stories.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Discuss shared job issues. When meeting someone working in a certain role, discuss a topic that impacts both of your jobs. For example, a finance professional may be just as concerned about the fast-moving cyber insurance market as you are.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Mention cybersecurity news. The latest cybersecurity headline or zero-day exploit makes for an easy topic of interest.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">A brief, friendly conversation with a participant puts them at ease and makes them more likely to participate in the exercise.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_99" aria-label="99"/>Do not discuss potentially controversial topics, such as the current state of management at the organization, politics, foreign policy, or religion. These potentially polarizing topics are minefields that can easily offend an attendee and start the exercise on the wrong note.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec23">&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec23"><span id="h-108"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Consider the Question Structure</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">One of the facilitator’s goals is to encourage dialogue. To do so, you must be cognizant of how you structure the questions you ask attendees. Questions that require short or yes or no answers are less likely to generate discussion. Consider the following three questions that commonly emerge in a cybersecurity tabletop exercise and how you could reformat them to generate greater audience interaction:</p>&#13;
<p class="LH"><b>Question 1</b></p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL"><b>Original format:</b> Is it acceptable to shut down the local network?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL"><b>Modified format:</b> What conditions need to occur for it to be acceptable to shut down the local network?</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">The original format could elicit a yes or no answer from the audience, which would yield less discussion fodder. The modified question assumes that it is at some point acceptable to shut down the local network; to respond, participants must contemplate the conditions that play into such a decision.</p>&#13;
<p class="LH"><b>Question 2</b></p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL"><b>Original format:</b> Is this personally identifiable information?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL"><b>Modified format:</b> What is personally identifiable information? Is this it?</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">The modified format asks a compound question to foster a discussion about what qualifies as personally identifiable information.</p>&#13;
<p class="LH"><b>Question 3</b></p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL"><b>Original format:</b> Does the CISO need to know?</li>&#13;
<li class="BL"><b>Modified format:</b> What needs to happen for the CISO to be informed? And do they need to be woken up in the middle of the night?</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">In the original format, the attendees would all likely nod if the injects conveyed a set of facts that were severe enough to necessitate notifying a CISO. In the modified format, the attendees need to contemplate what conditions must exist to notify the CISO and, depending on the urgency, if those conditions are bad enough to wake a senior employee in the middle of the night.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Questions can also artificially create a discussion between two attendees. For example, if you want two employees, such as team members from information technology (Bob) and human resources (Luz), to engage with each other, you might ask, “Bob, if during the incident you discovered that an employee was using their personal email to exchange sensitive company information, which is clearly against policy, would you confront that <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_100" aria-label="100"/>employee? Luz, as the human resources focal, what is your role here? Is there a defined process? Would you want to be present when the employee is confronted?”</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">There is certainly a time and place for questions that generate short answers. However, well-structured questions can create a more interactive tabletop exercise.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec24"><span id="h-109"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Pay Attention to Nonverbal Communication</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">In their book <i>Nonverbal Communication</i> (Routledge, 2022), Burgoon, Manusov, and Guerrero state that “nonverbal cues pervade virtually every communicative act.” Nonverbal communication can include facial expressions, eye contact, proximity, posture, and other silent signals.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Give significant thought to your nonverbal communication, whether it’s maintaining eye contact with an individual or a group of attendees when asking a question, using a caring tone when pointing out a significant process deficiency, or smiling to convey a welcoming demeanor. Consider these examples of nonverbal communication and how each may promote discussion during a tabletop exercise:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">You might notice that a member of the organization’s communications team has been largely disengaged. You don’t want to publicly call them out, so instead you ask the group a question but specifically make eye contact and give a friendly smile to the disengaged attendee.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">A member of the information security team makes a particularly salient point that you believe will end up as a key recommendation. You very intentionally lean forward in your seat, furrow your eyebrows, and make eye contact with the information security team member to convey that you’re interested in the point. Without a word, you’ve indicated the point’s importance to the other attendees.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">An attendee expresses frustration about an identified process shortcoming. You place your palm on your face and groan slightly. The employee, recognizing that you understand their pain, continues to provide information.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">Seasoned facilitators use several of these nonverbal communication tactics to better engage the audience and deliver a more effective tabletop exercise.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec25"><span id="h-110"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Practice Cultural Awareness</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">In a globalized workforce, you might be conducting a tabletop exercise with participants scattered across the globe. A company’s development team may be in Australia, its manufacturing operations in Kenya, and its e-commerce team in Vietnam. Each team follows different cultural norms that could impact the tabletop exercise. If you aren’t aware of these norms, you could <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_101" aria-label="101"/>make an offensive remark that may alienate an attendee or, worse, elicit an angry response. Examples of cultural norm violations may include:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Not showing the proper deference to the attendee hierarchy and failing to introduce the most senior member first.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Criticizing a response from an attendee in an environment where criticism is rare, which might embarrass them in front of their peers.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Making statements about a government or political philosophy that could be seen as attacking a culture.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Not being aware of conflicts based on nationalism or religion and seeming out of touch.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">Prior to the tabletop exercise, take stock of where each attendee is physically located and research basic business and cultural norms. In general, if you’re unsure whether a statement may be seen as insensitive, avoid the topic.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec26">&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec26"><span id="h-111"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Identify Sensitive Topics Beforehand</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">In every organization, certain events or topics are sensitive to bring up in conversation. Identifying them is especially important for external consultants, who might not be aware of the relevant context. Examples of such minefields include the following:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Discussing shortcomings in the security operation center case management system when everyone is already aware (and frustrated) that this system has been a complete and continual failure.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Bringing up the process used to terminate employees during a conversation about insider threats when the organization recently experienced a surprise layoff.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">Prior to the tabletop exercise, ask the executive sponsor or other points of contact about topics to avoid. Keep in mind that there is a difference between asking tough questions and asking questions that betray a lack of awareness or sensitivity. When in doubt, however, consider avoiding a certain discussion point.</p>&#13;

<p class="TNI">Facilitating a tabletop exercise is much more than simply firing up a presentation and hoping for the best. Successful tabletop exercise facilitators use a range of tools and techniques, as discussed in this chapter, to craft an effective session.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">After facilitating a successful exercise, you might feel like you’ve crossed the finish line, but there are many follow-up steps to complete. These steps, discussed in the next chapter, are the most important aspects of the tabletop as they codify findings and equip the organization to make improvements after the event.</p>&#13;

<p class="TNI">Consider the following questions ahead of the facilitation process to make the event go smoothly and remove some of your burden as facilitator:</p>&#13;
<ol class="NL">&#13;
<li class="NL" value="1">Who will take notes during the exercise? Is it possible to assign a dedicated scribe? What are the scribe’s specific tasks?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">Will you ask prewritten questions?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">Will you use any facilitation aids, such as a whiteboard, polling software, or an easel? If the exercise is in person, what aids does the facility already have in place, and what will you need to procure prior to the exercise? If the exercise is remote, what tools will you leverage?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">Although doing so isn’t generally recommended, will you record the tabletop exercise? If so, do the benefits of recording outweigh its impact on attendees?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">Should you set up a communication backchannel with certain attendees, such as the executive sponsor? How will you communicate with them to avoid distracting attendees or neglecting other facilitation tasks?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">How will the conference room be laid out? Can you make changes to it prior to the exercise?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">If you’re nervous about presenting, what techniques will you use to control your physiological responses (such as speaking too fast)?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">Does the development team anticipate that any attendees will dominate the discussion? What strategies can you use to mitigate this?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">What strategies can you use to bond with attendees prior to the tabletop exercise? Have you built in time for a meet and greet?</li>&#13;

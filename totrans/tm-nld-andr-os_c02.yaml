    Android exists because the people who built it worked together previously at various

    from user interfaces to graphics to device drivers (getting the system to talk
    to hardware, like printers and displays) to the kernel (low-level system software

- en: Also, BeOS became a cult classic in operating systems. Engineers all over the
    world stumbled upon Be during college or in hobby projects and tinkered around
    with it. Be’s advanced capabilities in multimedia,^([6](#c02-footnote-6)) multiprocessing,^([7](#c02-footnote-7))
    and multithreading^([8](#c02-footnote-8)) made it an interesting playground for
    engineers interested in OS development. Many of the engineers on Android who didn’t

    for operating system development, which they later used on the Android team.

  zh: 在科技界，尤其是硅谷，这一直是一个事实：人们在公司之间流动，并在职业生涯中不断在不同的地方和背景下共同工作。当你离开公司时，永远不应该断绝关系。首先，待人得体本就是正确的做法。但在硅谷，断绝关系是一个非常糟糕的主意，因为很有可能你未来的某个时刻会需要与那些同样的人再次合作；如果当时这些桥梁没有被焚毁，那将是非常方便的。^([21](#c02-footnote-21))
- en: 'In the case of Android, it was much more than this indirect and coincidental
    effect of people ending up at the same company later on. The early team leaned
    heavily on their prior company experiences and brought in people who (a) they
    already had a working relationship with and (b) had experience working on exactly
    what Android needed: operating systems, embedded devices, and developer platforms.'

  zh: 在安卓的案例中，这远远超出了人们最终进入同一家公司这一间接且偶然的效果。早期团队在很大程度上依赖他们之前的公司经验，并招募了那些（a）他们已经有工作关系的人，以及（b）那些有着安卓所需的工作经验的人：操作系统、嵌入式设备和开发者平台。

    of colleagues who knew what they were doing, which allowed them to build this
    new OS much faster than would have otherwise been possible.

- en: Xavier Ducrohet, who joined in 2007 to work on tools, observed, “Those first
    people came from elsewhere—very few from Google. People who had shipped OSes.
    How many people have done that? They shipped small OSes and learned from their
    mistakes.”

  zh: 2007年加入安卓团队负责工具开发的 Xavier Ducrohet 观察到：“那些最早加入的人来自其他地方——很少有来自谷歌的。那些已经发布过操作系统的人。能做到这一点的人有多少？他们发布过小型操作系统，并从他们的错误中吸取了教训。”
- en: 'Dan Egnor, who also joined in 2007 to work on the over-the-air update system,
    noticed the team dynamic with the people who were there already. “There was this
    strong sense through shared history: people know each other, they know what parts
    of each other they were grumpy about, what parts they’d respect, what people could
    be trusted to accomplish, and they have clear domains of ownership. People’s names
    would roll off each other’s tongues even if they’d only been on the team a couple
    of months. People had this strong sense of knowing what other people did and how
    they did it.”'

    team, said, “Most of us had a number of failures behind us before working on Android,
    where the situation or the timing or something else wasn’t there for success.
    I count three to four failed platforms I worked on before Android. But we kept
    trying, learning from each of those failures, and using the knowledge gained from
    that to help our work on Android.”

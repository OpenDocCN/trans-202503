- en: Android, like basically every other piece of technology, is not so much the
    product and releases that ship as it is the people who built it and the collective
    experience that they brought to bear in shaping it. So the story of how Android
    (the phone OS) came to be starts much earlier than the startup, in the collective
    histories of the people on the team.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Android happened because so many other efforts happened first. Or, more precisely,
    Android exists because the people who built it worked together previously at various
    other companies, in an ever-shifting Venn diagram of mobile and desktop platform
    companies. It was at these other companies that the early Android pioneers built
    up their knowledge, skills, and collaboration with their peers. When they arrived
    on the Android team, they were able to hit the ground running and build a new
    operating system from scratch in a relatively short amount of time.

    WebTV/Microsoft, and Danger. None of them fed directly into Android, and most
    of them failed to make a large dent in the marketplace. But all of them provided
    a fertile proving ground where engineers learned critical skills that they would
    capitalize on when they later built the Android OS.

    much less used the company’s software or hardware. But Be’s impact on computing
    platforms is huge, if for no other reason than that it collected, either as employees

    Apple desktop systems. It didn’t fare well.

    (the BeBox). They ported BeOS to PC and Mac hardware and attempted selling the
    OS. They were almost acquired by Apple (in fact, they got an offer, but while
    Be’s CEO was stalling as a negotiating ploy, Steve Jobs swooped in and convinced
    Apple to buy his company, NeXT Computer, instead). In 1999, they went through
    an underwhelming initial public offering (IPO).^([4](#c02-footnote-4)) Then in
    2000, when nobody was buying Be’s hardware or OS, the company tried what the team
    called a “Focus Shift,” building an OS for an internet appliance device, which
    people also didn’t buy.

    Be and hired many of Be’s employees; Palm didn’t acquire the company, the debts,

    engineers who were interested in all aspects of operating system development,
    from user interfaces to graphics to device drivers (getting the system to talk
    to hardware, like printers and displays) to the kernel (low-level system software
    that handles the heavy-lifting for the basics that the platform needs). Working
    on these kinds of projects creates exactly the kinds of skills needed to build
    an OS like Android.

    world stumbled upon Be during college or in hobby projects and tinkered around
    with it. Be’s advanced capabilities in multimedia,^([6](#c02-footnote-6)) multiprocessing,^([7](#c02-footnote-7))
    and multithreading^([8](#c02-footnote-8)) made it an interesting playground for
    engineers interested in OS development. Many of the engineers on Android who didn’t
    actually work at Be had played around with BeOS on their own and developed a passion
    for operating system development, which they later used on the Android team.

    There, they continued working on operating systems, building Palm OS Cobalt, which
    didn’t end up shipping with any devices. Along the way, the engineering team continued
    honing their skills in OS development, while also gaining experience in mobile
    devices, which were the target of their Palm OS efforts.

    wasn’t just television, so they needed to create the software platform that ran
    on the hardware, the user interface layer to build apps, and applications for
    that platform. The team built an operating system, a UI toolkit (the system responsible
    for user interaction in applications), a programming layer for writing applications,
    and applications for an internet-enabled device. All of these efforts resulted
    in practical experience that would come in handy for the people who later found
    themselves on Android building very similar things.

    and the smartphones of the future. For example, the Hiptop offered a real web
    browser (compared to the very limited mobile browsers prevalent on phones in those
    days). Also, Danger phones had an app store, which was one of the first of its
    kind. But that store was curated by T-Mobile; carriers at that time held control
    over the applications that could run on their network, which was called the *walled
    garden.*^([19](#c02-footnote-19))

    success. The combination of internet email, messaging, and browsing, along with
    T-Mobile’s aggressive unlimited data pricing, created a phone with powerful capabilities
    for the time. Danger devices garnered a lot of attention, especially in tech^([20](#c02-footnote-20))
    and pop culture circles (including the second Hiptop device being featured in
    the 2006 film *The Devil Wears Prada*). But the phones failed to capture the minds
    and wallets of consumers. Nevertheless, these devices were important in moving
    the mobile field forward, from the technology that was created, to the new experiences
    these devices enabled, to the team of engineers that Danger educated along the
    way.

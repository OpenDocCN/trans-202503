<p class="noindentz">In <a href="ch02.xhtml">Chapters 2</a> and <a href="ch03.xhtml">3</a>, you learned how bit patterns can be used to represent data. Then, in <a href="ch04.xhtml">Chapters 4</a> to <a href="ch08.xhtml">8</a>, you learned how bits can be implemented in hardware and used to perform computations. In this chapter, I’ll explain some of the details of how instructions are encoded in bit patterns that specify the operations and the locations of the data they operate on.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The primary goal of this chapter is to give you an overall view of how computer instructions know where the data they operate on is located. The details of the machine code for each instruction are not the sort of thing that people memorize—you’ll need to consult the manual for those—but being able to interpret them has helped me to better understand and debug many of my programs during my career.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The <em>Arm Architecture Reference Manual for A-Profile Architecture</em>, available at <em><a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0487/latest">https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0487/latest</a></em>, gives an in-depth description of how each bit in a given instruction affects what the instruction does, which can be a little daunting to read. To help you learn how to read the details in the manual, I’ll cover several instructions here, adding my own explanations to the manual’s descriptions.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_228"/>As mentioned in <a href="ch10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, A64 instructions fall into three general categories:</p>&#13;
<div class="indL">&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><strong>Load and store</strong> These instructions are used to transfer data between memory and general-purpose registers.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><strong>Data processing</strong> These instructions operate on data items in registers and constants that are encoded as part of the instruction.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><strong>Program flow control</strong> These instructions are used to change the order of instruction execution from the order they are loaded into memory.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">We’ll look at a few examples of each type of instruction in this chapter.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch12lev1sec1"><strong>Looking at Machine Code</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">An <em>assembly listing</em> is a specific type of file generated by the assembler from assembly language source code that shows the machine code corresponding to each assembly language instruction. I’ll use the program in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12list1">Listing 12-1</a> to show the machine language for several instructions.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">Of course, this is a silly program—all the data is constant—but it does allow me to illustrate a few points. For example, I’ve used two different instructions, <code>mov</code> <span class="ent">❶</span> and <code>orr</code> <span class="ent">❷</span>, to copy the value in <code>w20</code> into <code>w2</code>. This will allow us to compare the machine code for two ways of accomplishing the same effect.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We can produce an assembly listing by passing the <code>-al</code> option to the assembler. This causes the assembly listing to be written to standard output, which defaults to the screen. We can capture this with the redirection operator, <code>&gt;</code>. For example, I used the command</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">The first column in the assembly listing file shows the corresponding line number in the source file. The next column shows the 16-bit relative address from the beginning of each section, in hexadecimal.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The third column gives the machine code for the instruction or data, also in hexadecimal. All A64 instructions are 32 bits wide. The assembly listing shows the 4 bytes in each instruction in the order that they’ll be stored in memory. Since ours is a little-endian environment, the 4 bytes appear backward in the assembly listing. For example, the first instruction in this program <span class="ent">❶</span> is the 32-bit word <code>0xa9827bfd</code>. (We’ll look at the other instructions that I’ve called out in this listing a bit later, in “Moving Data from Register to Register” on <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12lev2sec1">page 232</a>.)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In some cases, the names for the bit fields in my descriptions are different from those in the manual. Note that some of the names I use might have a different meaning in other places in the manual. Here are the names I’m using:</p>&#13;
<div class="indL">&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><span class="codestrong">sf</span> The size flag. The operands are 32-bit values when it’s <code>0</code> or 64-bit when it’s <code>1</code>.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><span class="codestrong">imm</span> A constant integer used by the instruction.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><span class="codestrong">hw</span> The number of halfwords (16 bits) to shift a 16-bit <code>imm</code> value left before loading it into a register.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><span class="codestrong">b_offset</span> The number of bytes from the current instruction to an address.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><span class="codestrong">b_offset:hi</span> The high-order part of a <code>b_offset</code>.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><span class="codestrong">b:lo</span> The low-order part of a <code>b_offset</code>.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><span class="codestrong">w_offset</span> The number of 32-bit words from the current instruction to an address.</p>&#13;

<p class="noindentin"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_231"/><span class="codestrong">rd</span> The number of the destination register, which will hold the result of the instruction’s operation. Where there are two destination registers, I use <code>rd1</code> and <code>rd2</code>.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><span class="codestrong">rs</span> The number of a source register, which holds a value used in the instruction’s operation. Where there are two source registers, I use <code>rs1</code> and <code>rs2</code>.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><span class="codestrong">pi</span> Tells the instruction how to treat the base register: <code>01</code> for post-index, <code>11</code> for pre-index, or <code>10</code> for don’t change.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><span class="codestrong">sh</span> Tells the instruction whether to shift an operand before using it in the operation: yes if it’s <code>1</code>, and no if it’s <code>0</code>. For a 2-bit <code>sh</code> field, <code>00</code> is <code>lsl</code>, <code>01</code> is <code>lsr</code>, <code>10</code> is <code>asr</code>, and <code>11</code> is <code>ror</code>.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><span class="codestrong">shft_amnt</span> The number of bits to shift an operand.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Bits 28 to 25 show which group the instruction is in: load and store (<code>0x4, 0x6, 0xc, 0xe</code>), data processing (<code>0x5, 0x7, 0x8, 0x9, 0xd, 0xf</code>), or program flow control (<code>0xa, 0xb</code>). Many instructions have variants. The assembler will pick the variant appropriate for the operands we use. I’ll start by showing you the load and store instructions in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12list1">Listing 12-1</a>.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch12lev1sec2"><strong>Encoding Load and Store Instructions</strong></h3>&#13;

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 12-2: A basic store instruction:</em> <span class="codeitalic">str w22, [sp, z]</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In both instructions, bit 24 is <code>1</code>, which shows us that the assembler has used the immediate, unsigned offset variant. Other variants have <code>0</code> in bit 24. Both instructions use <code>sp</code> as the base address register, giving <code>11111</code> in the <code>rb</code> field, and in both instructions the offset from the base register is the number of 32-bit words. The offset in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12list1">Listing 12-1</a> is <code>z</code>, which equates to 28. We use the number of bytes in assembly language, but the assembler divides this value by 4 to encode the number of words in the machine code for the instruction, giving 7 in the <code>w_offset</code> field.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig1">Figure 12-1</a>, the <code>0</code> in the <code>sf</code> field together with <code>00011</code> in the <code>rd</code> field tells the CPU to use <code>w3</code> for the destination register, and the <code>0</code> in the <code>sf</code> field <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_232"/>together with <code>10110</code> in the <code>rs</code> field in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig2">Figure 12-2</a> tells the CPU to use <code>w22</code> for the source register.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The stack frame is created with the <code>stp</code> instruction, shown in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig3">Figure 12-3</a>.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">Both of these instructions use <code>sp</code> for their base register. In <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig3">Figure 12-3</a>, the <code>11</code> in the <code>pi</code> field tells the CPU to subtract the <code>w_offset</code>, 4 words (32 bytes), from <code>sp</code> before (pre-index) storing the contents of registers <code>x29</code> and <code>x30</code> at that address. The CPU stores the entire 64 bits of each register because <code>sf</code> is <code>1</code>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The <code>pi</code> field is <code>01</code> in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig4">Figure 12-4</a>, so 32 is added to <code>sp</code> after (post-index) the two 64-bit values are loaded into registers <code>x29</code> and <code>x30</code>. The CPU loads 64 bits from memory into each register because <code>sf</code> is <code>1</code>. Next, I’ll explain the data processing instructions in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12list2">Listing 12-2</a>.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch12lev1sec3"><strong>Encoding Data Processing Instructions</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Data processing instructions operate on values that are already in the CPU, either in registers or as part of the instruction itself. They are used to move data or perform arithmetic and logic operations on data. In some cases, these operations overlap.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch12lev2sec1"><em><strong>Moving Data from Register to Register</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">We’ll start by looking at the instruction that moves the value from the <code>sp</code> register to the <code>fp</code> register, shown in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig5">Figure 12-5</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch12fig5" src="../images/pg260_Image_264.jpg" alt="Image" width="668" height="82"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 12-5: A basic register-to-register move instruction:</em> <span class="codeitalic">mov fp, sp</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Next, we’ll look at an instruction that uses a logical operation to effectively move a value from one register to another, shown in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig6">Figure 12-6</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_233"/><img id="ch12fig6" src="../images/pg261_Image_265.jpg" alt="Image" width="669" height="82"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 12-6: A logical operation to move data:</em> <span class="codeitalic">orr w2, wzr, w20</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notice that the <code>rs</code> field in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig5">Figure 12-5</a> is the same as the <code>rs1</code> field in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig6">Figure 12-6</a>, but in the first case it’s the code for the stack pointer and in the second it’s the zero register. This shows that the way register 31 is treated, as a stack pointer or zero register, depends on the instruction.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You’re probably wondering why I’m showing an <code>orr</code> instruction instead of a <code>mov</code> instruction in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig6">Figure 12-6</a>. As you might guess from the name, the <code>orr</code> instruction performs a bitwise OR operation between the values in the two source registers, <code>rs1</code> and <code>rs2</code>, and stores the result in the destination register, <code>rd</code>. Since <code>rs1</code> is the zero register in our instruction, this operation simply moves the value in <code>rs2</code> to <code>rd</code>, which is equivalent to <code>mov w2, w20</code> here. I’ll describe the <code>orr</code> instruction in more detail when we look at logic operators in <a href="ch16.xhtml">Chapter 16</a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The <code>mov w2, w20</code> <span class="ent">❷</span> and <code>orr w2, wzr, w20</code> <span class="ent">❸</span> instructions in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12list2">Listing 12-2</a> (on <a href="ch12.xhtml#page_229">page 229</a>) use exactly the same machine code. The two names for the same instruction are said to be <em>aliases</em>. For the instructions that have aliases, you should use the name that better expresses your intent in the algorithm. In our example program, <code>mov w2, w20</code> is a better choice.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch12lev2sec2"><em><strong>Moving a Constant to a Register</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig7">Figure 12-7</a> shows the instruction for moving a positive or unsigned constant into a register.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch12fig7" src="../images/pg261_Image_266.jpg" alt="Image" width="668" height="82"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 12-7: The instruction for moving a positive constant:</em> <span class="codeitalic">mov w19, 123</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig8">Figure 12-8</a> shows the instruction for moving a negative constant into a register.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch12fig8" src="../images/pg261_Image_267.jpg" alt="Image" width="668" height="82"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 12-8: The instruction for moving a negative constant:</em> <span class="codeitalic">mov w20, -123</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Although both instructions use the <code>mov</code> mnemonic, in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig7">Figure 12-7</a> bit 30 is <code>1</code>, and in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig8">Figure 12-8</a> it’s <code>0</code>. The difference is that the first instruction is moving a positive number and the second a negative number. When the constant in a <code>mov</code> instruction is negative, the assembler uses the <code>movn</code> (move with NOT) instruction from <a href="ch10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_234"/>In <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig7">Figure 12-7</a>, the constant +123 is encoded as <code>0x007b</code>, as we would expect, but in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig8">Figure 12-8</a> we see that –123 is encoded as <code>0x007a</code>, which is +122 in decimal.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You learned in <a href="ch03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> that in the two’s complement notation, the negative of a number can be computed by taking the complement of the number and adding 1. In other words, –123 is the complement of +122 in two’s complement notation. The <code>mov</code> instruction in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig8">Figure 12-8</a> computes the NOT of the value in the <code>imm</code> field and sign-extends it to the size of the destination register before storing the result there. So, this instruction uses the <code>0x007a</code> to store <code>0xffffff85</code> in the <code>w20</code> register, as shown in the debugger:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre">Breakpoint 1, main () at add_consts.s:24&#13;
24              str     w22, [sp, z]          // Store sum&#13;
(gdb) <span class="codestrong1">i r w19 w20 w21 w22</span>&#13;
w19            0x7b                123&#13;
w20            0xffffff85          4294967173&#13;
w21            0x0                 0&#13;
w22            0x1c8               456</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">In both instructions, the constant has to fit within the 16-bit immediate value. The range for positive numbers is 0 to +65,535, and for negative numbers it’s –1 to –65,536.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch12lev2sec3"><em><strong>Performing Arithmetic</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Let’s look at the instruction for adding a constant to a value in a register, shown in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig9">Figure 12-9</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch12fig9" src="../images/pg262_Image_268.jpg" alt="Image" width="668" height="81"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 12-9: The instruction for adding a constant to a value:</em> <span class="codeitalic">add w22, w21, 456</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This instruction adds the 12-bit <code>imm</code> value to the value in <code>rs</code> and stores the result in the <code>rd</code> register. When the shift bit, <code>sh</code>, is <code>1</code>, the <code>imm</code> value is shifted left 12 bits before performing the addition. The shift option allows us to add a 24-bit constant in two <code>add</code> operations. The first will add the low-order 12 bits and the second the high-order 12 bits.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Comparing <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig9">Figure 12-9</a> with <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig5">Figure 12-5</a>, you can see another example of an alias. If <code>imm</code> is 0 and one of <code>rd</code> or <code>rs</code> is 31, this <code>add</code> instruction is the same as a <code>mov</code> to or from the <code>sp</code> register.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch12lev2sec4"><em><strong>Computing Addresses</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Now, let’s look at the instruction that loads the address of the <code>printf</code> format string into the <code>x0</code> register, as shown in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig10">Figure 12-10</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_235"/><img id="ch12fig10" src="../images/pg263_Image_269.jpg" alt="Image" width="669" height="82"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 12-10: The instruction to load an address:</em> <span class="codeitalic">adr x0, format</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You learned in <a href="ch11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a> that this instruction computes the address of <code>format</code> by adding the offset from this instruction to <code>format</code> and the value in <code>pc</code>, then loads the result into <code>x0</code>. The <code>b_offset</code> field in this instruction shows that all 21 bits are <code>0</code> (don’t forget to include the two low-order bits in the <code>b:lo</code> field). This seems to indicate that the <code>format</code> text string is located at the same place as this instruction, which is clearly not possible. This text string is in the <code>.rodata</code> section. The linker will decide where to locate that section and fill in the <code>b_offset:hi</code> and <code>b:lo</code> fields during the linking process.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">The <code>-D</code> option dumps all the sections in the file, assumes that they all contain instructions, and disassembles them as such. I’m showing only the two sections that interest us here.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The first column shows the relative address where each instruction will be loaded into memory. The operating system will decide the base loading address when loading the program.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The second column shows the machine code of the instruction at that address. Note that <code>objdump</code> displays the machine code in 32-bit instruction order, not in the little-endian byte order we see in assembly listing files.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The linker has filled in the offset to the <code>format</code> text string in the <code>adr</code> instruction <span class="ent">❶</span>. Per <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig10">Figure 12-10</a>, the offset is <code>000000000000010110100</code>. Adding this to the relative address of the instruction gives <code>0x7a4</code> + <code>0x0b4</code> = <code>0x858</code>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The machine code at relative address <code>0x858</code> begins with the bytes <code>0x25</code>, <code>0x69</code>, <code>0x20</code>, <code>0x2b</code>, which are the code points for the first four characters in the format text string: <code>%</code>, <code>i</code>, space, and <code>+</code>. The assembly listing file, shown in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12list2">Listing 12-2</a>, displays the bytes in the proper order. Next, I’ll show you the two instructions in this program that cause program flow to go someplace other than the next instruction in memory.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch12lev1sec4"><strong>Encoding Program Flow Control Instructions</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">I’ll start with the instruction used to call the <code>printf</code> function, shown in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig11">Figure 12-11</a>.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">The <code>bl</code> instruction copies the address in <code>pc</code>, plus 4, to the link register, <code>x30</code>. It then shifts <code>w_offset</code> 2 bits to the left to give a byte offset, sign-extends it to 64 bits, and adds the result to <code>pc</code>. The result is to save the address of the instruction immediately after the <code>bl</code> instruction in memory to the link register and then transfer program flow to <code>w_offset</code> words from the address of the <code>bl</code> instruction. Since <code>w_offset</code> is 26 bits wide, the offset in bytes is limited to 28 bits, giving a transfer limit of ±128MB away in memory.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The last instruction we’ll look at is <code>ret</code>, shown in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig12">Figure 12-12</a>.</p>&#13;

</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now that you know what machine code looks like, we’ll look at how an assembler program translates assembly language into machine code. The general algorithm is similar for linking functions together; I’ll cover that too.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch12lev1sec5"><strong>Translating Assembly into Machine Code</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The presentation in this section is meant to be an overview, so it ignores most of the details. My intention is to give you only a rough idea of how an assembler translates the source code into machine language and how a linker connects the different modules that make up an entire program.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch12lev2sec6"><em><strong>The Assembler</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The simplest approach for an assembler to translate assembly language into machine code would be to go through the source one line at a time, translating each one in turn. This would work fine, except for situations where an instruction refers to a label on a line after the current line.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To see how the assembler deals with these forward references, I’ll make a forward reference to <a href="ch13.xhtml#ch13list11">Listing 13-11</a> in <a href="ch13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>, where we’ll be making use of them. <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12list3">Listing 12-3</a> shows a portion of the assembly listing file from that program.</p>&#13;

<p class="list" id="ch12list3"><em>Listing 12-3: Part of the listing file for the program in <a href="ch13.xhtml#ch13list11">Listing 13-11</a> from <a href="ch13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a></em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I’ll cover the details in <a href="ch13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>, but this section of code compares the values in registers <code>w0</code> and <code>w1</code>. If the value in <code>w1</code> is higher, the <code>b.hi</code> instruction causes the program flow to branch to the address labeled <code>tails</code>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig13">Figure 12-13</a> shows the machine code that the assembler produced for the <code>b.hi</code> instruction.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch12fig13" src="../images/pg266_Image_272.jpg" alt="Image" width="668" height="83"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 12-13: A conditional branch:</em> <span class="codeitalic">b.hi tails</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The <code>tails</code> label is at relative location <code>0x38</code>, which is <code>0x10</code> bytes beyond the <code>b.hi</code> instruction at <code>0x28</code>. In <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig13">Figure 12-13</a>, the <code>w_offset</code> is <code>0x00004</code>, or <code>0x10</code> bytes. The question is how the assembler knew the location of the forward reference to the <code>tails</code> label.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A common way to deal with forward references is to use a <em>two-pass assembler</em>, which scans the program twice. During the first pass, the assembler creates a <em>local symbol table</em>, associating each symbol with a numerical value. Those symbols defined with a <code>.equ</code> directive are entered directly in the table.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For the labeled locations in the code, the assembler needs to determine the location of each label relative to the beginning of the module being assembled and then enter that value and the label in the table. A separate local symbol table is created for each <code>.text</code> and <code>.data</code> segment in the file.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here’s the general algorithm for the first pass of a two-pass assembler, which generates a local symbol table:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre">Let location_counter = 0&#13;
do&#13;
    Read a line of source code&#13;
    if (.equ directive)&#13;
        local_symbol_table.symbol = symbol&#13;
        local_symbol_table.value = expression value&#13;
    else if (line has a label)&#13;
        local_symbol_table.symbol = label&#13;
        local_symbol_table.value = location_counter&#13;
    Determine number_of_bytes required by line when assembled&#13;
    location_counter = location_counter + number_of_bytes&#13;
while (more lines of source code)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Once the local symbol table is created, the assembler does a second pass through the source code file. It uses a built-in <em>opcode table</em> to determine the machine code, and when a symbol is used in an instruction, it looks up the value of the symbol in the local symbol table. If it does not find the symbol <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_239"/>in the local symbol table, it leaves space in the instruction for a number and records the symbol and its location in the object file.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The general algorithm looks like this:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre">Let location_counter = 0&#13;
do&#13;
    Read a line of source code&#13;
    Find machine code from opcode table&#13;
    if (symbol is used in instruction)&#13;
        if (symbol found in local_symbol_table)&#13;
            Get value of symbol&#13;
        else&#13;
            Let value = 0&#13;
            Write symbol and location_counter to object file&#13;
        Add symbol value to instruction&#13;
    Write assembled instruction to object file&#13;
    Determine number_of_bytes used by the assembled instruction&#13;
    location_counter = location_counter + number_of_bytes&#13;
while (more lines of source code)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">As an alternative, we could create a <em>one-pass assembler</em>. It would need to maintain a list of the locations of each forward reference and, when the label is found, use the table to go back and fill in the appropriate value.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Again, this is a highly simplified overview of the assembly process that is intended only to show you the general idea of how an assembler works. <a href="ch07.xhtml">Chapter 7</a> in Andrew S. Tanenbaum and Todd Austin’s <em>Structured Computer Organization</em>, 6th edition (Pearson, 2012), has a section that provides more details about the assembly process. There is a thorough discussion of the design of assembler programs in <a href="ch02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> of Leland Beck’s <em>System Software: An Introduction to Systems Programming</em>, 3rd edition (Pearson, 1997).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Most functions will have function calls, which are references to labels in <code>.text</code> segments defined in other files that cannot be resolved by the assembler. The same is true of any labels in <code>.data</code> segments, even if they’re defined in the same source code file. I’ll show you the program that resolves these references in the next section.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch12lev2sec7"><em><strong>The Linker</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The job of the linker is to figure out the relative locations of the labels in a program so it can enter the offset to each label wherever there is a reference to the label. A linker works in much the same way as an assembler, except the basic unit is a block of machine code instead of a line of assembly language. A typical program comprises many object files, each of which often has more than one <code>.text</code> segment and may have <code>.data</code> segments, all of which must be linked together. As with an assembler, two passes can be used to resolve forward references.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">An object file created by the assembler includes the size of each segment in the file, together with a list of all the global symbols and where they are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_240"/>used in the segment. During the first pass, the linker reads each object file and creates a <em>global symbol table</em> that contains the relative location of each global symbol from the beginning of the program. In the second pass, the linker creates an executable file that includes all the machine code from the object files with the relative location values from the global symbol table plugged into the locations where they are referenced.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This process resolves all the references to names defined in the modules that comprise the program, but it will leave unresolved all references to externally defined names, such as function or variable names that are defined in the C standard library. The linker enters these unresolved references into the <em>global offset table (GOT)</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If the external reference is a function call, the linker also enters this information into the <em>procedure linkage table (PLT)</em>, along with the location in the machine code where the reference is made. You can see how the linker has done this by looking at how we wrote a call to a C standard library function in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12list1">Listing 12-1</a>:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre">bl     printf</pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Using the <code>objdump</code> program to look at the contents of the executable file for this program, we see what the linker has added:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre">7a4:   97ffffab      bl     650 &lt;printf@plt&gt;</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">From the encoding of the <code>bl</code> instruction in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig11">Figure 12-11</a>, we see that the <code>w_offset</code> is the 26-bit value <code>0x3ffffab</code>. There are 4 bytes in a word, so this is equal to the 28-bit byte offset of <code>0xffffeac</code>. Adding the byte offset to the relative address of the instruction gives <code>0x00007a4</code> + <code>0xffffeac</code> = <code>0x0000650</code>. (Don’t forget that these are signed integers, so the carry from this addition is irrelevant.) This is the offset from this <code>bl</code> instruction to where the link to <code>printf</code> is located in the PLT.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When the program runs, the operating system also loads the GOT and the PLT for the program. During execution, if the program accesses an external variable, the operating system loads the library module where the variable is defined and enters its relative address in the GOT. When the program calls one of the functions in the PLT, if the function has not already been loaded, the operating system loads it, inserts its address into the program’s GOT, and adjusts the corresponding entry in the PLT accordingly.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I want to reemphasize that, as with the previous discussion of assemblers, this is only a rough overview of how linkers work. If you would like to learn more about linkers, I recommend John R. Levine’s <em>Linkers &amp; Loaders</em> (Morgan Kaufmann, 1999).</p>&#13;

<p class="noindentin"><strong>Machine code</strong> The instruction bit patterns that control the CPU.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><strong>Assembly listing</strong> The machine code corresponding to each instruction in a program, optionally generated by the assembler.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_241"/><strong>Registers</strong> The number of the register is encoded in 5 bits.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><strong>Register size</strong> A single bit encodes whether the full 64 bits or the low-order 32 bits is used.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><strong>Immediate data</strong> A constant encoded within the instruction.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><strong>Address offset</strong> The distance from the referencing instruction to a memory address, which can be encoded within the referencing instruction.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><strong>Aliases</strong> The assembler can have more than one name for some instructions, to better show the intent of using the instruction.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><strong>Assembler</strong> A program that translates assembly language to machine code and creates a global symbol table.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><strong>Linker</strong> A program that resolves cross-references between the segments in the program and creates a procedure linkage table that is used by the operating system.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">So far, all our programs have used sequential program flow and called subfunctions. In the next chapter, we’ll return to programming and you’ll learn about the other two necessary program flow constructs: repetition and two-way branching.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_242"/></p>&#13;

<p class="COS">Computer programming is a subtle art. A successful programmer needs more than knowledge of a programming language’s syntax. Getting the most out of any programming language requires a deep understanding of its <i>mechanics</i> (how the syntax elements fit together) and its <i>semantics</i> (how those elements define and control the resulting program’s behavior).</p>
<p class="TX">Semantics can be low level, such as the effects of copy-by-value behavior on equality comparisons between objects, or more conceptual, such as the application of different kinds of polymorphism. Semantics also plays a part in application design: carefully designed objects can express different concepts in a system, giving the code structure and meaning.</p>
<p class="TX">Understanding the mechanics and semantics of C# allows us to write code that makes better use of the language constructs. This comes with several potential benefits: more efficient use of memory and processor <span aria-label=" Page 288. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_288" role="doc-pagebreak"/>resources; simpler, easier-to-understand code (by other programmers as well as ourselves); and an enhanced capability to add new features and diagnose errors.</p>
<p class="TX">When designing a system, whatever its size and purpose, it’s easy to focus on the big architectural components that form the application’s overall shape. Even when a design is emergent—that is, it takes shape organically as we start creating features—the fine-grained values are easily forgotten or dismissed as the small, passive bits of data passed between the more interesting system interfaces. In this book, we’ve explored the relationship between those values and other application elements because recognizing value types as the <i>currency</i> of information in a system gives us opportunities not only to better express the overall design, but also to clarify the purpose of the code that uses them. Rich custom value types help us establish a ubiquitous language in an application that plays an important part in conveying a design and its overall purpose. They also enable the compiler to catch more errors before run time.</p>
<p class="TX">Addressing every feature of a complex language like C# in a book like this is not practical, partly because C# is an evolving language. Its features expand constantly to meet the needs of programmers in all domains. This is a Good Thing™ because the software development landscape is also continually evolving, but C# programming practitioners are responsible for keeping up with that progress. In this book, I’ve presented numerous techniques and features to help you better understand C# as it is today, and I hope I’ve also inspired you to explore the characteristics, performance, and semantics of features that the C# language designers add in the future.</p>
<p class="TX">Understanding the intricacies of C# semantics for value and value-like types can be challenging, but your effort will be rewarded with richer, clearer designs that are easier to maintain and extend. I hope this book has given you a deeper appreciation for and knowledge of the diverse facilities that C# provides for creating these types, and, most importantly, I hope it has made you a better programmer.</p>

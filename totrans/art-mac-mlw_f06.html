<p class="BodyFirst">A computer is made up of countless components, crafted by many discrete craftsmen. I’m pretty sure I’m not a computer, yet I too feel composed of unique individuals and communities. Even though there is a single name on the cover of this book, you would not be holding it in your hands today without them.</p>
<p>First and foremost, I want to acknowledge my parents, who expertly navigated the complexities of raising a child, deftly sublimating my rebellious tendencies into a creative and independent love of learning that has benefited me ever since.</p>
<p>Similarly, I am forever grateful to my older brother Keelian, who always equally challenged and inspired me. Nothing like a never-ending sibling rivalry to bring out the best in us . . . right? </p>
<p>I also want to thank my many coworkers and colleagues at the NSA and in the larger the infosec community, whose guidance and support have been invaluable over the years. Though there are far too many to name in this short section, a few, namely my close friends and colleagues Kasey, Tom, Josh, and Jon, have had a profoundly positive influence on both my personal life and career. Others, such as the brilliant Jonathan Levin and Arnaud Abbati, have always selflessly provided indispensable technical insights and mentorship, giving me both the confidence and expertise to write this book. I am lucky to count both as close friends.  </p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xx" title="xx"/>And, too, I want to personally acknowledge the many <a class="LinkURL" href="https://www.patreon.com/objective_see">patrons of Objective-See</a>, whose continued support made this book and my vision of free, open source Mac security tools a reality.</p>
<p>The companies who participate in the <a class="LinkURL" href="https://objective-see.com/friends.html">Friends of Objective-See</a> programs have also helped this book see the light of day. For that, I am forever grateful. These Friends of Objective-See include, first and foremost:</p>

<p>Last, but certainly not the least, are the many individuals who worked directly on the book. These delightful (and, yes, sometimes strict) humans kept me roughly on schedule to bring this book to fruition. First, a big mahalo to Runa Sandvik for her invaluable input and editing skills on the initial draft of this book. Also, my good friend Tom McGuire (Tmac), who put countless hours into the rather thankless job of technical editor. Finally, a big thank you to the incredibly professional and hardworking crew at No Starch Press, including founder Bill Pollock and the book’s main editor, Frances Saux. </p>

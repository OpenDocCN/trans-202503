- en: Lauren Ipsum had been lost in the woods all morning. The poor girl didn’t know
    where she was or where she was going.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It had all started with an argument. Her mother wanted her to go to summer school,
    and naturally Laurie didn’t want to go. “Children in other countries go to school
    year round,” her mom said. “We aren’t in other countries,” Laurie replied. “Extra
    classes are how to get ahead,” Mom said. “Summer is for having fun,” Laurie insisted.
    The argument went on and on and got loud near the end. To calm down, Laurie took
    a walk in the woods.

    they aren’t allowed to do instead. Before long, Laurie had gone farther into the
    woods than she had ever gone before.
  prefs: []

    be, and there was no one to tell her different.

- en: She was a secret ninja, moving like a ghost through the ancient forest. Light
    and shadow danced under the leaves, and she danced with them. No one could hear
    her stealthy ninja footsteps. No one would see her coming until it was too—

    Was it an angry spirit? A dire beast?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “*Argot!*” the creature said. It was like a mouse-dog, or a dog-mouse. That
    is to say, it was the size of a dog, but it looked more like a mouse. It walked
    right up to Laurie and began nuzzling her hand in a very un-beast-like way.

    She offered it some peanuts.

    something about moss growing on the north side of trees. There wasn’t any moss,
    so that was out. *The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.* It was late
    morning, and the sun was almost overhead. No help there either.'

    heads, she walked to the left for a while. If it landed on tails, she walked to
    the right for a while.

    to follow Laurie all the way to . . . wherever she was going.

    It tried to lick her face.

    her, pushing and shouting. She was being mobbed.

    she was too afraid to slow down.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Her escape was blocked by a tall green hedge that stretched in both directions.
    Once upon a time it might have been part of a garden, but now it was wild and
    disorderly. Laurie squeezed her way through a gap in the hedge and kept running
    until she thought she was safe. The creatures were far behind.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The forest looked different on the other side of the hedge. For one, the trees
    had red and black stripes. Black tree trunks split into two red branches. Those
    split into four black branches, which split into eight red branches, and on and
    on, until the branches ended in millions of tiny black leaves. In fact . . .

    and pots and pans and cowbells rattled around. The creatures halted a few paces
    away, making awful, angry noises.

    with a loud jangle, then sat on top of it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    they’ll settle for fear and confusion.”
  prefs: []

    following me.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    people even keep them as pets. But they form packs, and they are very dangerous.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “That’s terrible!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    any fear, a pack of wild Jargon will run you right over.”

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    name, miss?”

  prefs: []

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    *are*,” she said, “and you know where you’re *going*, how can you be lost?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Because I don’t know how I’ll get there,” the man grinned. “I’m a Wandering
    Salesman.”
  prefs: []

  prefs: []

  prefs: []

    logical. Along the way I’ve seen the sunrise over the Towers of Hanoi and climbed
    the Upper Bounds. I’ve sat down at the Lookup Table and floated on the Overflow
    River. It’s a good life. Being lost can be fun!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    or where I’m going, *or* how to get there.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    too, right?”

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    where *you* are. You are in the Red-Black Forest, near Mile Zero.”

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Right. I can take you up to the road, but from there you are on your own.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the last tree was a road sign. “Ah, here we are,” he said. “Route One, Mile Zero.”

  prefs: []

  prefs: []

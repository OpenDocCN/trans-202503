<p class="tx">In this part of the book, you’ll learn about pseudo-environment variables, writing reports, recursion, text searches, automatic restarts, and bat files that build other bat files. Other topics will delve into conditional execution (again), arrays, hash tables, and testing and troubleshooting. I’ll finish up with object-oriented design and an application of it in the form of data structures called stacks and queues. Many of these topics weren’t envisioned by the creators of Batch. That hasn’t stopped us before and won’t stop us in the following chapters.</p>

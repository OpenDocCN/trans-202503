<p class="BodyFirst">The title of Colleen M. Farrelly and Yaé Ulrich Gaba’s book, <em>The Shape of Data</em>, is as fitting and beautiful as the journey that the authors invite us to experience, as we discover the geometric shapes that paint the deeper meaning of our analytical data insights.</p>
<p>Enabling and combining common machine learning, data science, and statistical solutions, including the combinations of supervised/unsupervised or deep learning methods, by leveraging topological and geometric data analysis provides new insights into the underlying data problem. It reminds us of our responsibilities as data scientists, that with any algorithmic approach a certain data bias can greatly skew our expected results. As an example, the data scientist needs to understand the underlying data context well to avoid performing a two-dimensional Euclidean-based distance analysis when the underlying data needs to account for three-dimensional nuances, such as what a routing analysis would require when traveling the globe.</p>
<p>Throughout the book’s mathematical data analytics tour, we encounter the origin of data analysis on structured data and the many seemingly unstructured data scenarios that can be turned into structured data, which enables standard machine learning algorithms to perform predictive and prescriptive analytical insights. As we ride through the valleys and peaks of our data, we learn to collect features along the way that become key inputs into other data layers, forming geometrical interpretations of varying unstructured data sources including network data, images, and text-based data. In addition, Farrelly and Gaba are masterful in detailing the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xvi" title="xvi"/>foundational and advanced concepts supported by the well-defined examples in both R and Python, available for download from their book’s web page.</p>
<p>Throughout my opportunities to collaborate with Farrelly and Gaba on several exciting projects over the past years, I always hoped for a book to emerge that would explain as clearly and eloquently as <em>The Shape of Data</em> does the evolution of the topological data analysis space all the way to leveraging distributed and quantum computing solutions.</p>
<p>During my days as a CTO at Cypher Genomics, Farrelly was leading our initiatives in genomic data analytics. She immediately inspired me with her keen understanding of how best to establish correlations between disease ontologies versus symptom ontologies, while also using simulations to understand the implications of missing links in the map. Farrelly’s pragmatic approach helped us successfully resolve critical issues by creating an algorithm that mapped across gene, symptom, and disease ontologies in order to predict disease from gene or symptom data. Her focus on topology-based network mining for diagnostics helped us define the underlying data network shape, properties, and link distributions using graph summaries and statistical testing. Our combined efforts around ontology mapping, graph-based prediction, and network mining and decomposition resulted in critical data network discoveries related to metabolomics, proteomics, gene regulatory networks, patient similarity networks, and variable correlation networks.</p>
<p>From our joint genomics and related life sciences analytics days to our most recent quantum computing initiatives, Farrelly and Gaba have consistently demonstrated a strong passion and unique understanding of all the related complexities and how to apply their insights to several everyday problems. Joining them on their shape of data journey will be valuable time spent as you embark on a well-scripted adventure of R and Python algorithms that solve general or niche problems in machine learning and data analysis using geometric patterns to help shape the desired results.</p>
<p>This book will be relevant and captivating to beginners and devoted experts alike. First-time travelers will find it easy to dive into algorithm examples designed for analyzing network data, including social and geographic networks, as well as local and global metrics, to understand network structure and the role of individuals in the network. The discussion covers clustering methods developed for use on network data, link prediction algorithms to suggest new edges in a network, and tools for understanding how, for example, processes or epidemics spread through networks.</p>
<p>Advanced readers will find it intriguing to dive into recently developing topics such as replacing linear algebra with nonlinear algebra in machine learning algorithms and exterior calculus to quantity needs in disaster planning. <em>The Shape of Data</em> has made me want to roll up my sleeves and dive into many new challenges, because I feel as well equipped as Lara Croft in <em>Tomb Raider</em> thanks to Farrelly’s tremendous treasure map and deeply insightful exploration work. Could there be a hidden bond or “hidden layer” between them?</p>

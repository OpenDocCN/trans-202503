<p class="noindentt1">This is not your typical beginner design book.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Beginner books tend to assume you eventually want to become an expert. Programming books assume you want to get a job in programming or computer engineering; design books assume you want to become a full-fledged designer.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">But what if you wanted to learn <em>just enough</em> design to enhance your existing career?</p>
<p class="noindentt1">I believe in the power of improving your skill set beyond your current focus. My personal experiences don’t fit into any single category — I have a degree in Art &amp; Design, I develop websites and apps using Python, and I have founded and managed a start-up. Knowing just enough in many areas has been crucial for my career.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Just as designers benefit from learning a little bit about programming, programmers (and marketers, and product managers, salesfolk, and so on) can benefit from learning a little bit about design. Even if you don’t specialize in design, you will need to design at some point — whether it’s working on slide decks, creating interfaces for programs and projects, or building a personal website. If you work with designers, a bit of design experience will give you a better foundation for communicating with them and understanding their work.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">The purpose of <em>Hello Web Design</em> isn’t to make you a designer — it’s here to make you feel more comfortable doing design.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">This book focuses solely on the visual stuff: you’ll find no <span class="small">HTML</span>, <span class="small">CSS</span>, or frontend development and code within. We’re <a id="page_xviii"/>going to work on making your designs feel more beautiful and, almost more important, how to make them <em>work</em> better.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Design is about problem solving. Even in places where you feel like you’re just making things “prettier” (like working on a slide deck), you’re really working to make the information in your slide deck easier and more pleasurable to read and comprehend. In our web interfaces, we really want to make things feel more natural and easier to use — good design is crucial to capturing and keeping new users and improving how successful our designs are.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Throughout this book, we’ll explore not only theory (and the reasons behind some of those principles) but also shortcuts and quick solutions to some common design problems. For example, I’ll share a bit about color theory but also some resources that will help you choose great-looking color palettes without starting from scratch. That pattern will repeat throughout the book — lots of shortcuts and some insight into why the shortcuts work.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">My hope is that you’ll feel more confident in doing design by the end of the book and then jump into more traditional beginner books covering design theory and practices more thoroughly if you want to become a traditional designer. Or, you can just use this book to benefit your current career. In either case, you’ll be a much stronger designer by the end of this little book.</p>

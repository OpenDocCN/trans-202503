<div class="imagel"><img alt="Image" src="../images/common.jpg"/></div>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes you’ll want to reuse a section of code to complete a specific task you’ve completed before. In these situations, you can define or create a <em>procedure</em> that includes those lines of code, and then give that procedure a unique name.</p>
<p class="indent">This way, whenever you want to execute that task, you can call the procedure by name instead of writing the same lines of code over and over again. This also means that when you have to correct something in that code, you only have to fix the code inside the procedure once.</p>
<p class="indent">In this chapter, you’ll learn how to create procedures in App Inventor and use them to make the “Multiplication Station II” app. As you’ll see, procedures not only help you avoid repeating the same code, they also make long and complicated code more organized and easier to read.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec46"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_126"/><strong>PROCEDURES CAN TAKE PARAMETERS</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s use a simple example to see how procedures work. Say you’ve written code that calculates how many days there are until someone’s birthday. You can use those lines of code to create a procedure and give it a name like <code>BdayCountDown</code>. Now, whenever you need to count down to someone’s birthday, all you have to do is <em>call</em> the <code>BdayCountDown</code> procedure. Pretty handy!</p>
<p class="indent">Like the built-in methods we’ve used in some of our apps, a procedure might require <em>parameters</em> that you’ll have to declare and name when defining the procedure itself. In the birthday example, the <code>BdayCountDown</code> procedure would take a person’s birth month and day as parameters to calculate the result. This means that when calling <code>BdayCountDown</code>, you’ll need to provide the <em>arguments</em> that the procedure needs to complete that task. In this case, the procedure would take numbers (for the date of birth) as its arguments.</p>
<p class="indent">Since the arguments passed into the procedure at each call may be different, a procedure might produce a different result every time you call it. This makes sense in the birthday example, too: since most people have different birthdays, the procedure would return different values.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec47"><strong>CREATING YOUR OWN PROCEDURE</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">You’ve already used several of App Inventor’s built-in procedures, both with and without parameters. For instance, in “Hi, World!” in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1</a>, you used the call to the built-in <code>SpeechRecognizer.GetText</code> method to convert spoken messages to text. And in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3</a>’s “Fruit Loot” app, you moved the <code>ImageSprite</code>s around the <code>Canvas</code> using the <code>ImageSprite.Move</code> method call, which required x- and y-coordinates as parameters.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to built-in methods, App Inventor provides blocks that let you create your own procedures, which can return results or not and can have numerous parameters or none at all. Once you create a procedure with its own unique name, App Inventor creates a block just for that procedure that you can use to call it, complete with sockets to plug in any parameter arguments. You’ll find the call block in the Procedures blocks drawer.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s try creating our own procedures to change the code in some of the apps we’ve already made. We’ll refactor the code in “Fruit Loot” so that we don’t repeat the same blocks in the three <code>EdgeReached</code> event handlers that tell the app what to do after each fruit <code>ImageSprite</code> reaches the edge of the <code>Canvas</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">The following code shows the <code>EdgeReached</code> event handlers we coded in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">As you can see, we duplicated blocks to create the three separate <code>EdgeReached</code> event handlers for <code>FruitSprite1</code>, <code>FruitSprite2</code>, and <code>FruitSprite3</code>. In each copy, we changed only the few blocks that set the <code>ImageSprite</code>’s <code>X</code> property to make sure that the fruit <code>ImageSprite</code>s never collide with each other as they fall down the <code>Canvas</code>.</p>
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_127"/><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0127-01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indent">Now compare this with the following code, which shows a <code>backToTop</code> procedure that completes the same tasks, but uses a lot fewer blocks if we call it within the event handlers for all three fruit <code>ImageSprite</code>s.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0127-02.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_128"/>To create the <code>backToTop</code> procedure, we’ll need to define the parameters <code>sprite</code> and <code>X</code>, which are the two pieces of information that may change each time the procedure is called—the <code>ImageSprite</code> to adjust and the x-coordinate for the point at the top of the screen where we want to move that <code>ImageSprite</code>.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2sec46"><strong>DEFINING THE PARAMETERS</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Log into App Inventor, and open your “Fruit Loot” app by selecting <strong>Projects</strong> <span class="ent">▸</span> <strong>My Projects</strong> and choosing the “Fruit Loot” app from your list of projects.</p>
<p class="indent">Go to the Blocks Editor and click the <strong>Procedures</strong> blocks drawer in the Blocks pane. Drag the <span class="codestrong">to procedure do</span> block to the Viewer, click <span class="codestrong">procedure</span>, and rename it by entering <span class="codestrong">backToTop</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">Then click the blue mutator icon to the left of the words <code>to backToTop</code>, drag two <span class="codestrong">input:x</span> blocks to the <span class="codestrong">inputs</span> block in the dialog that opens, and rename them <span class="codestrong">input:sprite</span> and <span class="codestrong">input:X</span>. Your inputs should look like <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch7fig1">Figure 7-1</a>. Once the mutator dialog closes, you also should see the parameters <code>sprite</code> and <code>X</code> listed to the right of the words <code>to backToTop</code> in the <code>to backToTop</code> block, as shown in the previous code.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch7fig1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/07fig01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 7-1: The blocks that add the parameters for the <code>backToTop</code> procedure</em></p>
<p class="indent">Now we can program <code>backToTop</code> so that it can have the app execute the exact same commands that we coded in each of the original <code>EdgeReached</code> handlers. But instead of using blocks for a specific <code>ImageSprite</code>, we’ll use the generic Any <code>ImageSprite</code> setter blocks. That way, each time we call the procedure, the setter blocks will make changes to the <code>ImageSprite</code> referred to in the procedure’s <code>sprite</code> parameter, which will be the <code>ImageSprite</code> that hit the edge.</p>
<p class="indent">To add the setter blocks, click the plus sign to the left of the Any Component category listing at the bottom of the Blocks pane and then click the <strong>Any ImageSprite</strong> drawer, drag the <span class="codestrong">setImageSprite.Enabled</span> block to the Viewer, and make three copies of it. You should now have four copies of the <code>set ImageSprite.Enabled</code> block on the Viewer. You’ll use these to set the <code>ImageSprite</code>’s <code>Y</code>, <code>X</code>, <code>Picture</code>, and <code>Visible</code> properties as shown earlier.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev3sec87"><strong>Setting the ImageSprite’s Y and X Properties</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">We’ll start by setting the given <code>ImageSprite</code>’s <code>Y</code> and <code>X</code> properties to make the <code>ImageSprite</code> return to a random spot at the top of the screen before dropping again.</p>
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_129"/><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0129-01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indent">These blocks first take the <code>Y</code> property of the <code>ImageSprite</code> that is given as the argument for the <code>sprite</code> parameter in the <code>backToTop</code> procedure call (the <code>ImageSprite</code> that dropped and hit the edge) and set it to <code>0</code>. This moves the <code>ImageSprite</code> back up to the top of the screen. Drag the first copy of the <span class="codestrong">setImageSprite.Enabled</span> block <span class="ent">➊</span> inside the <span class="codestrong">to backToTop</span> procedure block next to the word <code>do</code>, click the drop-down arrow to the right of the word <code>Enabled</code>, and replace <span class="codestrong">Enabled</span> by selecting <span class="codestrong">Y</span>. Then mouse over the procedure’s <span class="codestrong">sprite</span> parameter and drag its <span class="codestrong">get sprite</span> block <span class="ent">➋</span> into the <span class="codestrong">setImageSprite.Y</span> block’s first socket. Drag the number <span class="codestrong">0</span> block <span class="ent">➌</span> from the <span class="codestrong">Y</span> property setter block in the original <span class="codestrong">FruitSprite1 EdgeReached</span> handler into the second socket.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, we’ll add blocks that set the given <code>ImageSprite</code>’s <code>X</code> property to the given random <code>X</code> value, which moves the <code>ImageSprite</code> to a random spot at the top of the screen. To do this, drag the second <span class="codestrong">setImageSprite.Enabled</span> block <span class="ent">➍</span> into the procedure block under the <span class="codestrong">setImageSprite.Y</span> block, and replace <span class="codestrong">Enabled</span> by selecting <span class="codestrong">X</span> in the drop-down. Drag another <span class="codestrong">get sprite</span> block <span class="ent">➎</span> into the <span class="codestrong">setImageSprite.X</span> block’s first socket, mouse over the procedure’s <span class="codestrong">X</span> parameter, and drag its <span class="codestrong">get X</span> block <span class="ent">➏</span> into the second socket.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev3sec88"><strong>Setting the ImageSprite’s Picture and Visible Properties and Adding to fruitsDropped</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">Next, we’ll add blocks that set the given <code>ImageSprite</code>’s new <code>Picture</code> and <code>Visible</code> properties and increment the value of the <code>fruitsDropped</code> variable.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0129-02.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indent">First, we’ll place the blocks that set the given <code>ImageSprite</code>’s <code>Picture</code> property randomly to <em>1.png</em>, <em>2.png</em>, or <em>3.png</em>, each of which is a picture of a different piece of fruit. This ensures that players won’t know whether an apple, lemon, or orange will drop next. To do this, drag the third <span class="codestrong">setImageSprite.Enabled</span> block <span class="ent">➊</span> into the procedure block under the <span class="codestrong">setImageSprite.X</span> block, and replace <span class="codestrong">Enabled</span> by selecting <span class="codestrong">Picture</span> in the drop-down. Drag another <span class="codestrong">get sprite</span> block <span class="ent">➋</span> into its first socket, and drag the <span class="codestrong">join</span> block <span class="ent">➌</span> from the <code>Picture</code> setter block in the original <code>EdgeReached</code> handler into the second socket.</p>
<p class="indent">Then, we’ll add another set of blocks to make the given <code>ImageSprite</code> visible in case it hit the picker earlier and disappeared. Drag the fourth <span class="codestrong">setImageSprite.Enabled</span> block <span class="ent">➍</span> into the procedure block under the <span class="codestrong">setImageSprite.Picture</span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_130"/>block, and replace <span class="codestrong">Enabled</span> by selecting <span class="codestrong">Visible</span> in the drop-down menu. Drag another <span class="codestrong">get sprite</span> block <span class="ent">➎</span> into its first socket, and drag the <span class="codestrong">true</span> block <span class="ent">➏</span> from the <code>Visible</code> setter block in the original <code>EdgeReached</code> handler into the second socket.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, to complete the <code>backToTop</code> procedure, we’ll add blocks that increment the value of the <code>fruitsDropped</code> variable by 1 when the procedure is called. This will enable us to keep track of the total number of pieces of fruit dropped in the game. To do this, drag the <span class="codestrong">set global fruitsDropped</span> blocks <span class="ent">➐</span> from the original <code>EdgeReached</code> handler into the procedure block under the <code>setImageSprite.Visible</code> block.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2sec47"><strong>CALLING THE PROCEDURE</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">With this procedure in place, we no longer need to add the five setter blocks to each <code>EdgeReached</code> event handler.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0130-01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indent">We can handle the <code>EdgeReached</code> event for each fruit <code>ImageSprite</code> simply by snapping the <code>call backToTop</code> block <span class="ent">➊</span> from the Procedures drawer inside each <code>ImageSprite</code>’s <code>EdgeReached</code> event handler.</p>
<p class="indent">We can then click the <span class="codestrong">ImageSprite</span> in the Blocks pane; drag the very last block, its getter block <span class="ent">➋</span>, into the <span class="codestrong">call backToTop sprite</span> socket to provide the argument for the <code>sprite</code> parameter; and drag the random integer blocks <span class="ent">➌</span> from the <span class="codestrong">X</span> setter block in its original <code>EdgeReached</code> handler into the <span class="codestrong">call backToTop X</span> socket to provide the argument for the <code>X</code> parameter. Once you add the call block to the <code>EdgeReached</code> handler for each <code>ImageSprite</code> and fill the parameter sockets as described, be sure to delete the five original setter blocks from all three <code>EdgeReached</code> event handlers.</p>
<p class="indent">Now we can use the <code>backToTop</code> procedure not just in the “Fruit Loot” game, but in any other similar game. Since we’ve created this procedure here, we never have to figure out again how to keep moving randomly dropping, non-colliding images back to the top of a screen to drop again, whether they’re images of balls, birds, or anything else.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec48"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_131"/><strong>BUILDING THE “MULTIPLICATION STATION II” APP</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Let’s define another multiparameter procedure to build on the original “Multiplication Station” app from <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4</a>. When we’re done, users should be able to select from two difficulty levels of multiplication problems. We’ll also rework the user interface of the app’s welcome screen, create new global list variables to present choices, and include an <code>if then</code> block to tell the app what to display when a user selects each level of practice problems.</p>
<p class="indent">To get started, open your original “Multiplication Station” app by selecting <strong>Projects</strong> <span class="ent">▸</span> <strong>My Projects</strong>, as shown in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch7fig2">Figure 7-2</a>, and choosing the “Multiplication Station” app from your list of projects.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch7fig2"><img alt="Image" src="../images/07fig02.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 7-2: The Projects menu where you open and save projects</em></p>
<p class="indent">Once “Multiplication Station” opens, select <strong>Projects</strong> <span class="ent">▸</span> <strong>Save project as…</strong> and rename the project by entering <span class="codestrong">MultiplicationStationII</span> without any spaces, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2sec48"><strong>DECOMPOSING “MULTIPLICATION STATION II”</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">We want to change the original “Multiplication Station” app so that when users open the app, they can choose level 1 (easier) or level 2 (more challenging) problems to practice and will have more time to solve level 2 problems.</p>
<p class="indent">We can decompose the new action for “Multiplication Station II” into three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p class="noindent">When the user opens the app, play a welcome message. Display the <code>ListPicker</code> for the user to click to choose a practice level.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent">After the user clicks the <code>ListPicker</code> to choose a practice level, play another message stating the number of seconds available to answer each problem. Open and pass the selected problem level to the practice screen.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent">When the <code>Clock</code>’s timer fires, display a random multiplication problem at the correct time interval for the selected problem level.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_132"/>You’ll need the following new components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="noindent"><span class="codestrong">ListPicker</span> for the user to click to select problem level and open the practice screen (this replaces the original start button on the welcome screen)</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent">Procedure to display problems and set the <code>Clock</code> timer interval according to the selected problem level</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent">Variable (2) to store problem level and timer interval</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2sec49"><strong>LAYING OUT “MULTIPLICATION STATION II” IN THE DESIGNER</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Right now, the welcome screen gives users only one option—to click the start button and start practicing. To allow users to first choose the level of multiplication problems, all we have to do is remove <code>Button1</code> from the welcome screen and replace it with a <code>ListPicker</code>. Once we adjust the <code>ListPicker</code>’s properties to make it look similar to <code>Button1</code>, the new welcome screen should look something like <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch7fig3">Figure 7-3</a>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch7fig3"><img alt="Image" src="../images/07fig03.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 7-3: The Viewer, Component, and Media panes showing the <code>Screen1</code> layout for “Multiplication Station II”</em></p>
<p class="indent">To make these changes, first go to the Designer for <code>Screen1</code>. Click <span class="codestrong">Button1</span> in the Components pane, and click <strong>Delete</strong> and then <strong>Delete</strong> again in the dialog that opens.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_133"/>Now drag a <span class="codestrong">ListPicker</span> from the User Interface drawer and place it on the Viewer where you just deleted <code>Button1</code>. Adjust the <code>ListPicker</code>’s properties so that it looks like <code>Button1</code>. In the Properties pane, change the background color to black by clicking <strong>Default</strong> under <span class="codestrong">BackgroundColor</span> and then clicking <strong>Black</strong> when the color list dialog opens. Make its text bold by clicking the checkbox under <span class="codestrong">FontBold</span>, and change its shape by clicking the drop-down arrow under <strong>Shape</strong> and selecting <strong>rounded</strong>.</p>
<p class="indent">Next, enter <span class="codestrong">Choose Your Level</span> in the text box under <strong>Text</strong> so users know to click the <code>ListPicker</code> to choose their problem level. Then, center the text by clicking the drop-down arrow under <span class="codestrong">TextAlignment</span> and selecting <strong>center: 1</strong>, and make the text white by clicking <strong>Default</strong> under <span class="codestrong">TextColor</span> and then clicking <strong>White</strong> when the color list dialog opens. <code>Screen1</code> should now look like <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch7fig3">Figure 7-3</a> in the Viewer.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec49"><strong>PROGRAMMING “MULTIPLICATION STATION II”</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Now let’s program the new features for “Multiplication Station II” following the steps outlined earlier. To show the correct problems for the selected problem level, we’ll create two new list variables and a procedure with parameters. We’ll add an <code>if then</code> block to the procedure so that the app will know whether to display problems for level 1 or level 2 at each <code>Clock</code> timer interval.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll also program two new event handlers so that the app will know what to do before and after the user selects a level with the <code>ListPicker</code>. To begin programming, click the <strong>Blocks</strong> button to switch to the Blocks Editor and make sure you’re on <code>Screen1</code>.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2sec50"><strong>STEP 1: SETTING PROBLEM LEVEL CHOICES AND PLAYING THE NEW WELCOME MESSAGE</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">As soon as the screen opens, we want to display the <code>ListPicker</code> with the problem level options for the user to select. We’ll prompt the user to select a practice problem level by playing the app’s welcome message.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev3sec89"><strong>Creating the Global level and seconds List Variables</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">We’ll use two global list variables in this step: <code>level</code>, which stores the two problem level choices for <code>ListPicker1</code>, and <code>seconds</code>, which holds the number of seconds available to solve problems in each level. Create the two lists with the blocks shown here.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0133-01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indent">To create each variable, click the <strong>Variables</strong> block drawer and drag an <span class="codestrong">initialize global name</span> block <span class="ent">➊</span> to the Viewer, click <span class="codestrong">name</span>, and replace it with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_134"/>the variable name (in this case, <span class="codestrong">level</span> and <span class="codestrong">seconds</span>). Then drag a <span class="codestrong">make a list</span> block <span class="ent">➋</span> from the Lists drawer and snap it to the right side of the <span class="codestrong">initialize global</span> block. Finally, drag two <span class="codestrong">0</span> number blocks <span class="ent">➌</span> from the Math drawer and snap them into the sockets of the <span class="codestrong">make a list</span> block. Then, replace the <span class="codestrong">0</span> in each number block with <span class="codestrong">1</span> and <span class="codestrong">2</span> in <span class="codestrong">level</span> for the two possible problem levels and <span class="codestrong">5</span> and <span class="codestrong">10</span> in <span class="codestrong">seconds</span> for the number of seconds available for each level.</p>
<p class="indent">The items we’ve placed in the same index position in the two variables correspond to each other. This means that we can see how many seconds are available to solve problems for each level by looking at the items that are placed in the same position in the <code>level</code> and <code>seconds</code> variables. Here you can see that there are 5 seconds available for level 1 problems, and 10 seconds available for level 2.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev3sec90"><strong>Programming the Welcome Screen Event Handlers</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">Now we can start coding the app’s response to the two events in this step: the <code>ListPicker BeforePicking</code> and the <code>ScreenInitialize</code> events. This is where we want to set the problem level choices for the <code>ListPicker</code> and play the welcome message.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0134-01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indent">Having created <code>level</code>, we have the data we need to set <code>ListPicker1</code>’s choices. Before the user selects from <code>ListPicker1</code>, we need to set those choices to the items in the <code>level</code> list so users can choose between level 1 and level 2. We’ll program this action with the <code>ListPicker BeforePicking</code> event handler.</p>
<p class="indent">In the Blocks pane, click <span class="codestrong">ListPicker1</span> and drag the <span class="codestrong">whenListPicker1.BeforePicking</span> event handler block <span class="ent">➊</span> to the Viewer. Then, click <span class="codestrong">ListPicker1</span> again and drag its <span class="codestrong">setListPicker.Elementsto</span> block <span class="ent">➋</span> into the <span class="codestrong">whenListPicker1.BeforePicking</span> block next to the word <code>do</code>. Next, in the Blocks pane, click the <strong>Variables</strong> blocks drawer, drag the <span class="codestrong">get global level</span> block <span class="ent">➌</span> in, and snap it to the right of the <span class="codestrong">setListPicker1.Elementsto</span> block. These three blocks create the <code>BeforePicking</code> event handler, which sets the problem level choices that the user will see when clicking <code>ListPicker1</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, for the <code>whenScreen1.Initialize</code> event handler, which we already dragged to the Viewer for the original “Multiplication Station” app, we can leave all blocks the same, except for the string block that holds the argument for the <code>message</code> parameter of the <code>callTextToSpeech1.Speak</code> block. In that string block <span class="ent">➍</span>, change the text to read <span class="codestrong">Welcome to Multiplication Station! Choose your problem level to begin practicing.</span> so users will hear that message when the app opens.</p>
<p class="indent">Live-test these event handlers with a device. When your “Multiplication Station II” app opens on your device, you should hear the welcome message. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_135"/>You also should see the Choose Your Level button on the screen, and when you click it, you should see the two choices, 1 and 2. Right now, if you try to select either choice, nothing should happen. We’ll program that <code>AfterPicking</code> action next.</p>
<p class="indent">If the app’s not working as described, debug and make sure you’ve created and placed your blocks correctly. When everything’s working, leave the app open on your device to keep live-testing.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2sec51"><strong>STEP 2: STATING THE NUMBER OF SECONDS FOR EACH PROBLEM AND OPENING THE PRACTICE SCREEN</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s use the <code>ListPicker AfterPicking</code> event to tell users how many seconds they have to answer each problem, depending on the level they selected. Then we’ll program the app to open the practice screen and transfer the value of the selected problem level to that screen. Here are the blocks that direct this action.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0135-01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indent">Let’s first program the app to speak after the user chooses a problem level.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev3sec91"><strong>Telling the User the Time Limit</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">In the Blocks pane, click <span class="codestrong">ListPicker1</span> and drag the <span class="codestrong">whenListPicker1.AfterPicking</span> event handler block <span class="ent">➊</span> to the Viewer. Then, click <span class="codestrong">TextToSpeech1</span> and drag its <span class="codestrong">callTexttoSpeech1.Speak</span> block <span class="ent">➋</span> into the <span class="codestrong">whenListPicker1.AfterPicking</span> block next to the word <code>do</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">Next, to provide the argument for the <code>callTexttoSpeech1.Speak</code> block’s <code>message</code> parameter so the app will know what to say, drag a <span class="codestrong">join</span> block <span class="ent">➌</span> from the Text blocks drawer to the Viewer. Then add another string input to the <span class="codestrong">join</span> block and snap it to the right of the <span class="codestrong">callTexttoSpeech1.Speak</span> block next to the word <code>message</code>. This lets us join three strings together to form the <code>message</code> for <code>TextToSpeech1</code>. If the user selected problem level 1, we fill the <code>join</code> block’s inputs to set the <code>message</code> to <span class="codestrong">You will have 5 seconds to answer each problem.</span>, and if the user selected problem level 2, we set the <code>message</code> to <span class="codestrong">You will have 10 seconds to answer each problem.</span></p>
<p class="indent">To fill the <code>join</code> block’s top and bottom inputs, drag in two empty string blocks from the Text blocks drawer, click their text areas, and enter <span class="codestrong">You will have</span> (with a space after the word <code>have</code>) in the top string block <span class="ent">➍</span> and <span class="codestrong">seconds to answer each problem</span> (with a space before the word <code>seconds</code>) in the bottom <span class="ent">➎</span>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_136"/>Then, for the <code>join</code> block’s middle input, we need to add the number of seconds the user will have to answer each problem. We’ll get that value by directing the app to select the item from the <code>seconds</code> list that holds the same index position as the user’s <code>ListPicker</code> selection in the <code>level</code> list.</p>
<p class="indent">To program this, drag in a <span class="codestrong">select list item</span> block <span class="ent">➏</span> from the List blocks drawer and snap it into the <span class="codestrong">join</span> block’s middle input. Then, identify the list from which we want the app to select the item by clicking the <strong>Variables</strong> blocks drawer and dragging the <span class="codestrong">get global seconds</span> block <span class="ent">➐</span> into the <span class="codestrong">select list item</span> block’s <span class="codestrong">list</span> socket. Finally, identify the index position of the item selected from the <code>seconds</code> list by clicking <span class="codestrong">ListPicker1</span> and dragging the <span class="codestrong">ListPicker1.SelectionIndex</span> block <span class="ent">➑</span> into the <span class="codestrong">select list item</span> block’s <span class="codestrong">index</span> socket.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev3sec92"><strong>Moving to the Practice Screen</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">Once the user selects a problem level, we’ll open <code>Screen2</code>, the practice screen, and pass the value the user selected in the <code>ListPicker</code> to that screen.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0136-01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indent">In the Blocks pane, click the <strong>Control</strong> blocks drawer, drag in the <span class="codestrong">open another screen with start value</span> block <span class="ent">➊</span>, and snap it inside the <span class="codestrong">whenListPicker1.AfterPicking</span> block under the <code>callTexttoSpeech1.Speak</code> block.</p>
<p class="indent">This <code>open another screen with start value</code> block requires us to provide a <code>screenName</code>, the name of the screen we want to open (<code>Screen2</code>), and the <code>startValue</code> to pass to <code>Screen2</code> (the problem level the user selected in <code>ListPicker1</code>). To provide these values, in the Blocks pane, click the <strong>Text</strong> blocks drawer, drag in another empty string block <span class="ent">➋</span>, and snap it into the <code>screenName</code> socket. Enter <span class="codestrong">Screen2</span> inside the empty string block to provide the name of the screen we want to open.</p>
<p class="indent">Then, to identify the start value we want to pass to <code>Screen2</code>, click <span class="codestrong">ListPicker1</span>, drag in its <span class="codestrong">ListPicker1.Selection</span> block <span class="ent">➌</span>, and snap it into the <code>startValue</code> socket.</p>
<p class="indent">Test to see how these blocks work. Once you open the app, you should hear the welcome message and see the Choose Your Level button. Once you click the button, you should see the numbers 1 and 2 as your choices. When you click the number 1, you should hear the app say you have 5 seconds to answer each problem, and when you click 2, it should say you have 10 seconds. Then the app should take you to the practice screen.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s wait to test whether the app properly transfers the start value to the practice screen until after we program the next step. Make sure everything else you’ve programmed in the app is working as described, and leave it open on your phone for more live-testing.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2sec52"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_137"/><strong>STEP 3: DISPLAYING THE PRACTICE PROBLEMS</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Just like the original “Multiplication Station” app, this app displays multiplication problems by joining one random integer (the value of global variable <code>a</code>), the multiplication operator (<code>×</code>), and another random integer (the value of global variable <code>b</code>). The app also gives users a set time interval to answer each problem. In this step, we’ll create the <code>setLevel</code> procedure that sets the values of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> and the <code>Clock</code> timer interval value in each procedure call, depending on the problem level the user selected.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll make the <code>setLevel</code> procedure require arguments for five parameters: <code>a1</code>, <code>a2</code>, <code>b1</code>, <code>b2</code>, and <code>interval</code>. Parameters <code>a1</code> and <code>a2</code> set the random integer range for global variable <code>a</code>, the first random number in each multiplication problem, and parameters <code>b1</code> and <code>b2</code> set the random integer range for global variable <code>b</code>, the second random number. The <code>interval</code> parameter holds the time interval in milliseconds. Once <code>setLevel</code> receives these arguments in a procedure call, it sets global variable <code>a</code> to a random number ranging from <code>a1</code> to <code>a2</code>, sets global variable <code>b</code> to a random number ranging from <code>b1</code> to <code>b2</code>, and sets the <code>Clock</code> timer interval to <code>interval</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">Here’s what the <code>setLevel</code> procedure looks like.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0137-01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indent">We’ll call <code>setLevel</code> inside an <code>if then</code> block to place the correct numbers in the multiplication problems and give the user the right amount of practice time based on the selected problem level.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev3sec93"><strong>Creating the setLevel Procedure</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">To make <code>setLevel</code>, click the <strong>Procedures</strong> block drawer in the <code>Screen2</code> Blocks pane, drag a <span class="codestrong">to procedure do</span> block <span class="ent">➊</span> to the Viewer, and click <span class="codestrong">procedure</span> to rename it by entering <span class="codestrong">setLevel</span>. This procedure block, like the global variables, will stand alone outside of all event handlers, allowing us to call the procedure within each event handler if we need to.</p>
<p class="indent">Next, list the required procedure parameters by clicking the blue mutator icon to the left of the words <code>to setLevel</code> and dragging five <span class="codestrong">input:x</span> blocks to the <span class="codestrong">inputs</span> block in the dialog that opens. Rename them <span class="codestrong">input:a1</span>, <span class="codestrong">input:a2</span>, <span class="codestrong">input:b1</span>, <span class="codestrong">input:b2</span>, and <span class="codestrong">input:interval</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s program the action <code>setLevel</code> will perform. We’ll start with the blocks that set global variable <code>a</code> to a random number ranging from the argument provided for <code>a1</code> to the argument provided for <code>a2</code>. Click the <strong>Variables</strong> blocks drawer and drag a <span class="codestrong">set global a</span> block <span class="ent">➋</span> into the <span class="codestrong">to setLevel</span> block next to the word <code>do</code>. Then drag a <span class="codestrong">random integer</span> block <span class="ent">➌</span> from the Math drawer and snap it to the right of the <span class="codestrong">set global a</span> block. Fill the <span class="codestrong">random integer</span> block’s first socket by mousing over the procedure’s <span class="codestrong">a1</span> parameter and dragging in a <span class="codestrong">get a1</span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_138"/>block <span class="ent">➍</span>, and fill its second socket by mousing over the <span class="codestrong">a2</span> parameter and dragging in a <span class="codestrong">get a2</span> block <span class="ent">➎</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">To set global variable <span class="codestrong">b</span> to a random number ranging from <span class="codestrong">b1</span> to <span class="codestrong">b2</span>, simply repeat the process above for global variable <span class="codestrong">b</span> by copying the blocks at <span class="ent">➋</span> through <span class="ent">➎</span>, and snapping the copy under the <span class="codestrong">set global a</span> block. Use the drop-down arrows to change <span class="codestrong">global a</span> to <span class="codestrong">global b</span>, <span class="codestrong">a1</span> to <span class="codestrong">b1</span>, and <span class="codestrong">a2</span> to <span class="codestrong">b2</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, to complete the <code>setLevel</code> procedure, we’ll set the <code>Clock</code>’s <code>TimerInterval</code> to the argument provided for <code>interval</code> in the procedure call. Click <span class="codestrong">Clock1</span> in the Blocks pane and drag its <span class="codestrong">setClock1.TimerIntervalto</span> block <span class="ent">➏</span> into the <span class="codestrong">to setLevel</span> block under the <span class="codestrong">set global b</span> block. Then mouse over the procedure’s <span class="codestrong">interval</span> parameter and snap its <span class="codestrong">get interval</span> block <span class="ent">➐</span> to the right of the <span class="codestrong">setClock1.TimerIntervalto</span> block.</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch00lev3sec94"><strong>Calling setLevel</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">We can now call <code>setLevel</code> in the <code>ClockTimer</code> event handler so that the app displays the correct problems for each level at the right time. The following code shows how we’ll call <code>setLevel</code> in a new <code>if then else</code> block within the <code>whenClock1.Timer</code> block, providing one set of arguments for the required parameters if the start value passed in from <code>Screen1</code> equals <code>1</code> and another set of arguments if it doesn’t.</p>
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0138-01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="indent">Here, we change the original “Multiplication Station” app’s <code>whenClock1.Timer</code> event handler block by replacing the global variable <code>a</code> and global variable <code>b</code> setter blocks at the top with an <code>if then else</code> block. Delete the two setters, drag an <span class="codestrong">if then</span> block <span class="ent">➊</span> to the Viewer from the Control blocks drawer, click the blue mutator icon to add an <span class="codestrong">else</span> input, and snap the <span class="codestrong">if then else</span> block inside the <span class="codestrong">whenClock1.Timer</span> block next to the word <code>do</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">Now we’ll add blocks to test whether the start value passed in from <code>Screen1</code> equals <code>1</code>, which means that the user selected problem level 1 in the <code>ListPicker</code> on <code>Screen1</code>. Drag an <span class="codestrong">=</span> comparison block <span class="ent">➋</span> from the Math drawer and snap it into the <span class="codestrong">if then else</span> block’s <span class="codestrong">if</span> socket. Fill the <span class="codestrong">=</span> comparison block’s left operand socket with a <span class="codestrong">get start value</span> block <span class="ent">➌</span> from the Control drawer and its right operand socket with a <span class="codestrong">1</span> number block <span class="ent">➍</span>.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_139"/>The next blocks tell the app how to respond to the answer to that test condition, which is whether the start value equals <code>1</code>. If the answer is yes, we want the app to set the correct problems and time interval for level 1 problems. If the answer is no, we want the app to set the correct problems and time interval for level 2 problems. In each instance, we’ll direct the action with a call to the <code>setLevel</code> procedure.</p>
<p class="indent">To add the blocks for these procedure calls, click the <strong>Procedures</strong> drawer, drag one <span class="codestrong">call setLevel</span> block <span class="ent">➎</span>, and snap it into the <span class="codestrong">if then else</span> block’s <span class="codestrong">then</span> socket. Then drag another <span class="codestrong">call setLevel</span> block <span class="ent">➏</span> and snap it into the <span class="codestrong">if then else</span> block’s <span class="codestrong">else</span> socket. Next, fill the parameter arguments for each call block with the values shown in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07tab1">Table 7-1</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Each time the <code>Clock</code> timer fires, if the start value passed from the welcome screen equals <code>1</code> (<code>then</code>, user chose problem level 1), the app calls the <code>setLevel</code> procedure to set global variable <code>a</code> to a random number ranging from 1 to 12, set global variable <code>b</code> to a random number ranging from 1 to 12, and set the <code>Clock</code> timer interval to 5 seconds.</p>
<p class="indent">If the start value passed from the welcome screen doesn’t equal <code>1</code> (<code>else</code>, user chose level 2), the app calls <code>setLevel</code> to set global variable <code>a</code> to a random number ranging from 13 to 99, set global variable <code>b</code> to a random number ranging from 10 to 99, and set the <code>Clock</code> timer interval to 10 seconds.</p>
<p class="indent">Now let’s switch to <code>Screen1</code> and test the completed app! When the welcome screen opens in your device, you should see the <code>ListPicker</code> and hear the welcome message. When you click Choose Your Level and make a selection, the app should tell you how many seconds you have to answer each problem. The practice screen should also open, and, if you chose level 1, problems should appear every 5 seconds, or, if you chose level 2, problems should appear every 10 seconds. Also, the problems should include numbers from the range expected for the selected problem level.</p>
<p class="indent">If any part of the app isn’t working as planned, debug and try again. If you placed your blocks correctly, the app should work as expected, and you’ve successfully created “Multiplication Station II”!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec50"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you built the “Multiplication Station II” app, which builds on the original “Multiplication Station” app you created in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4</a> to let users choose the difficulty level of the problems and pass that choice from one screen to the next. Instead of having to use the same code blocks over <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_140"/>and over again, you learned how to use a procedure to reuse the code that sets the problems and time limit. You also worked more with lists, <code>if then</code>, and relational operator blocks to control app flow.</p>
<p class="indent">In the next chapter, you’ll learn how to create apps that let users draw on the screen and drag images around. You’ll create the “Virtual Shades” app, where a user can take a selfie, “try on” a variety of sunglasses by dragging them into place over the picture, and draw and type on the picture with different-colored “ink.”</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec51"><strong>ON YOUR OWN</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">When you’re ready for a challenge, save new versions of your previous apps, and try these exercises. You can find solutions online at <em><a href="https://nostarch.com/programwithappinventor/">https://nostarch.com/programwithappinventor/</a></em>.</p>

    the consequential hardships you can reasonably anticipate. Now that you’ve evaluated
    the risks and considered possible lifestyle adaptations to limit your exposure
    to some of them, you’re ready to put pen to paper and start mapping out strategies
    for handling the hazards you can’t so neatly contain or evade.'

    is uncertain, so it would seem more useful to formulate a precise action plan
    in the moment, once you know exactly what you’re dealing with. This, indeed, would
    keep things simple—but as highlighted in Chapter 10, you should never underestimate
    the difficulty of making good decisions hurriedly and under intense stress. A
    checklist written ahead of time is essentially a letter to your anxious and tired
    future self, helping you collect your thoughts and make sure you don’t miss anything.
    Checklists are the lifeblood of many critical professions; they feature prominently
    in aviation and in medicine, and they’re common in my own field when responding
    to data breaches and other computer incidents. If they’re useful for pilots and
    brain surgeons, they’ll be useful for you too.

    is that writing helps you find out what you think. The concepts in your head can
    be nebulous and ever shifting, and the mental shortcuts you take may not be obvious
    until it’s too late. Organizing your thoughts on paper captures a better-defined
    snapshot that can be refined over time and pressure-tested for flaws.

    you might be undecided about some of the disasters outlined in Chapters 2 through
    4 or still mulling over the financial choices of Chapters 6 and 7. You may also
    have doubts about supplies, such as whether you should be buying bottled water
    or self-defense gear. All of this is fine; capture the open questions and make
    the playbook a living document. Some of these topics will be addressed later in
    the book. Others may warrant independent research down the line.

    captured in Chapter 2 are probably a good starting point, along with any considerations
    unique to your family situation, occupation, and so forth. Some of the regional
    calamities outlined in Chapter 3 may be worth incorporating, but this should be
    done with care; for example, residents of Florida probably don’t have to worry
    too much about volcanic activity in the state. As for the existential cataclysms
    of Chapter 4, most can probably be left out of the document, unless any of them
    strikes a particular chord.

    for each of the crises outlined in the document, imagining how the situation could
    unfold, how long it might last, and what impacts it could have. The narrative
    you develop doesn’t need to be perfect. Writing something that seems plausible
    based on what you know today suffices, taking note of any matters you want to
    study further at a later date.

    recession that progresses to a global financial collapse, a local territorial
    dispute that ends in nuclear war. A simple way to counter this bias is to split
    each scenario into three separate stories that can merrily coexist in the document.
    The first one should deal with the most optimistic prediction, a mild variant
    of the crisis where the impacts are modest and the duration of any hardships is
    reasonably short. A middle-of-the road narrative should follow, marked by significant
    hardships that align with reasonably recent historical precedent. The final story
    is the severe variant, a believable but pessimistic prophecy in which the situation
    spirals out of control and almost all bets are off.'

    estimate of the probability that it might come true. Both the optimistic and the
    pessimistic variants probably hinge on multiple events unfolding in a particularly
    fortuitous or a particularly disastrous way. In light of this, the middle-of-the-road
    variant might very well be the best way to model the consequences of a particular
    calamity.

    of the action plan for each scenario in the document. I recommend structuring
    the plans as simple numbered lists, each divided into two parts. The first part
    should deal with helpful measures you can take care of ahead of time, such as
    getting your finances in order or stockpiling gear. The second part should focus
    on the steps you must follow as the disaster unfolds, such as loading specific
    items into the car and evacuating from a wildfire to stay with a friend or relative.
    “Before the disaster” and “during the disaster” work as simple monikers to organize
    the list.

    without a list of the belongings you want to save from a wildfire, there’s no
    way of knowing whether the items would even fit into a car. Similarly, if your
    plan doesn’t pick a specific destination to evacuate to, you may end up sleeping
    in the car or staying at a noisy and crowded shelter for weeks.

    firsthand account of a slow-simmering crisis, it’s the parable of the boiling
    frog: when every hour, every day, or every week is only a tiny bit worse than
    the one before it, humans find it extremely difficult to draw the line and take
    decisive action before it’s too late. The desire to “wait and see” is how people
    perish in wildfires, end up on on the roofs of submerged homes, or fall prey to
    murderous regimes that, after years of dehumanizing their enemies, finally progress
    to genocide.'

    indicators* that would signal when things are no longer normal and you need to
    switch gears. For a pandemic, the indicator could be a particular number of cases
    diagnosed in your town; for impending genocide, it could be the exclusion of certain
    groups from political or economic life. The point of these criteria isn’t that
    they need to be perfect and immutable. It’s that revising them is a deliberate
    and conscious step, taking the place of a gradual cognitive drift.

    in essence, an estimate of how long you can wait and still escape serious harm.

    wildfire, you will need a certain minimum distance to the fire front to still

    hard to avoid. The plans you hatch can be derailed in countless ways, from flawed
    intelligence to malfunctioning equipment, unexpected guests, or incidental injury.
    To avoid unpleasant surprises, it’s important to stress-test your assumptions
    by asking what could go wrong every step along the way. For example, what if you’re
    someplace other than home? What if some of your supplies are misplaced or spoiled?
    Or, what if it’s unsafe to travel in the direction you wanted to go?

    what would happen if you were caught away from home is certainly worthwhile, but
    that doesn’t mean it makes sense to haul 50 pounds of survival gear on your short,
    once-in-a-blue-moon vacation getaway. The probability that something disastrous
    will happen that particular week is infinitesimally low.

    the wisdom of keeping a bag of supplies locked in the bedroom closet should be
    called into question; putting some items in the trunk of the car may be a better
    bet. Unnecessary complexity in your plans should be called out too. For example,
    for short-term emergencies, ready-to-eat foods are far better than an elaborate
    off-the-grid cooking plan.

    and witnessed by two other people or formally notarized. The document essentially
    prescribes a set of steps to follow in a variety of scenarios, depending on who
    survives you or on any other factors you want to take into account. The will should
    also name an *executor*: a person who would tend to the estate, settle any enforceable
    debts, and faithfully carry out the instructions in the document. Naming a backup
    executor in case the primary one is unable or unwilling to serve is a good plan;
    otherwise, the court may appoint a stranger who’s going to collect a hefty fee
    or make the process more burdensome than it needs to be.'

    transfer speedier or to keep family finances out of public view. As noted in Chapter
    2, the simplest method is to set up any new accounts as *joint tenancy* or *community
    property*. This way, if you die, the other owner on the record lawfully retains
    full control of the funds. Another nearly seamless approach is to leave *transfer-on-death*
    directives with your financial institution, usually requiring nothing more than
    a simple online form. More complex strategies may involve setting up a closely
    held LLC or a living trust with a prescribed method of divvying up the assets
    if a member dies. The tax consequences for each of these arrangements differ;
    some research should be done to avoid saddling others with unnecessary bills.

    This can be particularly tricky if some of the property is distributed across

    boxes, and so forth. The will should provide hints, and must itself be discoverable
    too: most lawyers would advise against preparing multiple copies to avoid potential
    confusion, but from the point of view of disaster planning, it can be a good move.
    One copy can be stored with your own vital documents, while the other can be deposited
    with a close family member or a trusted friend.'

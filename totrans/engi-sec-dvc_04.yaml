    and seats, and probably at least one window. If you set your sights on engineering
    a secure device, you also want to have some essential building blocks.

- en: Modern security would not be possible without a reliable source of random numbers
    and cryptographic operations that are optimized for the processors of your choice.
    Further, since many crypto algorithms rely on secrets, a decent storage option
    for this confidential data is required. Last but not least, unique and secure
    device identities in combination with secure communication channels are mandatory
    for every connected device. Since the devil is in the details for all these topics,
    this second part of the book dedicates one chapter to each of them.

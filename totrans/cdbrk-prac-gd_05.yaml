- en: The world’s most famous unsolved cryptogram, the Voynich manuscript, is a 230-page
    document in the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Yale University in
    Connecticut. From cover to cover, this probably 600-year-old, handwritten book
    is filled with incomprehensible text. The writing looks like a simple substitution
    cipher with spaces of the different-alphabet type, and the plaintext appears to
    have been written in an unknown language (but could also be an ordinary text written
    in a lost writing system, or completely meaningless nonsense). We will revisit
    the Voynich manuscript at the end of this chapter.

    by Richard SantaColoma), which was sent in 1912.^([1](b06.xhtml#c05-endnote-1))
    Because at least 90% of the encrypted postcards we have seen are encrypted with
    a simple substitution cipher, we can assume that we are dealing with one here.
    In addition, the sender used a nonstandard alphabet, which is also typical for
    a simple substitution cipher.

    things are not always that simple. In fact, detecting a cryptogram’s plaintext
    language may be a major challenge, which is why it is always a good idea to learn

    of *EIN*) contain letter repetitions. (*EINEN* even contains two.) In fact, the
    word `BCDBD` in the third-to-last line of the transcript is easily identified

    like a good candidate. At first glance, CrypTool 2 delivers disappointing results,
    as it gives us twenty-six different matches for this pattern ([Figure 5-3](#figure5-3)).
    Even if we discard words such as `PIPELINES`, `MACULATURE`, and `GOLDBONDS`, which
    are not very likely to appear on a 1906 postcard, we are left with many choices.

    note also included spaces and punctuation marks between the words, which always
    makes guessing the words considerably easier. As you can see, symbols 1–42 are
    enclosed between quotation marks, and there is a colon after symbol 20\. The most
    frequently occurring character is symbol 7, which is repeated nine times.

- en: Langie first tried to determine the plaintext language. Because the story about
    the man and his son took place in the French-speaking part of Switzerland, French
    was the most likely option. However, the word starting at symbol 43 begins with
    a double letter, which hardly ever happens in a French text. Langie then assumed
    that the plaintext might be written in Spanish, a language spoken by the client’s
    son. The only double letter encountered at the beginning of Spanish words is *L*
    (for instance, in *llevar* or *llamarse*).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If this assumption were correct, symbol 45, the most frequent one in the cryptogram,
    is likely to be an `A` or an `E` (in Spanish, a double *L* is always followed
    by a vowel, and *A* and *E* are frequent letters). The two letters `L` and `A`/`E`
    occur again at the end of the last word of the text, but in reverse order. This
    is a five-letter word whose first letter is the same as the third, so it must
    be `PAPEL` (`paper`).

- en: One of the most famous unsolved cryptograms in the world, the centuries-old
    Voynich manuscript is a handwritten collection of unknown text and cryptic illustrations.
    The manuscript is named after book dealer Wilfrid Voynich (1865–1930), who reportedly
    purchased it in 1912 from an Italian Jesuit college. Today, the manuscript is
    owned by the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Yale University in Connecticut,
    where it is known as Beinecke MS 408.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The manuscript uses an alphabet that consists of approximately twenty-five symbols.
    Through radiocarbon analysis, the vellum (calfskin) it is written upon was dated
    to the early fifteenth century. Hundreds of experts and generations of hobbyist
    researchers have examined the manuscript in great detail, but their main questions
    remain unanswered. We do not know where, when, and by whom it was written, despite
    the radiocarbon dating. The purpose of the manuscript is also unclear. Theories
    have proposed that it is an herbal or religious text, an alchemical tome, or a
    sales catalog for medicinal ointments. Forgery and fraud have been suggested,
    as well. The plants depicted cannot be identified with certainty, and most look
    like mere fantasy images, containing no clear relationship to any specific place,
    time, religion, or ideology.

    manuscript have been published, but none have been accepted by experts. Naturally,
    researchers have applied to the text all codebreaking methods described in our
    book, including frequency analysis, word guessing, and the index of coincidence,
    to no avail. It is also unclear in which language the plaintext was written (if
    in any at all). People have argued in favor of Italian, Latin, Greek, English,
    German, and many others.

    origin. His ancestry mainly stems from ancient Thuringia (Thüringen), now a region
    in central Germany, and his family has always spoken German. A symbol on the front

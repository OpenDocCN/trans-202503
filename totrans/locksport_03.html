<div class="image1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/02fig00.jpg"/></div>
<p class="noindent">Before we dive into picking, it’s worth taking some time to examine the locks themselves. Locks come in a huge variety of designs based on factors including what the lock will be used on, how it’s attached, how secure it needs to be, and even the country where it will be used. These criteria matter greatly to someone installing a lock but are largely irrelevant to locksporters. Since we’re concerned only with opening a lock, locksporters usually set aside any accessories, such as the hardware to mount it to a door. In fact, locksporters typically save only the lock’s cylinder, the part normally operated with a key. The exception is locks with a cylinder that can’t be removed from the rest of the lock hardware, such as some padlocks.</p>
<p class="indent">But while the shape of the lock or cylinder isn’t as important to locksporters as the lock mechanics, it can still play a part in the way a lock is picked. Being familiar with the various types of locks and cylinders, as <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_16"/>well as the lockpicking tools you might need for them, is also helpful when you’re buying, trading, researching, or discussing locks.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev5">Padlocks</h3>
<p class="noindent">The most recognizable and ubiquitous lock is the <em>padlock</em>. Of all the lock types, padlocks are the most diverse. They include everything from suitcase zipper locks the size of a thumbnail to behemoths like the Sargent &amp; Greenleaf (S&amp;G) 951, which weighs several pounds and can withstand a barrage of bullets—an important trait for a lock used to secure military depots. <a href="ch2.xhtml#ch2fig1">Figure 2-1</a> shows an assortment of padlocks.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch2fig1" src="../images/02fig01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap1"><em>Figure 2-1: Left to right: a Lockwood luggage lock, a Master Lock #1, and an S&amp;G 951</em></p>
<p class="indent">Padlocks are a great place to start picking, as they’re readily available in hardware stores, big-box stores, and even supermarkets and convenience stores. Most are reasonably sized, making them easy to hold while picking. Because they vary significantly in both their locking mechanisms and security features, you can find padlocks to challenge lockpickers of any skill level. And, best of all, padlocks often make a very satisfying <em>clang</em> when you get them open.</p>
<p class="indent">There are a few things to know about picking padlocks. In most cases, you can open them only by turning their <em>plug</em> (the part that rotates) clockwise, whether you’re picking or using the key. Also, once you’ve picked a padlock, the force required to turn and open it varies considerably depending on the lock’s brand and model. Whenever possible, test a padlock with a key first to get a feel for the amount of force you’ll need. Finally, since padlocks vary so much in size and weight, it’s a good idea to have a vise on hand to hold the lock while you’re picking it.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev6"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_17"/>Cylinder Locks</h3>
<p class="noindent">If you’ve locked or unlocked any door, the odds are good that you’ve used a <em>cylinder lock</em>. Lock cylinders come in a variety of shapes and sizes to accommodate multiple styles of doors and door hardware (such as doorknobs) that are used in different countries. In this section, we’ll look at some of the most common types of door cylinders: Euro profile, key-in-knob, interchangeable core, rim, and mortise cylinders.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec14"><em>Euro Profile Cylinders</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">While not common in the US, <em>European profile cylinders</em>—usually shortened to <em>Euro profile</em>, <em>Euro cylinders</em>, or even just <em>profile cylinders</em>—are, as their name indicates, found throughout much of Europe, most often in doors. Euro profile cylinders vary considerably in both length and locking mechanism but can be recognized by their signature shape, which looks somewhat like an upside-down exclamation point, as shown in <a href="ch2.xhtml#ch2fig2">Figure 2-2</a>.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch2fig2" src="../images/02fig02.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap1"><em>Figure 2-2: Euro profile cylinders mounted in a door (left) and unmounted (right)</em></p>
<p class="indent">Many Euro profile cylinders are double-sided, meaning they have a <em>keyway</em> (the hole to insert the key) on both sides of the lock. However, some have a <em>thumb turn</em> (a small knob to lock or unlock the lock without a key) on the interior side and a keyway only on the exterior side. In picking competitions that include Euro profile cylinders, double-sided locks are the norm, and typically the contestant can pick either side. When not mounted in a door, many cylinder types, including Euro profile cylinders, can be picked clockwise or counterclockwise.</p>
<p class="indent">Double-sided locks are less common in the US, where fire safety often takes precedence over door security. Single-sided locks with a thumb turn can be quickly opened from the inside, but they make it easier for thieves to break a nearby window and reach in to unlock the door.</p>
<p class="indent">The Euro profile cylinder’s shape fits well in most people’s palms, so many locksporters prefer to hold it rather than use a vise when picking. For <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_18"/>extended picking sessions, such as long competitions, however, using a vise can help prevent hand cramps.</p>
<p class="block1">I designed a holder to make it easy to secure Euro profile cylinders with a vise or clamp; you can download the 3D model at <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3610868"><em>https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3610868</em></a>. I use a plastic, 3D-printed version of this holder in picking and impressioning competitions.</p>

<p class="indent">The Euro profile cylinder has a few variations. The <em>Swiss cylinder</em> format looks similar to a Euro profile cylinder, except that the bottom area where the lock screws into the door is centered in the cylinder rather than extending its full width, as shown in <a href="ch2.xhtml#ch2fig3">Figure 2-3</a>.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch2fig3" src="../images/02fig03.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap1"><em>Figure 2-3: A Swiss cylinder lock</em></p>
<p class="indent">Several <em>oval-shaped cylinders</em> exist, including UK, Australian, and Norwegian variants. Each is similar to a single- or double-sided Euro profile cylinder, but the top and bottom of the lock are the same width. <a href="ch2.xhtml#ch2fig4">Figure 2-4</a> shows a single-sided Australian oval cylinder.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch2fig4" src="../images/02fig04.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap1"><em>Figure 2-4: An oval-format BiLock cylinder</em></p>
<p class="indent">The main difference between the oval variants is in the way they’re screwed into a door, which is inconsequential to locksporters.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec15"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_19"/><em>Key-in-Knob Cylinders</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">In the US, <em>key-in-knob (KIK) cylinders</em>, also known as <em>key-in-lever cylinders</em>, are extremely popular. These small locks fit inside a doorknob or lever handle, hence their name. Like Euro profile cylinders, unmounted KIKs can be picked clockwise or counterclockwise.</p>
<p class="indent">Typically, KIK cylinders look like a Euro profile cylinder that’s been snapped in half and slightly shrunk. Their shape is a bit less recognizable, though, because everything except the plug is hidden inside the knob. For example, only the silver portion of the KIK cylinder shown in <a href="ch2.xhtml#ch2fig5">Figure 2-5</a> would be visible when the lock is installed.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch2fig5" src="../images/02fig05.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap1"><em>Figure 2-5: An unmounted KIK cylinder</em></p>
<p class="indent">Higher-end padlocks that can be disassembled and rekeyed also often contain a cylinder that looks like a slightly shrunken KIK. Examples include many American-brand locks and their clones.</p>
<p class="indent">KIK cylinders can be hard to hold while picking because of their small size and sharp edges, so some pickers prefer to mount them in a vise. Others go so far as to 3D print a plastic shell to make them easier to hold. If you have access to a 3D printer, searching <em>KIK holder</em> on your favorite 3D-model-sharing repository should turn up several options.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec16"><em>Interchangeable Core Cylinders</em></h4>
<p class="noindent">An <em>interchangeable core (IC) cylinder</em> looks like a figure eight or a snowman with a metal bar protruding from the side, known as a <em>control lug</em>. ICs are common in office and commercial buildings because they can easily be removed and replaced using nothing more than a <em>control key</em>, a special key that retracts the control lug into the core. When someone loses a key or leaves the company, rekeying the office takes 5 seconds instead of 30 minutes because a new core can simply be swapped in using the control key. The old cores are typically rekeyed and set aside for the next time they’re needed.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>Many people, even locksmiths, use the terms</em> cylinder <em>and</em> core—<em>and sometimes even</em> lock<em>—synonymously. We’ll explain the subtle differences between these terms in the next chapter, but don’t be surprised if you hear them used interchangeably</em>.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_20"/>ICs are made in multiple sizes and configurations, such as <em>small-format interchangeable core (SFIC)</em>, <em>large-format interchangeable core (LFIC)</em>, and <em>removable core (RC)</em>. While SFIC is an industry-standard term used to describe a very specific size and shape originally designed and created by the BEST Lock Corporation (now part of Dormakaba), LFICs come in many shapes and sizes. SFICs are made up of two symmetrical circles and are smaller than LFICs and RCs. LFICs and RCs are less standardized and vary depending on the brand, but they often have a core comprising two circles of slightly different sizes. <a href="ch2.xhtml#ch2fig6">Figure 2-6</a> shows an LFIC (left) and an SFIC (right).</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch2fig6" src="../images/02fig06.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap1"><em>Figure 2-6: Corbin Russwin LFIC (left) and BEST SFIC (right)</em></p>
<p class="indent">Picking ICs can be tricky, because the same mechanism that enables the control key to easily remove the lock can also interfere with picking. We suggest holding off on picking ICs until you’ve successfully picked some more basic locks.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec17"><em>Rim and Mortise Cylinders</em></h4>
<p class="noindent"><em>Rim cylinders</em> are frequently used in deadbolts, and <em>mortise cylinders</em> are often found on commercial doors. While they vary in size, the most common ones are about 3.5 cm or 1.25 inches in length and width. The two types look similar from the front, but they differ in the way they’re installed in a door, as you can see from the side views shown in <a href="ch2.xhtml#ch2fig7">Figure 2-7</a>.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch2fig7" src="../images/02fig07.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap1"><em>Figure: 2-7: A mortise cylinder (left) and a rim cylinder (right)</em></p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_21"/>Rim cylinders are smooth but have two threaded holes in the back to screw the lock to the surface of the door. Mortise cylinders, on the other hand, have a threaded housing that allows the entire cylinder to be threaded into the lock hardware, which is then inserted into a cutout in the door, known as a <em>mortise</em>. Once the mortise cylinder is threaded into the lock, one or more set screws are used to hold the cylinder in place so it can’t be backed out.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev7">Mortise Locksets</h3>
<p class="noindent">Finally, the <em>mortise lockset</em> is a mortise lock with a cylinder that is integrated into the mortise hardware and is not removable; that is, the security locking features are incorporated into the mortise lock body itself. It’s most commonly found in England and in antique doors elsewhere. As <a href="ch2.xhtml#ch2fig8">Figure 2-8</a> shows, these locks are large, rectangular boxes that fit into a mortise in the edge of a door.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="ch2fig8" src="../images/02fig08.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap1"><em>Figure 2-8: A mortise lockset installed in a door</em></p>
<p class="indent">Mortise locksets are frequently associated with lever lock and warded lock mechanisms, which we’ll discuss in the next chapter. While not terribly common in lockpicking circles, lever locks in mortise lockset form have been a part of the Dutch Open competition for the past several years. We’ll cover these locks extensively in <a href="part5.xhtml">Part V</a>.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev8">Summary</h3>
<p class="noindent">This chapter examined a variety of common lock and cylinder types and discussed their distinguishing characteristics. We also touched on terms for parts of a lock like <em>keyway</em>, <em>plug</em>, and <em>core</em>. In the next chapter, we’ll take a deeper dive into those and other lock internals as we cover common lock mechanisms.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_22"/></p>

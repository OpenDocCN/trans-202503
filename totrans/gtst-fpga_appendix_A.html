<p class="COS">This appendix lists a few example FPGA development boards that you can use to work on the projects in this book. A dev board that you can program is a valuable learning tool. There’s nothing more satisfying than blinking LEDs, pushing buttons, and interfacing to external devices! You can certainly learn a lot from this book without completing the practical examples. But to really unlock its value I recommend purchasing a board, such as one of the devices mentioned here, and working through all of the projects using physical hardware.</p>
<p class="TX">In <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter2.xhtml">Chapter 2</a></span> we discussed some criteria for selecting a board, including the features required to complete the book’s projects as written. In <span aria-label=" Page 256. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_256" role="doc-pagebreak"/>particular, I recommend choosing a board with a Lattice iCE40 FPGA, a USB connection, and peripherals such as LEDs, push buttons, and a seven-segment display. The boards covered here either meet these requirements off-the-shelf or allow you to meet them by connecting a few extra peripherals. There are other boards that will work, too; you can use any of these or use these recommendations as a starting point for your own research.</p>

<h2 class="H1" id="sec1"><span id="h-154"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">The Nandland Go Board</samp></h2>
<p class="TNI1">I created the Nandland Go Board (<a href="#figA-1">Figure A-1</a>) as a part of a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2016 to fill a gap in the market: a lack of FPGA development boards that were fun, affordable, and easy to use for beginners. I designed the board with many peripherals, to allow for a wide range of interesting projects. The Go Board has everything you need to work on all of the projects in this book without any modifications.</p>

</figure>
<p class="TX">The FPGA on the Go Board is an iCE40 HX1K, which is small compared to modern AMD and Intel FPGAs but powerful enough to create the game <i>Pong</i> on a VGA monitor. The board has four LEDs, four push-button switches, two seven-segment displays, a Pmod connector, a VGA connector, and a USB connector for power, programming, and communication. At about $65 at the time of writing, it’s an affordable board that will allow you to try many different projects in either Verilog or VHDL. It’s available through <a href="https://nandland.com"><i>https://<wbr/>nandland<wbr/>.com</i></a>.</p>

<h2 class="H1" id="sec2"><span id="h-155"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">The Lattice iCEstick</samp></h2>
<p class="TNI1">Lattice designed the iCEstick FPGA development board to be plugged directly into the USB port of a computer, like a thumb drive. It has the same FPGA as the Go Board (an iCE40 HX1K), but it’s a bit more limited in terms of built-in peripherals. There are five LEDs available, a Pmod connector, and an IrDA transceiver for sending and receiving infrared data.</p>
<p class="TX"><span aria-label=" Page 257. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_257" role="doc-pagebreak"/>At the time of writing the iCEstick is priced at around $50, and it can be purchased directly from Lattice’s website (<a href="https://latticesemi.com"><i>https://<wbr/>latticesemi<wbr/>.com</i></a>) or through electronics distributers such as Digi-Key (<a href="https://digikey.com"><i>https://<wbr/>digikey<wbr/>.com</i></a>). To use this development board for the projects in this book, you’ll need to make use of the Pmod connector to expand its capabilities. At a minimum, I would recommend purchasing a breakout board with additional button inputs; for example, Digilent (<a href="https://digilent.com"><i>https://<wbr/>digilent<wbr/>.com</i></a>) sells a Pmod module with four push-button switches.</p>
<p class="TX">The iCEstick doesn’t have enough Pmod connectors to interface to a seven-segment display and a button module at the same time for the state machine project in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter8.xhtml">Chapter 8</a></span>. However, if you want to implement the seven-segment display portion of the project, you can connect an individual display using some of the 16 through-hole I/O connections on the sides of the board.</p>

<h2 class="H1" id="sec3"><span id="h-156"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">The Alchitry Cu</samp></h2>
<p class="TNI1">The Alchitry Cu is similar to the iCEstick in that it’s a relatively simple board with a single FPGA and connectors, and not many on-board peripherals. The difference is that the Alchitry Cu has many more connectors available, so you can interface to more peripherals. Additionally, it uses a larger FPGA, the iCE40 HX8K, which has more resources available for larger, more complicated projects.</p>
<p class="TX">The Alchitry Cu can be paired with the Alchitry Io Element Board to expand its capabilities: the Io mounts directly on top of the Cu, similar to an Arduino shield, and adds 4 seven-segment displays, 5 push buttons, 24 LEDs, and 24 switches. This option is the most expensive of the three discussed here; the Cu and Io together cost around $85 as of this writing. You can purchase the boards at <a href="https://sparkfun.com"><i>https://<wbr/>sparkfun<wbr/>.com</i></a>.</p>

<h2 class="H1" id="sec4"><span id="h-157"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Switching Between Boards</samp></h2>
<p class="TNI1">As I mentioned in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter2.xhtml">Chapter 2</a></span>, the beauty of Verilog and VHDL is that they’re FPGA-agnostic. The code that you write for one development board will translate very well to another board, often with no modifications needed, provided you aren’t using device-specific hard IP features like the ones discussed in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter9.xhtml">Chapter 9</a></span>. This makes it quite natural to start your FPGA journey on a low-cost, easy-to-use iCE40-based board like the ones described here, and then level up to a fancier development board as you gain experience. You’ll be able to take all the projects you developed for your first board and port them to a new, more advanced board with minimal revision.</p>

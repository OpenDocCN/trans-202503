<p class="noindent">If you found that your computer was already set up without you having to go through the steps in “<a href="ch00.xhtml#toc_lev17">Setting Up Your Computer</a>” on <a href="ch00.xhtml#page_17">page 17</a>, it’s possible that you have a <em>local account</em> rather than a Microsoft account. This can happen if you upgraded from an older operating system, like Windows 7, or if the shop selling you the computer set it up in advance. A local account lets you log into your computer and use it in the same way, but it doesn’t give you access to any of Microsoft’s online services such as the Store, OneDrive, Skype, and the Mail app, which you’ll need for this book. Here’s how to check if you have a Microsoft account and, if you don’t, how to create one.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_298"/><a id="toc_lev266"/>Do I Have a Microsoft Account?</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">To check whether you have a Microsoft account or a local account, follow these steps:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">Click the <strong>start button</strong> in the bottom-left corner of the screen.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">Click the <strong>settingsbutton</strong>, highlighted here.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0298-01.jpg"/></div></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">This should bring up the Settings screen. Click the <strong>Accounts</strong> option.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">You should see a line of text underneath your name. If this line shows your email address, it means you have a Microsoft account and there’s no need to proceed to set one up. If this line says “Local Account,” you don’t have a Microsoft account, so continue to the next section to create a Microsoft account.</p></li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0298-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3"><a id="toc_lev267"/>Creating a Microsoft Account</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">If you have a local account, you’ll need to switch to a Microsoft account to use all of the features available in Windows 10.</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_299"/>Click the <strong>Sign in with a Microsoft account instead</strong> link.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0299-01.jpg"/></div></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">Follow the steps onscreen to create a Microsoft account. The process is very similar to “<a href="ch00.xhtml#toc_lev21">Creating a Microsoft Account</a>” on <a href="ch00.xhtml#page_20">page 20</a>, so flip back for more information if you need help.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">You will now be taken back to the Accounts screen in the Settings window, where you should be able to see your new Microsoft account.</p></li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0299-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Now that you’ve created a Microsoft account, you’re ready to work through all the chapters in the book in order to explore Windows 10.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_300"/></p>&#13;

    wish I had when I was learning JavaScript. Readers can learn from the very basics
    all the way through making real games and applications that are relevant to ‘real-world’
    development practices.”

- en: “*JavaScript Crash Course* offers practical, pragmatic, and project-based education
    on how to think about and work with JavaScript. Nick Morgan has the experience
    to introduce you to the language with examples that build on each other, and he
    quickly dives into creating real projects. As you delve deeper into the book,
    you’ll realize that your building blocks are the internet itself. You’ll find
    yourself using audio and sound generation techniques, painting with the Canvas
    API, and pulling in third-party JavaScript libraries. By the time you complete
    the crash course, you’ll be ready to start your own projects. Nick is providing
    a wonderful service with his hands-on teaching, both here and in *JavaScript for
    Kids*. I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did.”

    approachable descriptions that are easily accessible to beginners. Throw in some
    fun lessons in graphics and sound to create a game, and you’ve got an excellent
    and engaging JavaScript book that’s well worth your time.”

			<p class="ChapterIntro"><a id="251"/> Inkscape has three main extensibility mechanisms: filters, path effects, and extensions. If you're a developer eager to add a cool new feature that doesn't need to be in the core of the vector editor, you should look into one of these. Filters (<a href="c17.xhtml#ch17">Chapter 17</a>), rooted in bitmap processing software, are mostly for altering colors and textures; in this chapter, continuing the topic of shapes and paths, I  describe the interactive path effects that add a whole new level of complexity—and excitement—to plain SVG paths. Extensions, which are the most universal (but least interactive) way to provide new functionality for Inkscape users, are covered  in <a href="c19.xhtml#ch19">Chapter 19</a>, although we'll look at path-processing extensions in <a href="#section13.4">13.4</a>.</p>
			<a id="section13.1"/>
			<h2>13.1 How Path Effects Work</h2>
			<p><em>Live path effects</em> (LPEs), or simply <em>path effects</em>, 
are an easy-to-use (for the end user) yet powerful (for the developer) mechanism for 
modifying the visible shape of a path—for example, rounding the corners, roughening a smooth path,
or distorting it by blowing or pinching.
When you apply a path effect (or multiple path effects) to a path, the <em>original</em> before-the-effect path is still
there—you can <a id="252"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_252" title="252"/>always view and edit it. Every time you edit the original path, the <em>visible</em> after-the-effect
path is recalculated from that original path and the effect parameters. That's what the <em>live</em> in "live path effects" means!</p>
			<p>Inkscape's path effects are another application of the basic principle of vector
graphics: instead of making some permanent and destructive change, leave the original
object unchanged and record the way the change is to be applied to it. After that,
both the original object and the parameters of the effect can be edited separately at any time.</p>
			<p>
				Despite the name, path effects apply not only to paths but also to shapes (<a href="c11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11</a>)—which remain shapes and are still editable as such, using the handles or
numeric parameters in their shape tools (<a href="#fig13-1">Figure 13-1</a>). A path effect can also be applied to a group, which gives the
same result as if the effect were applied to all the paths and shapes in the group.
Path effects never apply to text objects, clones, or bitmaps.</p>

				<img alt="" src="14/pe-example.svg.png"/>

						Figure 13-1: The <span class="ui">Sketch</span> effect (<a href="#section13.3.4.1">13.3.4.1</a>) applied to a path (left) and to a 3D box (right)</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				When a path effect is applied to an object, the only aspect that changes is the<em>visible shape</em> of the object; if you want to change its <em>style</em> in a
nondestructive way, try filters instead (<a href="c17.xhtml#ch17">Chapter 17</a>). Path effects can be stacked
on top of one another, so that the output of one effect is the input for the next one.</p>
			<p>
				Path effects are an Inkscape-only feature; unlike, for example, filters, path effects are not part of the SVG standard.
However, they are implemented in an SVG-compatible way. In other words, if you load an SVG file that uses a path effect
into any SVG viewer (or into an old version of Inkscape that did not support this effect), you will see the same<em>visible</em> path that you see in latest Inkscape—just without access to the <em>original</em>
path and the effect parameters.</p>

					<h2>Path Effects in SVG</h2>
					<p>
						In a <code>path</code> element with a path effect applied, the original path data is
stored in the <code>inkscape:original-d</code> attribute. The effect is given by
the <code>inkscape:path-effect</code> attribute that refers to a specific <code>inkscape:path-effect</code> element
in the <code>defs</code> of the document (<a href="b01.xhtml#sectionA.4">A.4</a>).
The automatically calculated result of the effect is stored in the
standard <code>d</code> attribute of the path object. All Inkscape tools and commands
know that in a path with a path effect applied, they should ignore the <code>d</code> but work on
the <code>inkscape:original-d</code> instead.</p>

				</section>
			</aside>
			<p><a id="253"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_253" title="253"/>Unfortunately, <em>display</em> compatibility (your files are guaranteed to look the same in all SVG viewers) does not imply <em>editing</em> compatibility. If you edit an SVG document with path effects in another editor or in an old Inkscape version, you are editing the <em>visible</em> path, ignoring the effect. If you then reload the edited file
into a version of Inkscape that does support the effect and try to edit it there, your changes will be lost because the
new visible path will be regenerated from the unchanged original path and the effect parameters. What's worse,
the list of path effects and their interpretations is not standardized; there is no guarantee that
future versions of Inkscape will implement all the effects you're using in exactly the same way.</p>
			<p>
				Despite these potential drawbacks, path effects remain a crucial Inkscape technology that, since its inception,
has proliferated all across the application. Under the hood, many commands and features are
implemented as path effects. Examples include pressure-sensitive (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.1.2.2">14.1.2.2</a>) and shaped (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.1.5">14.1.5</a>) strokes in the
Pen and Pencil tools, the Spiro and BSpline modes in those tools (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.1.4">14.1.4</a>), as well as Power Clip and Power Mask (<a href="#section13.3.12">13.3.12</a>).</p>
			<a id="section13.2"/><h2>13.2 Managing Path Effects</h2>
			<p>
				Inkscape comes with a number of sample SVG files (in the inkscape/examples folder under the 
Inkscape data folder that you can look up in <span class="ui">Preferences</span>, <span class="ui">System</span> page).
A few of these sample files (with names starting with live-path-effects) demonstrate and explain
some Inkscape path effects.  Let's load and explore one of them to get a quick idea of how a path effect may look and behave.</p>
			<p>
				You will notice that a path object that has one or more path effects applied says so in the status bar when you select it—for example,<span class="ui">Path 328 nodes, path effect: Pattern Along Path, Roughen in layer Background</span>. 
You can use a copy/paste trick to reuse the same effect (or stack of effects) on any number of paths: copy the
source object (Ctrl-C), select other path (or shape) object(s), and use the <span class="ui"><strong>Path<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Paste Path
Effect</strong></span> command (Ctrl-7).</p>
			<p>
				To clear away the path effect and return to the original path, use the <span class="ui"><strong>Remove Path Effect</strong></span> command in the <span class="ui"><strong>Path</strong></span> menu. If,
however, you want to preserve the result of the effect and forget the original path (this is sometimes
called "flattening" or "baking in" the effect), use the <span class="ui"><strong>Object to Path</strong></span>
command (Shift-Ctrl-C); after it, your path will look exactly the same but the effect will be gone.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>
						The <span class="ui">Object to Path</span> command 
is a way to ensure that your file is not only correctly rendered but also editable in older
versions of Inkscape and in SVG editors other than Inkscape.</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>
				Boolean operations (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.2">12.2</a>) on paths with path effects "flatten" them as well—that is, the result is
the same as if you used <span class="ui">Object to Path</span> on all paths beforehand (however, there is a path effect reimplementation
of Boolean operations that is nondestructive, <a href="#section13.3.10">13.3.10</a>).
Unfortunately, this is also the case for the <span class="ui">Combine</span> and <span class="ui">Break Apart</span> operations (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.1.1">12.1.1</a>), even though
many effects work on subpaths, so a way to manipulate subpaths without losing the effect would be very useful.
(In fact, that's how <span class="ui">Combine</span> and <span class="ui">Break Apart</span> used to work in previous versions of Inkscape.) A workaround is to group
separate paths together and apply the <a id="254"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_254" title="254"/>effects to the group. After that, you can enter the group (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.9.1">4.9.1</a>) and
combine or break apart the paths inside as needed, without losing the effect on the group.</p>
			<p>
				The Node tool (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.5">12.5</a>) edits the <em>original</em> path, not the <em>visible</em> path after the
effect. Since the original path you're editing is not visible by itself, the Node tool can optionally highlight it with red
if you turn on the <span class="ui">Show path outline</span> toolbar button (<a href="c12.xhtml#fig12-17">Figure 12-17</a>).
Also, as you will see below, many effects have on-canvas editable handles that you can drag using the Node tool.</p>
			<a id="section13.2.1"/><h3>13.2.1 The Path Effect Editor Dialog</h3>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Path Effect Editor</span> dialog (Shift-Ctrl-7) is Inkscape's main control hub for
path effects (<a href="#fig13-2">Figure 13-2</a>). This is where you apply individual effects to the selected object as well as edit parameters of applied effects.
When an object with one or more path effects is selected, this is where you manage its stack of effects—you can add, rearrange,
or remove effects in the stack.</p>
			<a id="fig13-2"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="14/pe-dialog.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 13-2: The <span class="ui">Path Effect Editor</span> dialog: a 
path with three effects is selected (<span class="ui">Spiro spline</span>, <span class="ui">Stitch Sub-Paths</span>, and <span class="ui">Sketch</span>).</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The dialog works only when you have a single path, shape, or group selected—that is, you cannot edit effects on multiple
paths simultaneously. Once again, the fact that path effects can apply to groups provides a workaround: if there are many paths or shapes
that you want to have the same effect(s) with the same parameters, simply group them together, select the group, and use this
dialog to apply the effect(s) to the group. After that, you will be able to access or edit these effects only if you select the parent group, not 
any of the individual paths inside the group (remember that, for example, the Node tool always selects paths ignoring grouping).</p>
			<p><a id="255"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_255" title="255"/>The list at the top of the dialog shows all the effects applied to the
selected object. The effects are listed top to bottom—that is, the topmost effect in the list is the first to be applied to the
source path. Its output is passed as input to the second one, and so on, until the last listed effect's output is displayed as the final result.</p>
			<p>Any new effect that you add (using the plus-sign button under the list) is placed at the end of the stack. You can move any effect in
the stack up or down with the arrow buttons. Clicking the eye icon before each effect's name disables that effect, forcing Inkscape to bypass it.
To delete an effect from the stack, use the button with the minus sign.</p>
			<p>The panel below the list is where you edit the parameters of the effect selected in the list.
These may be run-of-the-mill checkboxes or drop-down lists, but some effect parameters belong to more interesting types:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Numbers</em> can be either integers or fractional, depending on the nature of
the parameter. When a number denotes a distance, there is usually a unit selector as well.</li>
				<li>
					If an effect uses a random number, the corresponding <em>random number parameter</em> gives the range
in which the random values must fall (see <a href="#fig13-3">Figure 13-3</a>). The dice button to the right re-randomizes (technically, <em>reseeds</em>) the random
values controlled by this parameter.<a id="fig13-3"/><figure>
						<img alt="" src="14/pe-param-random.svg.png"/>
						<figcaption>
							<p>Figure 13-3: A random number parameter of a path effect</p>
						</figcaption>
					</figure>
					</li>
				<li><em>Link parameters</em> are used when one path's effect uses some other path as
one of its parameters, as shown in <a href="#fig13-4">Figure 13-4</a>. That <em>linked path</em> can be a separate object located somewhere 
on the canvas (in the same document), or it can be a path stored entirely within the path effect and not visible in the document.<a id="fig13-4"/><figure>
						<img alt="" src="14/pe-param-link.svg.png"/>
						<figcaption>
							<p>Figure 13-4: A link parameter of a path effect</p>

					</figure>
					</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each link parameter displays a row of four buttons:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><span class="ui">Edit</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Switches Inkscape to the Node tool and lets you edit that
linked parameter path—whether it is a separate object or a path stored inside the 
effect (<a href="#fig13-5">Figure 13-5</a>). The parameter path is shown as a dark green outline.</p>
					<p>
						This is the same as if you manually switch to the Node tool and click the<span class="ui">Show next editable path effect parameter</span> button on the controls bar (see <a href="c12.xhtml#fig12-17">Figure 12-17</a>)
to navigate to this specific linked parameter path (as there may be several, depending on the effect).</p>

the effect to its original in the document. Now, editing the path you had copied will

				</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>
				Some effects can only <em>link</em> to another path in the document, not store it inside,
so they don't have the <span class="ui">Copy</span> and <span class="ui">Paste</span> buttons (for example, the <span class="ui">Clone original</span> effect, <a href="#section13.3.5.1">13.3.5.1</a>).</p>
			<p>Apart from the numeric controls in the dialog, some path effects allow you to edit
their parameters visually by on-canvas handles accessible in the Node tool and the shape tools (you'll see examples of this as I discuss specific effects).
These handles are often white and diamond-shaped, but they can be of any color or shape
so long as they do not get confused with the path nodes and node handles that are also editable in that tool.
Hovering your mouse over a path effect handle will usually show some useful hint in the status bar.</p>
			<p>
				At the bottom of the parameters panel, there is a folded section titled <span class="ui">Set default parameters</span>.
In it, you can make the current value of any of the effect's parameters its default value. The default
value will then be used when you apply this specific effect to new objects.</p>
			<a id="section13.3"/><h2>13.3 A Guide to Inkscape Path Effects</h2>
			<p>Path effects remain one of the active growth areas in Inkscape development, and 
the list of effects supported by the program expands with each new version.
Unfortunately, this also means that path effects are a "work in progress" more so than the rest of Inkscape.
Some of the effects are marked "experimental," but even among the non-experimental ones,
not all effects are polished and reliable enough for a more than occasional use.</p>
			<p>
				This section lists and explains, with examples, the most useful and usable path effects in the latest version of Inkscape, grouped by topic. <a href="#fig13-6">Figure 13-6</a> shows what you see when you click the plus-sign button in the <span class="ui">Path Effect Editor</span> dialog to add a new effect.</p>

			<h3>
				13.3.1 <a id="257"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_257" title="257"/>Stroke Shaping Effects</h3>
			<p>
				Historically, what later evolved into Inkscape path effects was first inspired by the desire to have paths stroked by something more
interesting and expressive than the standard same-width SVG stroke—to have editable <em>vector brushes</em>. Now, Inkscape offers two
different approaches to this, described in this and the following sections; each approach has at least two implementations as distinct path effects.</p>
			<a id="section13.3.1.1"/><h4>13.3.1.1 Power Stroke</h4>
			<p>
				Imagine that your stroked path has additional handles along its length,
and you can drag any of them laterally to make the path wider or narrower in this area. That's exactly what the <span class="ui">Power stroke</span> effect offers: a variable-width
stroke whose profile you can adjust interactively by dragging onscreen handles (in the Node tool). Just as with a regular stroke, you can also adjust
cap (<a href="c09.xhtml#section9.3">9.3</a>) and join types (<a href="c09.xhtml#section9.2">9.2</a>), as well as play with various interpolation and smoothness settings.</p>
			<p><span class="ui">Power stroke</span> is what the Pencil tool applies to paths it creates in the pressure-sensitive mode (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.1.2.2">14.1.2.2</a>). However, as with any other path effect, you can
also assign it to any path manually. Just select a path, click the plus-sign button in the <span class="ui"><strong>Path Effect Editor</strong></span> dialog, and
select <span class="ui"><strong>Power stroke</strong></span> in the list (<a href="#fig13-6">Figure 13-6</a>). This creates a power stroke with (initially) three purple-colored<span class="ui">Power stroke</span> handles along the path. Switch to the Node tool and drag any of them to see how the path responds (<a href="#fig13-7">Figure 13-7</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig13-7"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="14/pe-powerstroke.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 13-7: The <span class="ui">Power stroke</span> effect</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Of the parameters of the effect, the most useful are the <span class="ui">Width factor</span>, which uniformly scales the stroke width at all handles, and the <span class="ui">Cap</span>
type that you can select for the start and end nodes separately. The default <span class="ui">Zero width</span> cap smoothly tapers out the stroke from the first/last purple
handle to the end of <a id="258"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_258" title="258"/>the path, whereas the <span class="ui">Butt</span>, <span class="ui">Round</span>, and <span class="ui">Peak</span> caps keep it the same width from the ultimate handle to the end.</p>
			<p>If you need more purple handles to shape your stroke, Ctrl-click any of them and then drag away the new handle that gets created in the same spot.
To delete a handle, Ctrl-Alt-click it.</p>
			<a id="section13.3.1.2"/><h4>13.3.1.2 Taper Stroke</h4>
			<p>
				A simpler variation of <span class="ui">Power stroke</span> is the <span class="ui">Taper stroke</span> effect shown in <a href="#fig13-8">Figure 13-8</a>. Instead of arbitrary shaping, all it does is taper off the ends of a stroke—but
this is good enough for many use cases. This effect displays two round handles that can move only along the path's centerline, indicating the points where the path
begins to narrow down. The <span class="ui">Taper smoothing</span> parameter lets you vary the tapering from triangular (0) to smoothly elliptic (1).</p>
			<a id="fig13-8"/><figure>

					<p>
						Assigning <span class="ui">Power stroke</span> or <span class="ui">Taper stroke</span> to a plain stroked path removes stroke paint but adds fill paint of the same color. That's because from the SVG viewpoint, such a shaped stroke is a filled path; if you want to change its color, assign it to fill, not stroke. To preserve the original path's fill, Inkscape adds a fill-between path linked to the original path (<a href="#section13.3.5.5">13.3.5.5</a>).</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>
				The biggest problem with both <span class="ui">Taper stroke</span> and <span class="ui">Power stroke</span> is that they are tied to the positions of the nodes in a path, instead of the distance
along that path. For instance, the numeric start/end offsets in <span class="ui">Taper stroke</span> are measured in the units of the first/last internode distance—so that
when <span class="ui">Start offset</span> is 1, the start tapering handle coincides with the <em>second</em> node on the path.
Many path operations, such as <span class="ui">Simplify</span> (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.3">12.3</a>), do not preserve node positions, which makes <span class="ui">Taper stroke</span> and <span class="ui">Power stroke</span> behave unpredictably.</p>
			<a id="section13.3.2"/><h3>
				13.3.2 <a id="259"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_259" title="259"/>Path-Bending Effects</h3>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Pattern Along Path</span> and <span class="ui">Bend</span> effects implement a different approach to editable vector brushes (<a href="#fig13-9">Figure 13-9</a>).
They both take one path (called the <em>pattern</em>) and bend and/or stretch it along another path (called the <em>skeleton</em>).
As usual with path effects, both the skeleton path and the pattern remain editable at any time, with the result updated live.</p>
			<a id="fig13-9"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="14/pe-pattern.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 13-9: Bending a pattern along a skeleton</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				This is also used by the Pencil tool: instead of a <span class="ui">Power stroke</span> controlled by a pressure-sensitive tablet pen, you can assign a
predefined fixed shape to your Pencil strokes (see <a href="c14.xhtml#fig14-12">Figure 14-12</a> for an example). You can also take an existing drawing made with plain SVG strokes and try applying various patterns to its paths.</p>
			<a id="section13.3.2.1"/><h4>13.3.2.1 Pattern Along Path</h4>
			<p>
				The main difference between the <span class="ui">Pattern Along Path</span> and <span class="ui">Bend</span> effects is which path is the skeleton and which is the pattern.
In <span class="ui">Pattern Along Path</span>, the path you're applying the effect to
is the skeleton, and the pattern is linked up as a link parameter.</p>
			<p><a id="260"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_260" title="260"/>This effect
is ideal for simple, possibly repeated, patterns applied to arbitrarily complex skeletons. The
linked pattern path can be either an independent path object in the document or a path
stored inside the effect itself. The result gets the style of the skeleton. This is the
effect used by the <span class="ui">Shape</span> option in the Pen and Pencil tools (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.1.5">14.1.5</a>).</p>
			<p>
				Once you apply <span class="ui">Pattern Along Path</span> to a skeleton path, you need to supply the
pattern using the <span class="ui">Pattern source</span> link parameter. The <span class="ui">Edit</span> button does
not work unless you paste or link some pattern path first, so the usual sequence of
operations is this: select a pattern path, copy it (Ctrl-C), select a
skeleton path, assign <span class="ui"><strong>Pattern Along Path</strong></span> to it, and paste or link
the pattern to it, as shown in <a href="#fig13-10">Figure 13-10</a>. You can also draw paths with the copied pattern applied to
them automatically if you choose <span class="ui">From clipboard</span> in the<span class="ui">Shape</span> list in the Pen or Pencil tools.</p>

				The <span class="ui">Pattern Along Path</span> effect can use one of the following <em>repeat modes</em>:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><span class="ui">Single</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Places a single copy of the pattern along the skeleton, from the start node, without
stretching it. If the pattern is shorter than the skeleton, it will only cover part
of the skeleton's length; if the pattern is so long that it does not fit even once, it will
not be applied.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><span class="ui">Single, stretched</span> <span class="rm">(default)</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>

			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Pattern Along Path</span> effect also allows you to adjust some <em>distance parameters</em>:</p>

				<dt><span class="ui">Spacing</span> <span class="rm">(only for repeated modes)</span></dt>

				</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>
				These offsets and spacing parameters are, by default, in absolute <code>px</code> units.
By checking the <span class="ui">Offset in units of pattern size</span> checkbox, you can express them as multipliers
of the pattern size—for example, a tangential offset of 0.5 will shift the pattern along
the skeleton by half the pattern's width, as <a href="#fig13-12">Figure 13-12</a> demonstrates.</p>

			<h4>13.3.2.2 Bend</h4>
			<p>
				In <span class="ui">Bend</span>, the path you're applying the effect to is the
pattern, whereas the skeleton is linked up using a link parameter. This is more
convenient when you have a complex pattern that you want to curve lightly along a
simple skeleton path that can be shared by several bent paths.
Similarly, the linked skeleton path can be either
an independent path in the document or a path stored inside the effect itself. The
result gets the style of the pattern.</p>
			<p>
				For this effect, you start with the pattern, apply the effect, and use the <span class="ui">Bend</span> link
parameter to link to a skeleton. Unlike <span class="ui">Pattern Along Path</span>, however, <span class="ui">Bend</span> provides
a default two-node skeleton path that stretches along the horizontal axis of your
pattern—so you can at once use the <span class="ui">Edit</span> button to edit that skeleton (<a href="#fig13-15">Figure 13-15</a>).
Or you can paste a skeleton (which may itself have some path effect applied to it) from the
clipboard, or link to a copied path in the clipboard.</p>

			<h3>
				13.3.3 <a id="263"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_263" title="263"/>Deformation Effects</h3>
			<p>
				Effects in this group create an editable external frame on your path, and you can then edit that frame
to deform or distort the path in various ways. You will need this, for example, when inscribing a complex shape
into a 3D scene (perspective distortion) or sticking a label onto a curvilinear bottle (lattice or envelope deformation).
As with all other path effects, these deformations will work on a group as well as on an individual path, and the group
can contain all kinds of differently styled objects (even though any non-paths and non-shapes in that group,
such as bitmaps or text not converted to paths, will <em>not</em> be distorted by the effect).</p>
			<a id="section13.3.3.1"/><h4>13.3.3.1 Envelope</h4>
			<p>
				The simplest effect in this group, <span class="ui">Envelope Deformation</span>, creates a rectangular envelope
whose four sides can each be edited as Bézier curves. 
The effect treats the sides as four individual helper
paths ("bend paths"), which is slightly inconvenient: you need to click the<span class="ui">Edit</span> buttons for each side in turn to curve all four sides. The<span class="ui">Copy</span> and <span class="ui">Paste</span> buttons allow you to transfer the shape of the envelope from one object to another, but
this also requires four separate copy/paste operations. On the other hand, the four sides being separate means they need
not necessarily touch each other, which allows for some additional distortive flexibility, as shown in <a href="#fig13-16">Figure 13-16</a>.</p>

			<a id="section13.3.3.2"/>
			<h4>13.3.3.2 Lattice</h4>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Lattice Deformation</span> effect is a more complex variation of the same idea. It creates a five-by-five lattice of control points
that you can drag around individually (also in the Node tool), which allows for more sophisticated and detailed distortions (<a href="#fig13-17">Figure 13-17</a>).</p>
			<p>
				Handling
that many points manually may be tricky, so the effect offers some ways to simplify the workflow: the<span class="ui">Mirror movements in horizontal/vertical</span> parameters make the lattice symmetric so you need to shape only one half of it, and<span class="ui">Use only perimeter</span> removes the inner points altogether, limiting the lattice to the 16 points on its perimeter.
The <span class="ui">Reset grid</span> button lets you clear any botched edits of the lattice and start over.</p>

				Finally, the <span class="ui">Perspective Transformation</span> effect is specialized for 3D-like transformations of paths—for example, this is
what you would use to place a word of text on the side of a 3D box (<a href="c11.xhtml#section11.3">11.3</a>). Here, the envelope has only four corner nodes and
its sides cannot be curved, as <a href="#fig13-18">Figure 13-18</a> demonstrates. The effect's parameters allow you to set the coordinates of the four points numerically or make the
envelope symmetric.</p>

			<h3>13.3.4 Artistic Effects</h3>
			<p>Effects in this group strive to make objects look less geometric and more organic or freehand-drawn. Usually, this involves an element
of randomness.</p>
			<a id="section13.3.4.1"/><h4>13.3.4.1 Sketch</h4>
			<p><span class="ui">Sketch</span> is an artistic effect that turns a path into a sketch-like drawing
made of multiple strokes, as if drafted on paper by an artist trying to grope for the perfect shape (<a href="#fig13-19">Figure 13-19</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig13-19"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="14/pe-sketch.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 13-19: The <span class="ui">Sketch</span> effect</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				To make sense of this complex effect's parameters, note that the
sketch consists of two types of artifacts: approximating strokes and construction
lines. The <em>approximating strokes</em> cover the entire path; they are typically
curvilinear, <a id="265"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_265" title="265"/>more or less parallel to the original path (with certain tremor), and
travel at some distance from it. The <em>construction
lines</em>, on the other hand, identify and emphasize the straight or almost straight segments
of the path by drawing straight lines that extend each such segment on both sides.</p>
			<p>For the approximating strokes, you can change the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The average <em>number</em> of parallel strokes at each point of the path (default is
five). Set this parameter to 0 to hide approximating strokes (leaving only construction lines). Low
values make the sketch airy and tentative; increasing the number makes it bolder and
noisier, as shown in <a href="#fig13-20">Figure 13-20</a>.<a id="fig13-20"/><figure>

					</li>
				<li>
					The maximum <em>length</em> of strokes (in <code>px</code> units) and the range of the random length <span class="ui">variation</span>
(relative to the maximum length).</li>
				<li>
					The maximum <em>overlapping</em> of subsequent strokes (in <code>px</code> units) and the range of the random<span class="ui">variation</span> of this parameter (relative to the maximum overlap value).</li>
				<li><a id="266"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_266" title="266"/>The <em>end tolerance</em>, which affects how close the approximating strokes follow the
original path.</li>
				<li>
					The average <em>offset</em> of the approximating strokes from the original path; by varying
this parameter, you can make the sketch either neat and tight or wide and ruffled.</li>
				<li>
					The maximum <em>tremble</em> and its <em>frequency</em>; these control how the strokes oscillate
around the original path (<a href="#fig13-21">Figure 13-21</a>). Increasing the maximum tremble ruffles the sketch, similar to
increasing offset but more randomly. Increasing the frequency makes the sketch lines
look rougher by making them tremble on a smaller scale.<a id="fig13-21"/><figure>

							<p>Figure 13-21: Changing the tremble frequency of

					</figure>
					</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For the construction lines, you can change the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The total (not average) <em>number</em> of lines in the sketch (the default is five).
Set this to 0 to suppress construction lines, leaving only approximating strokes.</li>
				<li>
					The <em>scale</em> parameter, which tells how far the ends of the construction lines can go
beyond the ends of the straight (or approximately straight) segments of the path.</li>
				<li>
					The maximum <em>length</em>, and its random <em>variation</em>, which set the upper limit on the
length of construction lines (<a href="#fig13-22">Figure 13-22</a>).</li>

			<h4>13.3.4.2 Hatches</h4>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Hatches</span> effect, unlike everything else you've seen so far, focuses on the fill of the path, not its stroke.
It creates a wiggly line that fills the path to create an impression of freehand artistic hatching.</p>
			<p><a id="267"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_267" title="267"/>The basic parameters of the hatching are controlled by onscreen handles, editable in the Node tool. There are two
pairs of handles: the green pair controls the density (frequency) of the hatching and its slant, while the yellow pair
bends the hatching lines into arcs. In each pair, the round handle is the base (which can be placed anywhere), and the diamond
handle controls its parameter by its position relative to the base, as shown in <a href="#fig13-23">Figure 13-23</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig13-23"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="14/pe-hatches.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 13-23: The <span class="ui">Hatches</span> effect and its control handles</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The rest of the parameters of this complex effect control various aspects of the hatching shape. <span class="ui">Frequency randomness</span> controls how
much random variation is added to the density of the strokes; the smaller this value, the more uniform is the density of the hatching.</p>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">1st side</span> and <span class="ui">2nd side</span> in the parameter labels refer to the two opposite series of bends of the hatching wiggle—for example,
bottom and top, if hatching is oriented vertically.
Thus, <span class="ui">Magnitude jitter, 1st side</span> controls how random the position of each bend is at the bottom of the hatching—that is,
how closely the hatching tracks the edge of the original path at the bottom.</p>
			<p><span class="ui">Parallelism jitter</span> adds randomness to the direction of the
wiggle strokes, and <span class="ui">Half-turn smoothness</span> allows you to vary the bends from sharp angles to circular arcs. Finally, <span class="ui">Thickness</span> values
change how narrow or wide the hatching strokes are in various parts. <a href="#fig13-24">Figure 13-24</a> shows some examples.</p>

			<h4>
				13.3.4.3 <a id="268"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_268" title="268"/>Roughen</h4>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Roughen</span> effect is the general-purpose noise component in the path effects ecosystem. It subdivides the Bézier curves of a path
into shorter segments and randomly displaces the nodes and node handles (<a href="#fig13-25">Figure 13-25</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig13-25"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="14/pe-roughen.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 13-25: The <span class="ui">Roughen</span> effect</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The subdividing is done in one of two ways: either specify the maximum segment size or give the number of segments
into which to break each Bézier of the original path. The first approach (the default) is better in that it does not
depend on the nodes of the original path and produces segments of approximately equal size.</p>
			<p><a id="269"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_269" title="269"/>Next, you get to choose by how much to jitter the nodes. <span class="ui">Maximum displacement</span>
parameters limit this from
above—but if you tick the <span class="ui">Fixed displacement</span> checkbox, it also limits the movement of the nodes
by 1/3 of the (subdivided) segment length. That is, if you want to jitter nodes by 10 px, you need to put 10 into the<span class="ui">Maximum displacement</span> fields and also uncheck <span class="ui">Fixed displacement</span>. With <span class="ui">Shift nodes</span> unchecked,
the effect only randomly rotates the handles of the Bézier segments but does not move the nodes themselves.</p>
			<a id="section13.3.4.4"/><h4>13.3.4.4 Simplify</h4>
			<p>
				You've already met <span class="ui">Simplify</span> (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.3">12.3</a>) as a one-time destructive command. Now, meet its tamer, more cooperative, and fully
reversible cousin: the <span class="ui">Simplify</span> path effect.</p>
			<p>
				Simplifying is a powerful concept. You take a path and ask Inkscape to redraw it from scratch, without looking at the original nodes but trying to
preserve the overall shape—with some simplification. The result may be more or less useful, but it rarely fails to amuse. It makes sense to
group <span class="ui">Simplify</span> together with <span class="ui">Roughen</span> because they act in directly opposite ways—although, of course, simplifying a roughened path will not
give you the exact original, but just a different (and subtler) kind of artistic distortion, as shown in <a href="#fig13-26">Figure 13-26</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig13-26"/><figure>

						Figure 13-26: The <span class="ui">Simplify</span> effect</p>

				The effect's parameters worth fiddling with include the simplification threshold and the number of passes. (The <span class="ui">Helper size</span> is best set to 0; I could
not find any use for the helper lines that this effect shows on canvas.)</p>
			<p>
				Sometimes, it makes just as much sense to overlay <span class="ui">Roughen</span> on top of <span class="ui">Simplify</span>, so that <span class="ui">Simplify</span> creates a characteristic organic shape to which <span class="ui">Roughen</span>
adds texture, as <a href="#fig13-27">Figure 13-27</a> demonstrates.</p>

			<p>A number of effects, instead of distorting the source path, simply copy or multiply it in various useful ways.</p>
			<a id="section13.3.5.1"/>
			<h4>13.3.5.1 Clone Original</h4>
			<p>
				This is a generic clone effect for copying one path's nodes (more precisely, <em>path data</em>, which includes positions and types of all nodes
and handles) to another path. Unlike the standard SVG clones (<a href="c16.xhtml#ch16">Chapter 16</a>), this
effect lets you copy only the path data, with or without its path effects. The cloned path is still a path, so you can apply some other effects
to it on top of the <span class="ui">Clone original</span>.
For example, you can have an original path that uses <span class="ui">Spiro spline</span> and a number of its clones that have varying levels of <span class="ui">Roughen</span> or <span class="ui">Simplify</span>
applied on top. This effect also allows you to specify precisely which attributes or CSS properties (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.1">8.1</a>) the clone
object gets from the original.</p>
			<p>
				You can even link a path to a text object without converting it to a path. This way, the text remains editable as text, but you also have an automatically identical path with the <span class="ui">Clone original</span> effect that can have any other path effects stacked on top.</p>
			<p>
				To use it, you first need to have a path object that will become a clone (its own path data will be discarded). Assign the <span class="ui"><strong>Clone original</strong></span> effect to it.
Then, select and copy (Ctrl-C) the path or text you want to clone. Then, select the path with the <span class="ui"><strong>Clone original</strong></span> effect again and click
the <span class="ui"><strong>Link to item</strong></span> button in its parameters panel. (The <span class="ui">Select original</span> button next to it selects the object that this one clones from.)
Then, choose one of the <span class="ui"><strong>Shape</strong></span> options that control exactly what path data will be copied:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="ui">With LPE's</span> (default): the visible path with all its path effects.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Without LPE's</span>: the path before any path effects.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Spiro or BSpline Only</span>: the path with only its spline effects (<a href="#section13.3.7">13.3.7</a>) applied, if any.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">No Shape</span>: nothing is copied.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Finally, you can specify (as comma-separated lists) the attributes and CSS properties that the clone will get from the original path. A separate checkbox controls
the copying of transformations (<a href="c06.xhtml#ch6">Chapter 6</a>); if it is unchecked, the clone will always be positioned exactly over (or under, depending on z-order) the original.</p>
			<a id="section13.3.5.2"/><h4>
				13.3.5.2 Slice <span class="NoteHead">[1.1]</span></h4>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Slice</span>
effect cuts a path (or shape or group) into two halves with a straight cut. This "sawing a person in half" trick produces two separate paths that you can move, transform, and style
independently (<a href="#fig13-28">Figure 13-28</a>).
Of the two resulting paths, one (with the <span class="ui">Slice</span> effect applied) stores and lets you edit the entire path but shows only one half of it.
The other path has no path effects of its own, but when you edit the first path, it updates automatically to reflect the changes. You can adjust the cut line's position and angle with the handles.</p>

			<h4>
				13.3.5.3 <a id="271"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_271" title="271"/>Mirror Symmetry</h4>
			<p>
				This effect takes the original path and creates a copy of it mirrored around an axis of symmetry that
you can adjust interactively via onscreen handles in the Node tool (<a href="#fig13-29">Figure 13-29</a>). The length of the mirror axis is
irrelevant; only its position and direction matter. Of the three
handles on the mirror axis, the end ones rotate it while the central one moves it parallel to itself.</p>

				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 13-29: The <span class="ui">Mirror symmetry</span> effect</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				By default, the effect creates the copy as a subpath of the original path, so in the areas where the original
and the copy overlap, the paint is determined by the fill rule (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.1.2">12.1.2</a>). If you enable <span class="ui">Fuse paths</span>, the paths will never
overlap because they will be clipped by the mirror axis; if you also enable <span class="ui">Fuse opposite sides</span>, clipping itself is mirrored,
so you see only the parts of the path that go <em>beyond</em> the mirror axis (and their reflection). The <span class="ui">Split elements</span> option creates, instead
of a subpath, a separate path element for the mirror copy, which can have a different style; you can manually transform or node-edit
this mirror path—but if you then transform or node-edit the original path, the mirror copy object will synchronize, overriding your changes.</p>
			<p>
				Even such a simple thing as mirror symmetry can produce amazingly deep patterns if applied, for example, to a large complex
star, as <a href="#fig13-30">Figure 13-30</a> demonstrates.</p>

			<p>
				This is a close relative of the <span class="ui">Mirror symmetry</span> effect, except that it creates any number of copies placed on a circle whose center and
starting angle you can adjust via onscreen handles in Node tool. Optionally, you can mirror every second copy. You can also enable
the <span class="ui">Split elements</span> option that creates separate path elements, instead of subpaths, for each copy. Note that adjusting the starting
angle rotates all copies of the path, including the original (even though the Node tool will still show it in its original place, if you enable
the red outline), as shown in <a href="#fig13-31">Figure 13-31</a>.</p>

				13.3.5.5 Fill Between Many <span class="NoteHead">[1.1]</span></h4>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Fill between many</span> effect creates a new path linked to one or more original paths and covering the entire space between
them—as if the ends of those paths were connected by straight line segments to form a single closed path.
The original paths can have some path effects of their own (for example, path-shaping effects). Editing any of the linked paths updates the
fill-between path automatically. This effect is so useful, it even has its own menu command: <span class="ui">Path<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Fill between paths</span>.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>You can't node-edit or transform the fill-between path with the Selector, but you can style it with a fill and/or stroke style of its own.
You can also select and delete it as a separate object without affecting the linked paths.</p>
			<p><a id="273"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_273" title="273"/>Despite having the word <em>many</em> in its name, this effect can be just as useful with a single original path. When you assign <span class="ui">Power stroke</span> or <span class="ui">Taper stroke</span> to a path with fill (<a href="#section13.3.1.1">13.3.1.1</a>), a fill-between path is also created that is linked to the original path, reproducing its original fill style (which otherwise would be lost). This way, you get a shaped stroke and the fill inside it, both updated live when you edit the path with the stroke-shaping effect.</p>
			<a id="section13.3.6"/>
			<h3>13.3.6 VonKoch</h3>
			<p>
				This recursive effect takes the original path and repeats it twice (as
subpaths) with shifting, scaling, and rotating; it then repeats the same operation on
these copies, and so on for the specified number of <em>generations</em>. This is an example of a fractal—a
self-similar shape that looks the same at different levels of zoom.</p>
			<p>
				Three helper paths control the copies' transformations: a <em>reference
segment</em> (initially, running horizontally across the source path) and two <em>generating</em><em>paths</em> (initially, running horizontally across the two first-generation copies), as shown in <a href="#fig13-33">Figure 13-33</a>.</p>

			<p>
				These helper
paths are two-node straight line segments; to edit
them, use the Node tool and click the <span class="ui"><strong>Show next editable path effect parameter</strong></span>
button on its control bar once (for the reference segment) or twice (for the generating paths).</p>
			<a id="section13.3.7"/><h3>
				13.3.7 <a id="274"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_274" title="274"/>Splines</h3>
			<p>
				The word <em>spline</em>, as originally used by shipbuilders, referred to a springy wooden strip that was fixed
in several points and took the most naturally smooth shape given the restrictions. In computer design, a spline
is a mathematical curve that goes through given points and has some desirable properties, such as smoothness and naturalness.</p>
			<p>
				Bézier curves (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.1.4">12.1.4</a>) are one kind of a spline, but there are other kinds too. Bézier curves are flexible and powerful; using them for building paths has many years of tradition behind it. All
modern graphics software supports them in much the same way, and millions
of users are familiar with them. And yet, once you try something better, the disadvantages of Béziers become
obvious.</p>
			<p>
				Via path effects, Inkscape implements
two other spline types: BSplines and Spiro splines. The Pen and Pencil tools can produce BSplines and Spiro paths
directly (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.1.4">14.1.4</a>).</p>
			<a id="section13.3.7.1"/><h4>13.3.7.1 BSpline</h4>
			<p>
				A <em>BSpline</em> is a smooth curve that is inscribed into a polygon that consists of the nodes of the original path (<a href="#fig13-34">Figure 13-34</a>). It does not
go through those node points but rather treats them as posts on a ski run—trying to pass them closely but without
losing speed (that is, without sacrificing smoothness). Only the start and end nodes of the curve lie on the BSpline, while
the smooth interior nodes are <em>off-curve</em>. (In fact, these off-curve nodes behave almost as if they were Bézier handles
of a single monstrous Bézier that can have any number of handles and not just two.)</p>
			<a id="fig13-34"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="14/pe-bspline.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 13-34: Examples of BSplines</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				A BSpline path can also have cusp nodes (which <em>do</em> lie on the curve, as they start or end a curved segment). A node of the
original path that has both Bézier handles of nonzero length becomes an off-curve smooth point of a BSpline;
a node that has at least one of its handles retracted is interpreted as a cusp node. To switch node types in a BSpline,
in the Node tool, use Shift-S (to smooth) and Shift-C twice (to cusp, the first Shift-C just changes the type of the node
and the second actually retracts the handles).</p>
			<p>
				The fact that, with the exception of the first/last and cusp nodes, all other nodes are off-curve is perhaps the biggest
disadvantage of BSplines in practice. Still, if you want a path that always remains naturally smooth and is easier to
manipulate than a sequence of Béziers, the <span class="ui">BSpline</span> effect is worth trying.</p>
			<a id="section13.3.7.2"/><h4>
				13.3.7.2 <a id="275"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_275" title="275"/>Spiro Spline</h4>
			<p><em>Spiro splines</em>, developed by Raph
Levien, are another way of defining curvilinear paths. Spiros take some getting used to, but for certain tasks (such as lettershape
design, <a href="#fig13-35">Figure 13-35</a>), they have a clear advantage over Bézier curves. Compared with BSplines, Spiro
paths are often harder to manipulate—sometimes they're outright cranky—but, in return, they are smooth at an entirely new
level of naturalness.</p>
			<a id="fig13-35"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="14/pe-spiro-letters.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 13-35: Lettershapes created with Spiro
paths</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				A Spiro path is defined by a sequence of nodes. A Spiro path has no off-curve nodes or handles; unlike a BSpline, a Spiro goes
through all of its nodes. The curvature of the path is defined entirely by the positions of the nodes
and their types, as shown in <a href="#fig13-36">Figure 13-36</a>. The path behaves very similarly to the original shipbuilders' <em>spline</em>—a springy rod that is forced to pass
through the given points and assumes the <em>minimum possible curvature</em> to satisfy the requirement.</p>
			<a id="fig13-36"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="14/pe-spiro.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 13-36: Converting a regular path to a Spiro path and
back</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The major selling point of a Spiro path is that it is always very smooth—not 
just superficially or locally smooth, as in having no cusps, but smooth at the level of the entire path,
which you can
approximate with Béziers only by a lot of laborious tweaking. With a Spiro, moving
one node may visibly affect the curve at a distance of several nodes away. This
does take some getting used to but the result may be well worth the effort.</p>
			<p>With Béziers, the main problem is that
each node has not only a position but also its own intrinsic direction and curvature, as defined by its handles.
So, whenever you move a Bézier node around, you
also need to adjust its handles carefully so that the curve remains naturally smooth.
With a BSpline or a Spiro, just move the node wherever you
want the curve to go, and the smoothness is taken care of
automatically.</p>
			<p><a id="276"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_276" title="276"/>To create a Spiro path, select any path and assign the <span class="ui"><strong>Spiro spline</strong></span> path effect to
it. There are no parameters. Each node of your path becomes a point of a Spiro path,
depending on the type of node (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.5.5">12.5.5</a>), as shown in <a href="#fig13-37">Figure 13-37</a>:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Smooth nodes</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Nodes with two collinear Bézier handles are smooth points on the Spiro path. The length and
direction of the Bézier handles on the source path are ignored, so long as they remain collinear (that is, so long as
the node is smooth). Press Shift-S to line up the handles of the selected node to make it smooth.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Half-smooth nodes</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Nodes with one Bézier handle collinear with a straight line segment
on the other side behave exactly the same on a Spiro path: they sit between a
straight line and a curve and force them to join smoothly without a
cusp. If you have a straight line segment on one side of a node, the first
Shift-S will make it half-smooth.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Cusp nodes</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Nodes on the source path become corner points of the Spiro path. They behave like
free hinges on the springy rod, allowing it to bend at any angle. Between two corner
points, the Spiro path is always a straight line. To make a node cusp, press
Shift-C twice (the first Shift-C just changes the type of the node
and the second actually retracts the handles).</p>

sharp changes in direction between points to prevent such instability.</p>

			<a id="section13.3.8"/><h3>13.3.8 Path Utilities</h3>
			<p>This category includes effects that do some useful tweaks to paths that would be time-consuming to do manually.</p>
			<a id="section13.3.8.1"/>
			<h4>13.3.8.1 Corners (Fillet/Chamfer)</h4>
			<p>
				Rounding corners is a very common operation in design and technical drawing. Rectangles have convenient handles for corner
rounding (<a href="c11.xhtml#section11.2.2">11.2.2</a>), but a generic path does not have this luxury. Of course, you can round a path's sharp corner manually, but 
it's a cumbersome task that makes the path harder to edit or transform later. Fortunately, Inkscape has a path effect that
does all the hard work for you and preserves the flexibility of the original path. It's even better than rectangle rounding
because it allows different rounding radii for different corners and supports different rounding profiles!</p>
			<p>
				The term <em>fillet</em> means rounding a corner with an arc, whereas <em>chamfer</em> means cutting a corner with a straight line segment. To make things more
fun, both fillets and chamfers can be <em>inverted</em>—that is, flipped around the corner-cutting diagonal. Chamfers can be multistep—that is,
consisting of more than one straight line segment (and obviously, it's only for multistep chamfers that inverting makes any difference).</p>
			<p>
				You can adjust the size of the fillet/chamfer for any individual node (not necessarily cusp) via onscreen handles in the Node tool, as shown in <a href="#fig13-39">Figure 13-39</a>.
You can also change the <span class="ui">Radius</span> value in the parameters pane; this (as well as any other parameter change, such as corner type)
will by default apply to all nodes of the path but can be limited to a selection of nodes if <span class="ui">Change only selected nodes</span> is on.
The radius can be in absolute units or a percentage of the length of the adjacent segment.</p>

			<h4>
				13.3.8.2 <a id="278"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_278" title="278"/>Knot</h4>
			<p>
				This effect breaks a path into subpaths in order to create gaps between them where the path
(or a group of paths) self-intersects. <a href="#fig13-40">Figure 13-40</a> demonstrates how to turn a stroked path with self-intersections
into a Celtic knot.</p>
			<a id="fig13-40"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="14/pe-knot.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 13-40: The <span class="ui">Knot</span> effect on a group of two paths with self-intersections</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>It need not necessarily be a single self-intersecting path. Remember that you can assign any
path effect to a group of paths—and with Knot, this will force all paths to create gaps where they intersect all
other paths in the same group.</p>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Gap length</span> numeric parameter for this effect specifies the width of each gap, either <span class="ui">In units of stroke width</span> or in document units if this checkbox is off. If you have this effect on a group that includes paths of different stroke width, the <span class="ui">Groups: Inverse</span> parameter ensures that when path A creates a gap crossing path B, it takes the width of path B (and not A) as the base for calculating the gap width.</p>
			<p>
				On canvas, you can control each intersection
individually. In the Node tool, notice that one
of its self-intersections has a diamond-shaped handle and a blue circular indicator
that is open on one side. Click that handle; the indicator flips <a id="279"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_279" title="279"/>to the other side, and
the gap is now created on the <em>other</em> line at the intersection. Click it again, and you close the
intersection, removing any gaps (the indicator is now a solid circle). Clicking the handle further 
cycles through these three states for a given intersection. To control
another intersection, simply drag the handle and drop it onto the intersection
you need.</p>
			<a id="section13.3.9"/><h3>13.3.9 Subpath Manipulations</h3>
			<p>A number of effects focus on the subpaths of the original path and do various interesting things
to them, such as connecting or interpolating.</p>
			<a id="section13.3.9.1"/><h4>13.3.9.1 Stitch Sub-Paths</h4>
			<p>
				The surprisingly useful <span class="ui">Stitch Sub-Paths</span> effect works only for paths with two or
more subpaths (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.1.1">12.1.1</a>). It replaces the source path with a lattice of paths connecting
equispaced points on the subpaths, with the <span class="ui">Number of paths</span> parameter controlling how densely
these connecting paths go. With this effect, you can create all kinds of hair, fur, lattices, moiré
patterns, or "power fields," as shown in <a href="#fig13-41">Figure 13-41</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig13-41"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="14/pe-stitch.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 13-41: Stitching subpaths</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				If a path has three or more subpaths, each pair of subpaths gets its own
connecting lattice (<a href="#fig13-42">Figure 13-42</a>). This means the number of connecting lines literally explodes as
you increase the number of subpaths in the original—so don't try this effect on a
path with too many subpaths or Inkscape may grind to a halt.</p>
			<a id="fig13-42"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="14/pe-stitch-3.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 13-42: Stitching three or more subpaths</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="280"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_280" title="280"/>The connecting lines need not be straight—that is just the default. You can use
the <span class="ui">Stitch path</span> link parameter to paste or link any existing open path
to serve as the template for the stitches, or you can edit that template with the Node tool. The <span class="ui">Scale width</span> parameter scales the stitch path in the direction
perpendicular to its start-end direction (the value of 1 gives it its natural
width). The <span class="ui">Scale width relative to length</span> parameter makes the width of each
stitch depend on the length of that stitch, as shown in <a href="#fig13-43">Figure 13-43</a>.</p>

				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 13-43: Adjusting the width of a curved stitch
path</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Finally, a group of randomization (<span class="ui">variance</span>) parameters allows you to shuffle the
attachment points of the stitches, both along the path (<span class="ui">spacing</span>) and perpendicular to it
(<span class="ui">edge</span>), separately for the beginning and end of each stitch, as <a href="#fig13-44">Figure 13-44</a> demonstrates.</p>

			<a id="section13.3.9.2"/>
			<h4>13.3.9.2 Interpolate Sub-Paths</h4>
			<p>
				This effect is a natural complement for <span class="ui">Stitch Sub-Paths</span>. Instead of drawing lines from one subpath to
another, it draws a number of interpolated subpaths between the original path's subpaths. Just as with<span class="ui">Stitch Sub-Paths</span>, you can node-edit or link to a path that guides the placement of the interpolation steps, as shown in <a href="#fig13-45">Figure 13-45</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig13-45"/><figure>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="281"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_281" title="281"/>For best results,
the subpaths should be similar enough, ideally with the same number of nodes; otherwise, interpolation
may create inexplicable ugly cusps.</p>
			<a id="section13.3.10"/><h3>13.3.10 Boolean Operations</h3>
			<p>
				You're already familiar with Boolean operations on paths (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.2">12.2</a>). They are an essential tool,
but they have a big problem: they are destructive. Once you union two paths, they no longer exist as separable
objects, so you cannot copy or clone one of them for reuse, nor can you node-edit them separately. Some parts of the original
objects (in the case of a union, those areas where the paths overlap) are lost forever.  Once again, path effects are a natural solution.</p>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Boolean operation</span> path effect applied to one path stores a link to another path and makes the first path look
like a result of a Boolean operation (union, cut, division, intersection, difference, or symmetric difference) with the linked path.
The second (linked) path is not destroyed but hidden (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.1">4.1</a>), unless you uncheck the <span class="ui">Hide linked</span>
parameter; however, you can easily select it for editing with the <span class="ui">Select original</span> button in the parameter panel of the effect.</p>
			<p>
				For example, to make the "an" monogram shown in <a href="#fig13-46">Figure 13-46</a>, I assigned the <span class="ui">Boolean operation</span> effect to the "n" path, then selected the "a" path,
copied it, selected "n" again, and pasted it to the effect's <span class="ui">Operand path</span> parameter. The original "a" path is still present in the document
but is hidden.</p>
			<a id="fig13-46"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="14/pe-boolean.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 13-46: The <span class="ui">Boolean operation</span> effect</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				When I select the monogram, the bounding box enframes the entire unioned path, but the Node tool can edit only the
"n" path (as shown by the red outline and highlighted nodes); to edit the "a," I need to click the effect's <span class="ui">Select original</span> button.
Note that both letters were made with <span class="ui">Spiro splines</span> (<a href="#section13.3.7.2">13.3.7.2</a>), so the <span class="ui">Boolean operation</span> effect on "n" is stacked on top of the <span class="ui">Spiro</span> effect.</p>
			<a id="section13.3.11"/><h3>13.3.11 Offset</h3>
			<p>
				You've already seen the regular offset commands (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.4">12.4</a>) that expand (<em>outset</em>) or
contract (<em>inset</em>) a path perpendicular to its direction at each point.
Just as with plain Boolean operations, those commands are destructive—once you offset a path, you lose the original.
Inkscape now offers a nondestructive way to achieve the same result.</p>
			<p><a id="282"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_282" title="282"/>The <span class="ui">Offset</span> path effect displays, in the Node tool, a single round handle on the path. You
can drag that handle to any point on the path where it's convenient; what matters for the offset is its
distance from the closest point on the original path. You can also specify the amount of offset numerically
with the <span class="ui">Offset</span> parameter.</p>
			<p>
				In addition, you can choose the type of join and the miter limit (compare <a href="c09.xhtml#section9.2">9.2</a>).
An outset path is similar to what you would get by adding a stroke to the original path, so these parameters give you
access to the properties of this imaginary stroke. In particular, by setting <span class="ui">Join</span> to <span class="ui">Miter</span>, you 
make sure the sharp corners of the original path remain sharp in the outset path, as shown in <a href="#fig13-47">Figure 13-47</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig13-47"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="14/pe-offset.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 13-47: The <span class="ui">Offset</span> path effect</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				For historical reasons, Inkscape has a couple more implementations of path offsets, also interactive and adjustable on canvas but not using path effects (they were added to the program before the path effects were invented). These are the <span class="ui">Dynamic Offset</span> and <span class="ui">Linked Offset</span> commands in the <span class="ui">Path</span> menu and their shortcuts (Ctrl-J and Ctrl-Alt-J, correspondingly). A <span class="ui">Dynamic Offset</span> is very similar to the <span class="ui">Offset</span> path effect, whereas a <span class="ui">Linked Offset</span> can be emulated by the <span class="ui">Offset</span> effect on top of the <span class="ui">Clone original</span> effect (<a href="#section13.3.5.1">13.3.5.1</a>). I see no reason to use these obsolete implementations now that there is a path effect that does the same thing but better (notably, the path effect can offset an unclosed path without closing it).</p>
				<a id="section13.3.12"/>
				<h3>13.3.12 Power Clip and Power Mask</h3>
			<p>
				Unlike Boolean operations, plain SVG clips and masks (<a href="c18.xhtml#section18.3">18.3</a>) are already nondestructive: you can always recover the original
object by removing the clip or mask. So why reimplement those features as path effects too?</p>
			<p>
				In fact, there's nothing particularly "power" about the <span class="ui">Power clip</span> and <span class="ui">Power mask</span> path effects. They were created with a single
purpose: to enable creating an <em>inverted</em> clip or mask that would reveal what the plain clip or mask hides and vice versa. As such,
they are not even assignable via the <span class="ui">Path Effects</span> dialog; instead, go to the menu and choose <span class="ui"><strong>Object<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Clip<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Set Inverse (LPE)</strong></span>

				13.3.13 <a id="283"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_283" title="283"/>Dashed Stroke</h3>
			<p>
				What on Earth could be improved in standard SVG's dashed strokes (<a href="c09.xhtml#section9.4">9.4</a>)? It turns out, a lot.</p>
			<p>
				In SVG, a dash pattern is specified in units of stroke width, but it is not in any way coordinated with the path itself—its shape or size.
When working with a simple symmetric shape, such as a rectangle, it is annoying when you can't make the dashes meet symmetrically in
the corners or when two opposite and equal sides' dashes are not in sync. The <span class="ui">Dashed Stroke</span> path effects solves all of these
problems.</p>
			<p>
				In this effect, you can tell Inkscape exactly how many dashes you want in your path, not how long they need to be. This way, the dashes always stay in sync
with the shape even when you scale it or change the stroke width. If the <span class="ui">Use segments</span> parameter is on, you get the specified number of dashes
in each segment—that is, between each two nodes of the path; if the segments are not equal, the dashes will have different lengths too.
Turn on <span class="ui"><strong>Equalize dashes</strong></span> to fix this: now the entire path will have dashes of the same length as the shortest of its segments.</p>
			<p>
				The gaps between the dashes are controlled by the <span class="ui">Hole factor</span> parameter that ranges from −1 (all gaps, no dashes) to 1 
(all dashes, no gaps). The default value of zero makes the gaps the same length as the dashes.</p>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Half start/end</span> parameter, on by default, makes each segment start and end with a dash of half width, so that the combined
dashes at the segment boundaries have the same length as elsewhere. When this parameter is off, you will have double-length dashes at each node
between segments (<a href="#fig13-48">Figure 13-48</a>).</p>

					<p>
						Figure 13-48: The <span class="ui">Dashed Stroke</span> path effect</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The biggest drawback of this effect is that, since it emulates dashes by separate subpaths, the path as a whole cannot have a fill because SVG
cannot fill in between subpaths of a path. One solution is to use <span class="ui">Clone original</span> (<a href="#section13.3.5.1">13.3.5.1</a>) to clone the path<em>without</em> the effect and apply the fill you need to that cloned path.</p>
			<a id="section13.3.14"/><h3>13.3.14 Helper Effects</h3>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Bounding Box</span> and <span class="ui">Show handles</span> effects are useful when you need to create lasting visualizations of your paths—for example, when
you're creating illustrations for a book such as this one. The <span class="ui">Bounding Box</span> effect turns one path (whose path data will be discarded) into a
dynamically updated rectangular bounding <a id="284"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_284" title="284"/>box of another (linked) path. The <span class="ui">Show handles</span> effect adds subpaths imitating nodes and node
handles of the path as they are shown in the Node tool.</p>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Ruler</span> effect turns any path (not necessarily straight) into a ruler with minor and major marks and with adjustable size and spacing.
The <span class="ui">Measure</span> effect is a complex engine for creating measurements on segments of a path; this partly overlaps with what the
Measure tool does (<a href="c06.xhtml#section6.9.6">6.9.6</a>) but is more powerful for its specific task—with a ton of options for colors, sizes,
precision, and label formatting, as shown in <a href="#fig13-49">Figure 13-49</a>.</p>

			<h3>13.3.15 Geometric Constructions</h3>
			<p>
				A final group of path effects will help you do some simple interactive geometric constructions (<a href="#fig13-50">Figure 13-50</a>). 
In the <span class="ui">Path Effects</span> dialog, they are currently marked as "experimental" and hidden by
default.</p>
			<a id="fig13-50"/><figure>

			<dl>
				<dt><span class="ui">Circle by three points</span></dt> <dd>
					<p>Using the Pen, click three times to create a three-point path, assign this effect, and Inkscape will create a circle that passes through those three points. A circle is
never clipped—even though it can potentially be infinite when the three lines are on the same straight
line (in practice, placing the points on the same line makes the effect misbehave). This path effect
has no parameters.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><span class="ui"><a id="285"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_285" title="285"/>Circle by center and radius</span></dt> <dd>
					<p>The first node of the path gives the center, and the last one sets the radius. This
path effect has no parameters.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><span class="ui">Parallel</span></dt> <dd>
					<p>
						This effect creates a line
running through an <em>anchor point</em> parallel to the line connecting your path's start and end nodes.
You can move the anchor point via a diamond-shaped handle in the Node tool or via the <span class="ui">Offset</span> parameters of the <span class="ui">Parallel</span>
path effect. To change how far to the left and right of the anchor point you want the parallel line to go, use the <span class="ui"><strong>Length left</strong></span> and <span class="ui"><strong>Length right</strong></span> parameters.</p>
					<p>
						The original path—to which the new line is parallel—becomes invisible when you create the parallel: the parallel is now the
visible path of that object, and the original nodes are editable only in the Node tool. If you need two visible straight lines that are always automatically
parallel to each other, create <em>two</em> lines and make the second one a <span class="ui"><strong>Clone original</strong></span> (<a href="#section13.3.5.1">13.3.5.1</a>) of the first
but choose the <span class="ui"><strong>Without LPE's</strong></span> option. Then, select the first one and turn it into its own parallel using this tool.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><span class="ui">Perpendicular bisector</span></dt> <dd>
					<p>
						This works similar to the <span class="ui">Parallel</span> effect except that instead of a parallel line, it creates a line that is perpendicular to the given segment and goes through
its center.  If you need two lines to be automatically perpendicular to one another,  create a<span class="ui"><strong>Perpendicular bisector</strong></span> on one of them, then open the <span class="ui"><strong>Path Effects</strong></span> dialog, add a <span class="ui"><strong>Clone original</strong></span> effect to it, and move it up before the <span class="ui"><strong>Perpendicular
bisector</strong></span> effect. Finally, select the second line object, copy it, and paste into the <span class="ui"><strong>Link</strong></span> parameter of the <span class="ui"><strong>Clone original</strong></span>.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><span class="ui">Angle bisector</span></dt> <dd>
					<p>
						This works similarly to the <span class="ui">Perpendicular bisector</span> except it bisects an angle created by a three-node path. Just assign this path effect to a
path with three nodes.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><span class="ui">Mirror symmetry</span></dt> <dd>
					<p>
						See <a href="#section13.3.5.3">13.3.5.3</a> for a description of the <span class="ui">Mirror symmetry</span> effect.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><span class="ui"><a id="286"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_286" title="286"/>Ellipse from points</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						This effect adapts
to the number of points in the original path. For two or three points, it creates a circle; for five points, it creates an ellipse that goes exactly through
those five points. For any other number of points, the effect can't be exact, but it tries as best it can, creating an <em>approximate</em> ellipse that minimizes the deviations
from all points (<a href="#fig13-51">Figure 13-51</a>).</p>
					<p>
						Optionally, you can add
a frame or axes to the ellipse.
If you set the <span class="ui">Method</span> parameter to <span class="ui">Force circle</span>, the effect will always create a circle, either exact or approximate.</p>

			<h2>13.4 Path Extensions</h2>
			<p>
				In the <span class="ui">Extensions<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Generate from Path</span>, <span class="ui">Extensions<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Modify Path</span>, and <span class="ui">Extensions<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Visualize Path</span> submenus,  Inkscape has a number of extensions (<a href="c19.xhtml#ch19">Chapter 19</a>) that work with paths. 
Through the years, many of them
have been reimplemented as path effects—with
on-canvas editability, better integration with the rest of the program, and, typically, richer options. 
However, Inkscape still includes most of the obsoleted  extensions.</p>
			<p>
				One reason is that an extension, as a one-off operation, does not introduce any non-SVG attributes into 
the document, so it is not prone to potential incompatibilities that
path effects may face (<a href="#section13.1">13.1</a>).
Extensions are also much easier for curious Inkscape users to study, experiment with, and develop in new directions.
Finally, some of these extensions still have some unique capabilities or options not available in path effects.</p>
			<a id="section13.4.1"/><h3>13.4.1 The Generate from Path Submenu</h3>
			<a id="section13.4.1.1"/><h4>13.4.1.1 Inset/Outset Halo</h4>
			<p>
				This extension adds to the selected path a specified number
of inset or outset paths (<span class="ui">Steps</span>), at a <span class="ui">Width</span> from each other, each further offset having lower
and lower opacity (<a href="#fig13-52">Figure 13-52</a>).</p>

			<h4>
				13.4.1.2 <a id="287"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_287" title="287"/>Extrude, Motion</h4>
			<p>
				These extensions create a primitive 3D effect by extruding the selected path at a
given angle to a given distance. The result is a group of two objects, one
being the original path and the other its extrusion skirt that you can style
differently. A similar <span class="ui">Extrude</span> path effect is currently marked as experimental (<a href="#fig13-53">Figure 13-53</a>).</p>

			</figure>
			<a id="section13.4.1.3"/>
			<h4>13.4.1.3 Interpolate</h4>
			<p>
				This extension creates an interpolation, or <em>blend</em>, between two paths—a 
set of smooth transition steps when you transform one path into the other.
You can specify the number of the <span class="ui">Interpolation steps</span> and the <span class="ui">Exponent</span>, which,
if different from the default 0, shifts the blend toward one of the ends, as shown in <a href="#fig13-54">Figure 13-54</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig13-54"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="14/pe-interpolate.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 13-54: The <span class="ui">Interpolate</span> extension</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				This is similar to the <span class="ui">Interpolate Sub-Paths</span> effect (<a href="#section13.3.9">13.3.9</a>).  Unlike the path effect, however, this extension has the <span class="ui">Interpolate style</span> option that paints  intermediate steps with intermediate colors.</p>
			<p>
				The extension generates the intermediate steps as
a group of paths; the <span class="ui">Duplicate endpaths</span> option adds copies of the original
paths to this group as well. Since interpolation always connects beginnings and ends of the
two paths, you may need to reverse one of the paths (<span class="ui">Path<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Reverse</span>) in order 
to get the result you want.</p>
			<a id="section13.4.1.4"/><h4>
				13.4.1.4 <a id="288"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_288" title="288"/>Pattern Along Path</h4>
			<p>
				This is similar to the path effect of the same name (<a href="#section13.3.2">13.3.2</a>) and, in fact, is the first version of this functionality created before path effects were invented. The extension has one
advantage compared to the path effect: it can use a group of objects (each with its own
style) as the pattern; in the path effect, you are limited to a single-pattern
path. To use the extension, select the pattern path or group and the skeleton path (the
pattern must be on top of the skeleton in z-order), and apply the command; the options are similar to those for the corresponding path effect.</p>
			<a id="section13.4.1.5"/><h4>13.4.1.5 Voronoi Diagram and Voronoi Pattern</h4>
			<p>
				A Voronoi diagram (also used by the pixel tracer, <a href="c18.xhtml#section18.5.2.6">18.5.2.6</a>) is a tessellation of a plane into polygons in such a way that each point on a polygon is closer to the center of its own polygon than to the centers of other polygons (<a href="#fig13-55">Figure 13-55</a>).</p>
				<a id="fig13-55"/>

					<p>Figure 13-55: Voronoi diagrams from selected 3D boxes (left) and as pattern on a circle (right)</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The first of these extensions generates such a tessellation from the centers of all selected objects; the second one creates a random Voronoi pattern and assigns it to the selected objects as fill (and you can then use it on other objects as well, see <a href="c10.xhtml#section10.8">10.8</a> for details).</p>

				<h3>13.4.2 The Modify Path Submenu</h3>
				<a id="section13.4.2.1"/>
				<h4>13.4.2.1 Add Nodes</h4>
			<p>
				This useful extension creates extra nodes in a path without changing its
shape. You can specify either the maximum allowed distance between adjacent nodes or the
number of segments into which each segment will be divided. <a href="c09.xhtml#fig9-11">Figure 9-11</a> shows this extension in
action.</p>
			<a id="section13.4.2.2"/><h4>13.4.2.2 Flatten Béziers and Straighten Segments</h4>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Flatten Béziers</span> extension approximates each Bézier curve in the selected path with a
sequence of straight line segments; higher <span class="ui">Flatness</span> values result in rougher
approximation with fewer segments. The <span class="ui">Straighten Segments</span> simply shortens all
Bézier handles by the given percent, so that setting this to 100 percent turns
each Bézier curve into a straight line segment, as <a href="#fig13-56">Figure 13-56</a> demonstrates.</p>

			<h4>
				13.4.2.3 <a id="289"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_289" title="289"/>Jitter Nodes</h4>
			<p>
				This extension randomizes the selected paths by displacing all nodes in random
directions and at random distances, limited by the <span class="ui">Maximum displacement</span>
parameters that can be set separately for X and Y (for example, <span class="ui">Maximum displacement in X</span> set to 0 will jitter nodes only
vertically). Also, you can enable jittering separately for nodes themselves and for
their Bézier handles, as <a href="#fig13-57">Figure 13-57</a> demonstrates.</p>
			<a id="fig13-57"/><figure>

						Figure 13-57: The <span class="ui">Jitter Nodes</span> extension</p>

			</figure>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Distribution of the displacements</span> parameter
governs the probabilities of different displacement values, as <a href="#fig13-58">Figure 13-58</a> demonstrates. By switching from the
default <span class="ui">Uniform</span> to <span class="ui">Pareto</span>, you can make smaller
displacements a lot more probable than larger ones (much like in life, the probability of a random city
having a huge population is very small). <span class="ui">Gaussian</span> distribution has a more blunted peak, with the probabilities
falling off slowly around the peak but faster as you move further off. The <span class="ui">Log-normal</span> distribution
looks like Pareto, but its extreme values are more extreme and may fall far outside the <span class="ui">Maximum displacement</span> range.</p>

			<h4>
				13.4.2.4 <a id="290"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_290" title="290"/>Fractalize</h4>
			<p>
				This is another way to randomize a path. It flattens any Bézier
curves in the original path, then creates
new nodes between the existing ones and moves these new nodes around, leaving the original nodes in place. The<span class="ui">Subdivisions</span> parameter determines how many times each segment will be
subdivided in two (for example, 10 subdivisions turn a two-node path into one with
1,025 nodes because 2<sup>10</sup> + 1 = 1025). <span class="ui">Smoothness</span> changes how far the new nodes can move;
a lower <span class="ui">Smoothness</span> produces a rougher path. This effect is perfect for creating coastal lines in fantasy maps (<a href="#fig13-59">Figure 13-59</a>).</p>

			<h4>13.4.2.5 Mesh</h4>
			<p>
				The two extensions in this sub-submenu convert a mesh gradient (<a href="c10.xhtml#section10.7">10.7</a>) to a path and back, which might be a lifesaver given that Inkscape's tools for editing mesh nodes are currently rather poor (<a href="c10.xhtml#section10.7.3">10.7.3</a>).</p>
				<a id="section13.4.2.6"/>
				<h4>13.4.2.6 Pixel Snap</h4>
			<p>
				Use this extension to snap all nodes in all selected paths to px grid boundaries, so as to minimize anti-aliasing when exporting your artwork at 96 dpi (<a href="c18.xhtml#section18.6.1.2">18.6.1.2</a>).</p>
				<a id="section13.4.2.7"/>
				<h4>13.4.2.7 Rubber Stretch and Whirl</h4>
			<p>
				These extensions distort selected paths as <a href="#fig13-60">Figure 13-60</a> shows. They work best on paths with
many nodes because they only displace existing nodes without creating new ones. The <span class="ui">Whirl</span> extension works around the center
of the view in Inkscape when you start the extension; to place the center of
the view at the geometric center of the selection, press 3 or choose <span class="ui"><strong>View<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Zoom<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Selection</strong></span> (<a href="c03.xhtml#section3.11">3.11</a>).</p>

				<h4>13.4.3.1 Number Nodes</h4>
			<p>This replaces a path with a group of dots, each marking a node of
the original path with a sequential number (a text object). You can adjust the dots' size and the
font size of these numbers.</p>
			<a id="section13.4.3.2"/><h4>13.4.3.2 Draw Handles</h4>
			<p>
				This extension visualizes the Bézier handles of the selected paths, similar to the <span class="ui">Show handles</span> path effect (<a href="#section13.3.14">13.3.14</a>).
For each selected path, it creates a new path with each handle being a subpath.</p>
			<a id="section13.4.3.3"/><h4>13.4.3.3 Dimensions and Measure Path</h4>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Dimensions</span> extension creates a frame and dimension lines around the selected object (not necessarily a path); use
the <span class="ui"><strong>Measure Path</strong></span> extension to add the actual length measurements to it. This is 
similar to what the <span class="ui">Measure</span> effect does (<a href="#section13.3.14">13.3.14</a>).</p>

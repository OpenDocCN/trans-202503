- en: The *Doppelganger* sailed out of Probability Bay and far away from Laurie’s
    troubles. She risked a peek over the side of the boat and caught a beautiful surprise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Winsome! Look at that!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the wake of the boat, glowing sparkles lit up the water. Blue and green curlicues
    danced behind them as the waves fanned out.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Oh, yeah. Those are called gliders. Pretty, aren’t they?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “They’re beautiful! What makes them glow?” Laurie asked.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “When you stir up the water, they glow and form patterns. You can only see them
    on a dark night like this.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Wow! I’ve never seen anything like this!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Want to see something *really* cool?” Winsome dipped a shallow pan into the
    water and set it on a bench. After it settled down, she traced a little figure
    in the water.

- en: The glowing dots came alive and wiggled around the pan a few times before fading
    away.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “How do they move like that?” Laurie asked. “Are they really alive?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I don’t think so. It’s just a pattern that looks alive. There are supposed
    to be some rules about how the glow moves around, but I never paid attention.
    Maybe you can figure it out.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Winsome went back to minding the ship’s wheel. Laurie played with making more
    gliders, pretty waves, and curls. Xor tried to bite the glowing squiggles as they
    wriggled by, but all he caught was a mouthful of water.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Laurie got good at finding patterns that skittered through the water for longer
    and longer, but eventually, she grew restless.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Winsome, where are we going?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “We’re headed for Abstract Island,” Winsome replied. “I have some deliveries
    to make. We should get there by morning.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Abstract Island? That isn’t on my map,” Laurie said.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I bet a lot of things aren’t on your map, girl.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “You mean the map is not the territory?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Eh? Who told you that?” Winsome asked.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Colonel Trapp. He sent me a really strange letter.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Oh, *him*.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: “He’s a crazy old man,” Winsome said. “Always messing around in other people’s
    business. Sending those rude daemons with his stupid secret messages.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “The secret messages were fun. Xor figured out how to—”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Be careful with the Colonel, Laurie. I’m pretty sure he was the one trying
    to get you thrown in jail.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Who is he?” Laurie asked.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “He’s my—he was my boss,” said Winsome. “This was his mail boat. Until I copied
    it. We . . . disagree about how to do business, so I struck out on my own.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “You had a fight with him?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Well, yes,” Winsome said.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “What did you fight about?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “He wants things to stay just the way they are. I . . . don’t.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Oh,” said Laurie. Something about Winsome’s voice told Laurie not to ask her
    more about the fight. They were quiet for a time, watching the sky and water.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “The Colonel’s right about one thing,” Winsome said softly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “What’s that?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “A map is just a picture. It’s not the real thing. If someone forgets to put
    Abstract Island on a map, the Island still exists. It doesn’t care what you know.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “No one in Userland said anything about islands,” Laurie said.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “The people back there don’t know much about the world outside. That’s the way
    the Colonel likes it. Userland is an island. It’s a whole world of islands.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Laurie didn’t like what she was hearing. “But Winsome, I have to follow my map
    to get back home.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Do you?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Yes!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Why?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “That’s what everyone told me to do,” Laurie said.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “That’s not a good enough reason,” Winsome said.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “It isn’t?” People told Laurie what to do all the time. She didn’t always do
    what they said, of course, but she usually felt bad about it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “No! You should always know *why* you are doing something,” said Winsome, “and
    not just because someone told you to do it. Keep your head on and be flexible,
    girl. Otherwise, you’re like those little gliders, going wherever people send
    you.”

- en: “But Tinker said—”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Forget Tinker for a minute,” Winsome said. “How did you get lost in the first
    place?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I had a fight with my mom,” Laurie said. “Mom wants me to go to school over
    the summer, but I don’t even need to!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Maybe summer school is a good thing. I heard that kids in other countries—”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I don’t care! I don’t want to waste the whole summer in school with people
    I don’t even know!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Okay, that’s fair. So then what happened?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I took a walk in the woods to calm down a little, but I was so mad that I forgot
    to watch where I was going, and I got lost, and I spent a long time walking in
    circles,” said Laurie, her eyes filling with tears. “Then I was attacked by those
    Jargon things, and I ran and ran until I came here, but then I made a Jargon myself
    because I didn’t know the rules, and no one here has even heard of Hamilton, or
    dollars, or anything! And I don’t understand why I need a password, and now I’m
    going to an island that’s not even on the map and—”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Hey, slow down—” Winsome said.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “—now I’m lost all over again and . . . and . . .” Laurie started sobbing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Wait, don’t, oh man . . .”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Winsome knew how to handle the nastiest people you’d never want to meet, but
    a crying girl was something else. She gave Laurie an awkward hug until the noise
    stopped.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “You done?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Yeah.” Laurie sniffled.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Good. I thought you were going to sink the boat,” said Winsome. “Why don’t
    you go below and get some rest? And think about something before you fall asleep.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Think about what?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Making your own map.”

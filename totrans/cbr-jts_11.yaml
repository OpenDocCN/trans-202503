- en: In ancient Japan, locks were simpler than the locking devices of today, as the
    manufacturing capabilities of the time could not produce the intricate pins, tumblers,
    and other components that contemporary locks use. However, these older locks were
    elegantly designed, making exemplary use of “prongs, latches, and the natural
    forces of gravity and tension” to keep people’s valuables safe from intruders
    and thieves.^([2](b01.xhtml#endnote-78))

    ways to open all of them. The scrolls indicate that no lock, barrier, or other
    mechanism was safe from a shinobi with well-constructed tools, sufficient training
    and ingenuity, and an optimistic mindset. Significant portions of all three scrolls
    are dedicated to documenting how to make and use various picks, shims, and other
    probing tools used to open locks, doors, and gates ([Figure 11-1](#figure11-1)).^([3](b01.xhtml#endnote-79))

    Knowing that locks could not be fully trusted, shinobi themselves developed techniques
    to take security into their own hands. Some were bluntly simple: when sleeping
    in lodgings secured by locks they did not trust, shinobi sometimes tied a string
    from the door or window to the topknot in their hair, ensuring they would wake
    up if the door latch or lock were opened as they slept.^([5](b01.xhtml#endnote-81))'

    threat actors still use picks to defeat them. The lock, as it always has, serves
    multiple purposes: it works as a deterrent. It is a visible assurance to an owner
    that their property is safe. It creates a system of accountability to the key
    holder(s) if the lock is breached through use of a key. It also serves as a barrier
    and an alarm, since thieves will take time and make noise as they attempt to bypass
    it. In this chapter, we will discuss how hackers, much like shinobi, are still
    picking locks and bypassing security. Furthermore, we’ll talk about why physical
    locks are so important to digital systems and detail the necessary companion precautions.
    We will also explore some technological advances in locks and picks, discovering
    what else the shinobi can teach us about security.'

    is a common entry point into cybersecurity. The act of finding flaws in or physically
    accessing a thing that is supposed to be secure—the visual, tactile, and audible
    feedback of a lock’s opening in your hand after you’ve beaten its defenses—can
    be a powerful sensation. It can pique interest in the security field and build
    confidence in fledgling abilities.

- en: The cybersecurity industry uses locking devices to restrict physical access
    to buildings, data centers, switching closets, and individual offices.^([6](b01.xhtml#endnote-82))
    On a more granular level, rack locks limit access to servers, chassis-case locks
    limit access to a system’s physical components, device port locks prevent unauthorized
    use of USBs or console jacks, tethering locks prevent systems from leaving their
    location, and power locks keep devices from turning on at all. Locking down physical
    access to systems is a crucial piece of an organization’s cybersecurity strategy.
    If systems are vulnerable to being tampered with physically, many digital security
    controls are at risk of being rendered ineffective once the adversary gains physical
    access. It should be assumed that, if adversaries gain physical access to a machine,
    they also gain admin-level privileges on the system and acquire its data.

- en: Despite the proliferation of illicit lockpicking tools and techniques, organizations
    tend to use the same locks year after year, leaving themselves extremely vulnerable
    to attack. Most information system and building access locks use weak pin tumblers,
    such as the Yale cylindrical lock—patented in the 1860s and now the world’s most
    common lock due to its low cost and ease of mass production—and tubular locks
    (or “circle locks”), the most common type of bicycle lock. Criminals construct,
    sell, and use picking tools that can easily beat these off-the-shelf locks. For
    example, soda can shims can pry open locks, pen caps can simulate tubular keys,
    and 3D-printed plastic keys can be easily forged from pictures of the original.
    For the unskilled criminal, autoelectronic lockpickers can, with the pull of a
    trigger, do all the work of picking every tumbler lock’s pin within seconds.

    more concerned with liability than security. For example, certain insurance policies
    won’t cover break-ins and thefts if inferior locks—such as the most common ones
    sold in the United States—were picked or bypassed during the crime. Some governments
    issue compliance standards for lock manufacturers, along with restrictions that
    bar selling substandard locks to citizens. In the cybersecurity realm, select
    governments safeguard their classified systems and data with a combination of
    cipher locks or other high-assurance locks and supplemental security controls
    that mitigate the lock’s security flaws.

    that complement each other. The first stage could be a digital 4-digit PIN lock
    that would temporarily unfreeze the pins in the second-stage lock, a cylinder
    lock. While the pins are frozen in the second-stage lock, they are impossible
    to pick, but a key could be inserted in preparation for activation by the first-stage
    lock. Once the pins are temporarily unfrozen, the physical key can be turned,
    and the entryway can be unlocked. However, this window of opportunity opens for
    only three seconds. After that, the digital lock resets and refreezes the pins.
    To be successful, the intruder would need to first learn the PIN and then be able
    to pick the door lock in under three seconds, a feat that may not be humanly possible.

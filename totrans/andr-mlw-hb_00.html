<p class="noindentsa">Android is the world’s most popular operating system, touching the lives of nearly half its population. But its scale and capabilities regularly attract criminals, fraudsters, and scammers looking to steal money from users or otherwise illicitly profit.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This book’s authors have been working in the field of Android security since 2011, shortly after the first malware sample was found on the platform. Three of us—Sebastian, Salvador, and Sai—developed defenses against Android malware as part of Google’s Android Security team. Separately, V.S. and his researchers, including Qian and Yanhai, created some of the first robust machine learning methods for characterizing the behavior of Android malware.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Over the years, we’ve seen Android users wrestle with ransomware, phishing, fraud, and many other kinds of harmful applications. We’ve also seen malware developers become more sophisticated, producing interesting families of malicious apps that have been documented by security researchers all over the world.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">After observing and combating these digital threats for more than a decade, we decided it was time to record what we knew about the Android malware we’d seen in the past, the methods of analyzing the malware of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxv"/>present, and the use of machine learning to detect malware that may appear in the future. To date, this book is the most comprehensive overview of Android malware trends. Its aim is to help readers develop the analysis and detection skills that are so vital in today’s cybersecurity landscape.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As you begin to study the vast array of malware categories in the Android ecosystem, you’ll soon realize how dynamic they are and how complex malware detection can be. Most security books don’t touch on machine learning techniques, but over the last few years machine learning algorithms have proven effective at accelerating the identification and classification of malware apps, allowing defenders to respond more quickly to that complexity and at a larger scale. Developing expertise in this type of AI-powered automation is a natural next step in the evolution of a malware analyst’s skill set.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch0lev1">Who Should Read This Book</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This book is for three kinds of readers. First, it is for those who seek to understand what mobile malware looks like and how to inspect it. Second, it is for more experienced Android malware analysts looking for a thorough picture of the Android malware ecosystem. We cover numerous real Android malware specimens, including noteworthy malware families that have never before been publicly discussed.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Third, this book is for security professionals interested in familiarizing themselves with the use of machine learning to detect malware. By considering the objectives and functionality of different malware categories, you’ll learn how to leverage machine learning algorithms to detect new malware at scale.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch0lev2">What You’ll Find in This Book</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This book provides an introduction to the analysis and detection of Android malware samples using manual and machine learning approaches. We start with a tour of the Android malware ecosystem, then cover the manual analysis of malicious apps. Lastly, we consider techniques for automatically detecting malware using machine learning. Although we recommend reading the chapters in order, you should feel free to skip to any part that you’d like.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In <a href="part1.xhtml">Part I</a>, we begin with an introduction to the Android security model and the malware that targets the platform. We highlight interesting structural characteristics of numerous malware families, focusing on how they abused operating system features or how their malicious functionality was revealed. The chapters in this section are as follows:</p>&#13;
<div class="bq">&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><strong><a href="ch01.xhtml">Chapter 1: The Basics of Android Security</a></strong> Introduces the Android operating system’s security model and the malware categories that Google’s Android Security team uses to organize and track its work.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><strong><a href="ch02.xhtml">Chapter 2: Android Malware in the Wild</a></strong> Describes the most popular and interesting Android malware families we’ve observed since 2008. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxvi"/>This chapter also introduces readers to historical trends that help in understanding today’s Android malware landscape.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Next, in <a href="part2.xhtml">Part II</a>, we walk through the manual analysis of two real recent Android malware apps, diving deep into reverse engineering techniques and common malware behavior. These chapters include:</p>&#13;
<div class="bq">&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><strong><a href="ch03.xhtml">Chapter 3: Static Analysis</a></strong> Introduces the reader to the analysis of Android app files by walking through the code belonging to a real specimen of toll fraud malware. We explain how to use common open source tools to dissect an app and share best practices for understanding its components, structure, and code.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><strong><a href="ch04.xhtml">Chapter 4: Dynamic Analysis</a></strong> Covers the analysis of currently executing Android apps by analyzing a real specimen of phishing malware. We also explain how to use open source tools to get a comprehensive picture of the behavior of Android malware at runtime.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Finally, in <a href="part3.xhtml">Part III</a>, we explore the automation of Android malware detection using machine learning. You’ll be introduced to popular machine learning algorithms and learn how to interpret their output when they’re applied to Android malware. Here is an outline of the chapters in this section:</p>&#13;
<div class="bq">&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><strong><a href="ch05.xhtml">Chapter 5: Machine Learning Fundamentals</a></strong> Explains the approach used to apply machine learning to Android malware analysis and detection and introduces key machine learning concepts, including classifiers, features, and model training.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><strong><a href="ch06.xhtml">Chapter 6: Machine Learning Features</a></strong> Discusses the identification of machine learning features using the results of static analysis and dynamic analysis, then covers the creation of advanced features that are more likely to identify malware that attempts to evade detection. This chapter also shows the reader different ways to measure whether an app should be considered malware or goodware, depending on the output of the machine learning model.</p>&#13;

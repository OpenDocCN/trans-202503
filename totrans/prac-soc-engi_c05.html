<p class="ChapterIntro">In the previous chapter, we discussed using sophisticated tools for OSINT collection. However, you don’t always need fancy tools to get the information you need. Often, looking at social media platforms is enough. In this chapter, we’ll discuss how some of the most innocent posts on the internet can be weaponized. You’ll learn how to gather OSINT from these platforms, as well as a few platforms that aren’t social media, but are just as impactful. You’ll read a company’s public documents and learn to take automatic screenshots to document your findings. </p>
<h2 id="h1-500983c05-0001">Analyzing Social Media for OSINT</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Social media platforms give us insight into the lives of the people and businesses we target. While some organizations have <em>clean desk policies</em> that require employees to remove sensitive information from their desks when they’re on break, at lunch, or out of the office, many of those policies do not include photos taken on personal devices. As a result, people post publicly <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_54" title="54"/>about whatever concerns or excites them, whether it be at home or at work. This gives OSINT investigators an all-access tour of an organization’s facilities, and often lets us see more than we would in an in-person tour. </p>
<p>In <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 6">Chapter 6</span>, we’ll revisit social media sites as a means of learning about the person making the post.</p>
<h3 id="h2-500983c05-0001">LinkedIn</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst"><em>LinkedIn</em> is an excellent professional social network. Many of its users are a little too open about their experience, giving away all the technologies and processes used internally. By looking up the company’s employees on the site, we can populate a target list for phishing, find the technologies used at the company, and enumerate roles we could inhabit in vishing attacks. LinkedIn is an OSINT gold mine, especially for smaller companies with smaller online footprints. </p>
<aside epub:type="sidebar">

<section class="note">
<h2><span class="NoteHead">Note</span></h2>
<p>	Some of the analysis features discussed here are available only to users of LinkedIn Premium, which at the time of this writing costs $29 per month. Keep in mind that features (for any product or service) will change for better and worse. My focus in these sections is less about the tools and features and more about the techniques.</p>
<div class="bottom hr"><hr/></div>

</aside>
<h4 id="h3-500983c05-0001">General Company Information</h4>
<p class="BodyFirst">Let’s take a look at Walmart’s LinkedIn business page (<a href="#figure5-1" id="figureanchor5-1">Figure 5-1</a>). On the top of the page, we can see how many followers Walmart has, how many of this account’s connections work at Walmart, a stock ticker, and an overview of the company. The About Us section also provides us with general information about Walmart. </p>
<figure>
<img alt="&lt;&lt;LinkedIn web page shows “About” tab for Walmart, showing contact info, stock ticker, and a short summary of Walmart’s founding and mission.&gt;&gt;" class="keyline" src="image_fi/500983c05/f05001.png"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure5-1">Figure 5-1</a>: Company details for Walmart on LinkedIn </p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_55" title="55"/>Further down, the page lists the website and addresses of all major Walmart sites, information about when and where the company was founded, the location of the headquarters, the company size, and its specialties. </p>
<h4 id="h3-500983c05-0002">Job Information</h4>
<p class="BodyFirst">Since people often use LinkedIn as a job board, the company pages list information pertinent to job seekers, such as the known employee count and whether it is increasing or decreasing (<a href="#figure5-2" id="figureanchor5-2">Figure 5-2</a>). </p>
<figure>
<img alt="&lt;&lt;LinkedIn web page shows Insights tab available to Premium users. Above, a pie chart with Walmart's employee distribution and headcount growth separated by function (Sales, Support, Operations, and Healthcare Services). Below, bar graph shows number of new hires by month.&gt;&gt;" class="keyline" src="image_fi/500983c05/f05002.png"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure5-2">Figure 5-2</a>: Employee details for Walmart on LinkedIn</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The average tenure of an employee can help us interact with targets when phishing and vishing. We can estimate how likely it is that one employee will know an employee at another site, especially at large companies with more than 300,000 employees, like Walmart. Similarly, LinkedIn’s data about the distribution of employees, growth, and new hires can give us insight about the likelihood of our coming across a new hire if we, say, called the offices. </p>
<h4 id="h3-500983c05-0003">Employees of the Company</h4>
<p class="BodyFirst">A separate page lists LinkedIn users who are employees of the company. Use this to see the role each person plays. For example, <a href="#figure5-3" id="figureanchor5-3">Figure 5-3</a> shows someone with the job title <em>intrusion analyst</em>, a cybersecurity role that suggests the company actively monitors its websites and networks for malicious behavior. </p>
<p>We can assess the security of the company via its number of information security employees. An easy way to accomplish this is to look through employee profiles for certification acronyms. Checking for CISSP, GPEN, OSCP, CEH, and Security+ are good starting points. Good job titles to search for include the terms <em>information security, cybersecurity, intrusion, </em>and<em> CISO</em>.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_56" title="56"/><figure>
<img alt="&lt;&lt;LinkedIn web page shows search results for 6 Walmart employees listed as intrusion analysts (names and profile pictures censored by author).&gt;&gt;" class="keyline" src="image_fi/500983c05/f05003.png"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure5-3">Figure 5-3</a>: Employees of Walmart on LinkedIn</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These employee profiles also tell us about the technologies that the company uses. By searching them, we can detect the presence of security event and incident management (SEIM) solutions, malware protections, email filtering, or VPNs. Additionally, they help us build an email list for further profiling and phishing.</p>
<h3 id="h2-500983c05-0002">Job Boards and Career Sites</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Employees, recruiters, and outsourced recruiting vendors might link to career pages or job boards on their social media. As a byproduct, clever social engineers, red teamers, and OSINT investigators can scrape that information and weaponize it. </p>
<p>Depending on how the job posting is written, you might find the keys to the kingdom in a single sentence. In <a href="#figure5-4" id="figureanchor5-4">Figure 5-4</a>, you can see that the candidate must have Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) version 12.2.7 experience. This tells a would-be attacker to look for that specific software version. The way that this career posting is written could lead an attacker to believe they are also continuing to use version 11.5.10.2, which has vulnerabilities dating back to 2006. </p>
<p>This could go a few ways. First, we can search for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) entries pertaining to this particular software, and then check sites like <a class="LinkURL" href="https://www.exploit-db.com/">https://www.exploit-db.com/</a> for known exploit code. Alternatively, we could use this information in our pretexts in phishing or vishing. Finally, we could just attempt to brute-force on any public-facing instances of the software in question, which would be the noisiest and outside the scope of social engineering or OSINT. </p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_57" title="57"/><figure>
<img alt="&lt;&lt;Generic job board web page shows job posting with bullet points listing Essential Responsibilities. Mentions of Oracle software outlined in red.&gt;&gt;" class="keyline" src="image_fi/500983c05/f05004.png"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure5-4">Figure 5-4</a>: A job posting that is too verbose</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Other notable things to look for in job postings are mentions of which manager the role reports to. Knowing the organizational chart and who fills which role can be useful in building pretexts in situations where name dropping would help your credibility. Do not limit this to current postings, either. Look at the older postings on sites like Indeed, Ladders, and LinkedIn. You can also check <a class="LinkURL" href="https://archive.org/">https://archive.org/</a> for older pages. By reviewing older posts, you can get a feel for how often the organization patches or upgrades its software, as well as the culture in HR and Security.</p>
<h3 id="h2-500983c05-0003">Facebook</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Facebook</em> can be a gold mine or a cesspool, depending on who you ask and what you are looking for. That’s because the data is plentiful but minimally vetted, although fact-checked at times. Many people tend to over-share on this site (behavior we’ll explore further in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 6">Chapter 6</span>). In this section, we’ll stick to business-related information about a company and its customers. </p>
<p>To start analyzing on Facebook, create an account that you don’t use for personal reasons. Even though creating a fake account violates the site’s Terms of Service, doing so will keep you from showing up in the People That You May Know tab under your real profile. You’ll also be able to post to your page publicly without confusing your legitimate friends and risk having them out you. Keep in mind that, in the wake of the controversies surrounding Russia’s involvement in the 2016 US presidential election and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_58" title="58"/>other cases involving data practices and disinformation, Facebook is cracking down on fake accounts and those using images generated by artificial intelligence. </p>
<p>As another layer of security, avoid using the site’s mobile apps, because they typically have access to all applications on your mobile device and can pinpoint an account as belonging to you without any other inputs. You may also get increasingly personal advertisements, which I personally find to be alarming.</p>
<p>Now, what can we find from Facebook? Competitors, customers, promotions, press releases, news, and general public sentiment.</p>
<h4 id="h3-500983c05-0004">Company Information </h4>
<p class="BodyFirst">On an organization’s Facebook page (see <a href="#figure5-5" id="figureanchor5-5">Figure 5-5</a> for Walmart’s), look for contact information, any relevant timelines, or press releases. For smaller companies, it’s common to find news about awards won or lists to which they were added. You may also see posts about employee activities and accomplishments, especially if you’re targeting a consultancy. </p>
<figure>
<img alt="&lt;&lt;Facebook profile page for Walmart displays the Home section showing featured Spotlight, “The Art of Doing Valentine’s Day.”&gt;&gt;" class="keyline" src="image_fi/500983c05/f05006.png"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure5-5">Figure 5-5</a>: Walmart’s landing page on Facebook</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Look at the page’s About section (<a href="#figure5-6" id="figureanchor5-6">Figure 5-6</a>). This is where we might find phone numbers, even if they’re for a help desk, customer support, or company hotline. We may find email addresses and will almost certainly see their website. </p>
<p>Companies may also share a timeline of events—such as founding dates, relocations, mergers and acquisitions, and the retirements of key employees—that can provide us with information to use in our pretexts or engagements.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_59" title="59"/><figure>
<img alt="&lt;&lt;Facebook profile page for Walmart displays the About section under “More,” including number of likes, follows, and check-ins, plus company contact information (shows website, phone number, and indicates high level of responsiveness to Facebook messages).&gt;&gt;" class="keyline" src="image_fi/500983c05/f05005.png"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure5-6">Figure 5-6</a>: Walmart’s About Us page on Facebook</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="h3-500983c05-0005">Customers and Public Sentiment</h4>
<p class="BodyFirst">When vishing a company, one of the slyest ways to get an employee to actually talk to you is to pose as a customer. You can find a myriad of real customers by looking at Facebook’s Community tab and reading reviews. In <a href="#figure5-7" id="figureanchor5-7">Figure 5-7</a>, Walmart’s Community tab shows various posts to the page by the general public. These should be taken with a grain of salt and in context. Some of these posts are legitimate concerns, but others are conspiracy theories, unfounded claims, attempts at going viral, and reports of fake or impersonating pages. </p>
<figure>
<img alt="&lt;&lt;Facebook profile page for Walmart displays more of the Home section including 34 million Total Likes and nearly 33 million Total Follows outlined in red, Top Fans, Visitor Photos, and Public Posts from users (personal information censored by author).&gt;&gt;" class="keyline" src="image_fi/500983c05/f05007.png"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure5-7">Figure 5-7</a>: Walmart’s Community page on Facebook </p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_60" title="60"/>The Community tab shows us the company’s follower count. This metric indicates the strength of the brand and how strongly the company engages in customer interaction and acquisition. </p>
<p>Take a look at the kinds of posts customers share on the company wall and how often people post. Does the company respond to these posts? Does the company show empathy, or is the company cold? This can help us develop our dossier for the company, as well as the dossier that we use as a pretext. Sometimes people will share random posts to the company’s wall in an attempt to go viral. Take this into account and adjust for it when analyzing. </p>
<h3 id="h2-500983c05-0004">Instagram</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Instagram</em> is a treasure trove of OSINT. In a Social Engineering Capture the Flag (SECTF) competition I once participated in, I found over 90 percent of the information against my target company by using Instagram. </p>
<h4 id="h3-500983c05-0006">Followers and Hashtags</h4>
<p class="BodyFirst">More interesting than who follows the business account is whom the business account follows. Company accounts typically follow executives and relevant influencers, as well as marketing and public relations staff. For example, take a look at whom Walmart follows (<a href="#figure5-8" id="figureanchor5-8">Figure 5-8</a>). The list includes the brands they sell and LeBron James.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="&lt;&lt;Instagram page displays Walmart's “Following” tab, showing six other Instagram accounts followed by Walmart, including Allswell Home, Art.com, Hot Wheels, Chance the Rapper, LeBron James, and MoDRN Living.&gt;&gt;" class="keyline" src="image_fi/500983c05/f05008.png"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure5-8">Figure 5-8</a>: List of accounts that Walmart’s Instagram page is following</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Also search for hashtags that the target follows. This tells us about what the target considers important. The hashtags could be relevant to a promotion that the company is running, for instance, or indicate whether its social media team is sloppy. Hashtags could also be about the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_61" title="61"/>company’s competitors. From the hashtags that Walmart chooses to follow (<a href="#figure5-9" id="figureanchor5-9">Figure 5-9</a>), we learn about internal initiatives, customer incentives, and potentially lingo used internally.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="&lt;&lt;Instagram page displays Walmart's “Following” tab, showing five hashtags followed by Walmart (#walmartassociateartchallenge, #hereforeverybeauty, #walmartemojihunt, #thewalmartbox, and #walmartfinds).&gt;&gt;" class="keyline" src="image_fi/500983c05/f05009.png"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure5-9">Figure 5-9</a>: Hashtags that Walmart follows on Instagram</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="h3-500983c05-0007">Finding Geotagged Posts</h4>
<p class="BodyFirst">Next, leave the company’s Instagram page and search Instagram for the company’s office address. This leads us to all posts <em>geotagged</em> at this address. Geotagging occurs automatically when both a device and an app’s location services are enabled. The location will be embedded into the post and become a searchable field. From the returned pictures, you’ll likely find two very useful bits of information: company badges and pictures from the employees’ desks. </p>
<p>Pictures of badges can help us identify the badge manufacturer and design. In some cases, you may be able to clone key-card badges to gain access to the facilities. Brent White and Tim Roberts provide a good cheat sheet for using the Proxmark badge cloner (and so much more) at <a class="LinkURL" href="https://wehackpeople.wordpress.com/2018/07/16/proxmark-3-cheat-sheet-and-rfid-thief-instructions/">https://wehackpeople.wordpress.com/2018/07/16/proxmark-3-cheat-sheet-and-rfid-thief-instructions/</a><em> </em>. In other cases, you might be able to replicate the badge’s design. For example, the Walmart supplier badge in <a href="#figure5-10" id="figureanchor5-10">Figure 5-10</a> shows us what the supplier badges look like, including the fonts they use and that they have a barcode and expiration date. </p>
<p>We may be able to re-create the badge’s barcode. Though the badge does not contain any numbers useful for identification, it does include a date—potentially helpful in a clever ruse to gain access.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_62" title="62"/><figure>
<img alt="&lt;&lt;Instagram page displays a post from a Walmart sweet tea supplier geotagged at the Walmart corporate office. Image shows a Walmart Supplier badge with full name and company name listed. Caption reads &quot;Fingers crossed! Now, go get 'em!&quot; with hashtags #walmart, #neighborhoodmarket, and #crossyourfingers.&gt;&gt;" class="keyline" src="image_fi/500983c05/f05010.png"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure5-10">Figure 5-10</a>: A Walmart supplier badge found on Instagram</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Alternatively, you can make nonfunctional fake badges. You may also learn how people dress at the site, allowing you to blend in. For example, at Walmart stores, associates typically wear khaki pants and a dark blue shirt with a smock and a badge. <a href="#figure5-11" id="figureanchor5-11">Figure 5-11</a> shows an array of Walmart badge pictures, all of which seem innocent enough until a social engineer or malicious actor leverages them to gain unauthorized access to the facility. </p>
<figure>
<img alt="&lt;&lt;Instagram page displays six images of employees, some with Walmart badges clearly displayed, geotagged at the Bentonville, Arkansas, Walmart Corporate Headquarters (personal badge information censored by author).&gt;&gt;" class="keyline" src="image_fi/500983c05/f05011.png"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure5-11">Figure 5-11</a>: Numerous badges of Walmart employees found on Instagram</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_63" title="63"/>Pictures of desks can tell us more about technologies a company uses. <a href="#figure5-12" id="figureanchor5-12">Figure 5-12</a> shows a picture of an employee cubicle. The employee (associate) was bragging about a card they received, but the shot also shows that they are using a MacBook with Photoshop, Microsoft Office 2016, and Cisco WebEx opened on the dock of macOS.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="&lt;&lt;Instagram post geotagged at the Bentonville, Arkansas, Walmart Corporate Headquarters shows employee desk with pink card on laptop keyboard reading “with appreciation for all you do! – your secret admirer.” Employee laptop shows MacOS dock programs. Image caption reads &quot;7 hours later and I’m still looking for my ‘Secret Admirer’” with unicorn emojis.&gt;&gt;" class="" src="image_fi/500983c05/f05012.png"/>

<h2 id="h1-500983c05-0002">Leveraging Shodan for OSINT</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">John Matherly developed Shodan (<a class="LinkURL" href="https://www.shodan.io/">https://www.shodan.io/</a>) in 2009 as a search engine to index internet-connected devices. In practice, this means Shodan actively scans the internet for insecure and open devices, and then enters these devices in its searchable and indexed database for user consumption. Let’s look at the primary methods of analysis using Shodan. </p>
<p>A Shodan membership price varies based on access level, from free to $899 per month. The levels are defined by the number of assets you wish to continuously monitor, the number of searches you want to do, and whether to search for explicit vulnerabilities. Shodan often runs Black Friday specials granting cheap lifetime access.</p>
<h3 id="h2-500983c05-0005">Using Shodan Search Parameters</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Search Shodan by using one of the following search parameters:</p>
<ol class="none">
<li><span class="RunInHead">city</span>  For defining the city to search in.</li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">country</span>  For defining the country to search in.</li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">geo</span>  For searching within a certain latitude and longitude.</li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_64" title="64"/><span class="RunInHead">hostname</span>  For finding a specific hostname.</li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">net</span>  For searching a defined IP address, range, or CIDR.</li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">os</span>  For finding a specific operating system.</li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">port</span>  For finding specific open ports.</li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">before/after</span>  For defining a time frame in which to search. Since organizations change their hardware and software architecture, and Shodan is always scanning, entries will change. Setting a time frame can help you find patterns of updates, as well as currently implemented and relevant technologies. For example, if you know an organization uses Cisco ASA, you can look at software release dates and cross-compare that to when the version change appears in Shodan to get an idea of its patching tempo.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="h2-500983c05-0006">Searching IP Addresses </h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">If you know an IP address or range, you can query it in Shodan to resolve the host, services, and service banners (<a href="#figure5-13" id="figureanchor5-13">Figure 5-13</a>). This will help if you’re conducting this OSINT to prepare for a penetration test. </p>
<figure>
<img alt="&lt;&lt;Shodan web page displays results for Walmart IP address. Top banner shows geolocation data. Below shows the country, organization, ISP, hostnames, ASN, web technologies, ports, and services associated with the IP address.&gt;&gt;" class="keyline" src="image_fi/500983c05/f05013.png"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure5-13">Figure 5-13</a>: Shodan enumeration of IP address and running ports and services with banners</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Shodan also tells us about the TLS/SSL certificate used for encrypting the web traffic to and from the site. If the certificate employs weak ciphers, you might count this as an attack vector for technical exploitation.</p>
<h3 id="h2-500983c05-0007"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_65" title="65"/>Searching Domain Names </h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">If you enter your target organization’s domain name in Shodan, the system will respond with all known hosts. This will help you get information about ports and protocols in use, as well as service banners and service versions. This method also helps us identify the types of internet-connected systems they use (such as NGINX, Apache, and IIS), in addition to hostnames and IP addresses. </p>
<p><a href="#figure5-14" id="figureanchor5-14">Figure 5-14</a> shows the result of a search for the <em>walmart.com</em> domain with the qualifier that the hosts must belong to Walmart stores. This prevents pulling up irrelevant domains that contain the phrase <em>walmart.com</em> or sites with links to <em>walmart.com</em>.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="&lt;&lt;Shodan web page displays results for &quot;org: ‘Wal-Mart -Stores.’&quot; Left shows 1978 results, with Top Countries, Services, Organizations, Operating Systems, and Products. Right shows 4 IP addresses for domains with Walmart store hosts.&gt;&gt;" class="keyline" src="image_fi/500983c05/f05014.png"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure5-14">Figure 5-14</a>: Shodan domain and IP address enumeration filtered by <em>Wal</em><em>-M</em><em>art</em><em> Stores</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="h2-500983c05-0008">Searching Hostnames and Subdomains </h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">If we know a specific hostname or subdomain, we can search for it in Shodan, the same way we searched domains. Shodan will provide us with more focused information, such as an IP address, service, and open ports on the host. The specific information returned will vary based on the domain, and its usefulness depends on what we plan to do with the information. For example, <a href="#figure5-15" id="figureanchor5-15">Figure 5-15</a> shows Microsoft IIS web servers that belong to Walmart.</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_66" title="66"/><figure>
<img alt="&lt;&lt;Shodan web page displays results for &quot;org:'Wal-Mart -Stores' product:'Microsoft IIS httpd.” Shows 3 of 10 Microsoft IIS web servers, including sections for SSL Certificates and Supported SSL Versions.&gt;&gt;" class="keyline" src="image_fi/500983c05/f05015.png"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure5-15">Figure 5-15</a>: Further Shodan IP address enumeration</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We see the character set, HTTP code, and, if a known vulnerability exists, the CVE number, which can guide us to technical exploitation, if that is the endgame.</p>
<h2 id="h1-500983c05-0003">Taking Automatic Screenshots with Hunchly</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">So far in this chapter, we’ve discussed manually mining web pages for useful information. But when you’re not using a dedicated OSINT tool like Recon-ng, keeping track of all the information you find is not always easy. Hunchly (<a class="LinkURL" href="https://www.hunch.ly/">https://www.hunch.ly/</a>) is a Chrome (or Chromium browser like Brave) extension that provides you with screenshots of everything you look up. Created by Justin Seitz, Hunchly costs $129 per year at the time of this writing, but allows a 30-day free trial. If you conduct frequent OSINT investigations, paying for the license is well worth the price.</p>
<p>To use Hunchly, download and install the plug-in. Within the Hunchly dashboard, you can define an investigation by clicking the <b>+</b> icon and selecting <b>New Case</b> (<a href="#figure5-16" id="figureanchor5-16">Figure 5-16</a>). This will sort all the screenshots taken during the session and categorize them for the specific case. Think of it as a database.</p>
<p>Once you’ve added the case, ensure that you allow Hunchly to record your activity by selecting the blue icon in the top-right corner and enabling the extension. Also, ensure that you select the appropriate case to save the files under.</p>
<p>Once you’ve enabled Hunchly, simply navigate through whatever you are investigating in the Chrome browser. Once you’re finished, disable the Hunchly extension, and then click the dashboard button to see what you have collected (<a href="#figure5-17" id="figureanchor5-17">Figure 5-17</a>).</p>

<p>If you select a specific artifact, you can view the screenshot and any information about it, such as what you searched, the path of the URL corresponding to the search, the date on which you collected it, the date at which the site was updated, and a hash of the screenshot. This information <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_68" title="68"/>is vital if you are collecting OSINT for legal reasons and will be using the screenshot as evidence in court. </p>
<h2 id="h1-500983c05-0004">Pilfering SEC Forms</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Publicly traded companies in the United States must produce and submit a variety of documents and forms to maintain compliance. These documents prove to the SEC that all information being reported is truthful and that the company is not breaking any laws. Because these documents are available to the public, they’re a great source of OSINT. </p>
<p>To find a company’s SEC forms, browse to the SEC EDGAR website (<a class="LinkURL" href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html">https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html</a>). You can learn more about the various SEC forms at Investopedia, <a class="LinkURL" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/08/sec-forms.asp">https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/08/sec-forms.asp</a>.</p>
<p>One particularly useful form to look at is SEC Form 10-K, which is the company’s annual report. It provides an overview of how the company is doing financially, the executive team, the board of directors, any problems they had over the past year, and risks that concern them. The SEC mandates that companies file these forms within 90 days of the end of their fiscal year, so publication dates may vary.</p>
<p>Using Walmart’s 10-K and annual report from 2018, let’s examine points of interest for an OSINT assessment. For example, Walmart’s 2018 annual report says the following:</p>
<blockquote class="review">
<p class="Blockquote">We’re equipping and empowering our associates to be successful with better information, tools and training. In stores, this means our associates are spending more time driving sales and less time doing repetitive tasks. We’ve opened training academies to further develop the retail skills of our associates, and we’ve deployed new technology and apps to help them improve in-stock levels and better manage price changes.</p></blockquote>
<p>This lets us know two things: the company calls its employees <em>associates</em> and has opened training academies, information that can be used to build rapport. When writing an email for a phishing attack, you may even directly quote from such a report (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 7">Chapter 7</span> for an example of this tactic). </p>
<p>The 10-K form begins by stating when the fiscal year ends, which gives us insight as to when the most urgency will be, relative to the fiscal quarters. A little lower on the form, we see where the company is legally incorporated; its home office address, ZIP code, and main phone number; and its employer identification number (EIN). </p>
<p>In Walmart’s 2018 10-K form, you can find the following useful information:</p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>A statement about changing the business name from <em>Walmart Stores, Inc.</em> to <em>Walmart Inc.</em> </b></p>
<ol class="none">
<li>This could be useful in engaging with employees and vendors alike. </li>
</ol>
<p class="ListHead"><b><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_69" title="69"/>A section called “Risks Factors and Uncertainties Affecting Our Business”</b></p>
<ol class="none">
<li>This is an excellent reference that will help an attacker understand the company’s business model and how it perceives threats. </li>
</ol>
<p class="ListHead"><b>A list of websites that Walmart uses to conduct business on the internet</b></p>
<ol class="none">
<li>Here, we also see what Walmart considers to be its competition. In the section about its warehouse membership Sam’s Club, for instance, it mentions Costco. </li>
</ol>
<p class="ListHead"><b>A list of key people</b></p>
<ol class="none">
<li>This list of high-level employees could be used in vishing and whaling attacks. We also see the employees’ roles and ages, which might help monitor their social media. </li>
</ol>
<p class="ListHead"><b>A discussion of how Walmart uses technology</b></p>
<ol class="none">
<li>This enables us to see how it mitigates and perceives threats associated with its information technology infrastructure. </li>
</ol>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Insight about Walmart’s legal activity</b></p>
<ol class="none">
<li>This can give us additional context for the way the company operates or help us target someone in the legal department. </li>
</ol>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Information about the auditing firm that performed an independent, third-party audit</b></p>
<ol class="none">
<li>This gives us further context for our pretext. </li>
</ol>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Introductions of the board of directors and their backgrounds</b></p>
<ol class="none">
<li>This provides us with more information about how Walmart does business. It also provides us with information we could use to build believable pretexts to use against their associates.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other forms you should look for are 8-K (change in material status) and 10-Q (quarterly report). The 8-K typically involves the awarding or selling of shares of stock. The 10-Q is an incremental version of the 10-K produced quarterly, but in lesser detail.</p>
<h2 id="h1-500983c05-0005">Conclusion</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">This chapter illustrated the usefulness (and dangers) of social media and other publicly available resources. The information gathered in this chapter is a good foundation on which to build a social engineering attack. While we should weaponize only the information we need, it is important to talk about what we found but didn’t use in the report that we send our clients. After all, we are trying to help our client companies become more secure. We don’t just want to gain access, beat our chests, and then repeat the exercise the next time. </p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_70" title="70"/>OSINT is more than collecting everything that exists about a given target. Part of OSINT is analyzing data and figuring out ways to exploit it. To some, OSINT is just as much as a mode of thought as it is a technical capability. You do not have to be an elite hacker (in the technical sense) to be good, great, or even elite at OSINT. The same goes for social engineering. </p>

- en: The GSM Mobile World Congress (MWC) is the premier business event in the mobile
    industry. Companies and individuals gather to hear about new developments in the
    field, to meet with partners, to pitch their ideas, and to see what the competition
    is up to.

  zh: GSM 世界移动通信大会（MWC）是移动行业的首要商业活动。公司和个人聚集在一起，听取该领域的最新发展，结识合作伙伴，推销自己的想法，并了解竞争对手的动向。
- en: This event was particularly interesting in the early days of Android, as the
    field was changing rapidly with the constant evolution in smartphone capabilities.
    The Android leadership team made the trek each year to show what Android was working
    on, and to see what was happening in the ecosystem and with various potential
    partner companies.

  zh: 这个活动在 Android 的早期尤其有趣，因为这个领域随着智能手机功能的不断演变而快速变化。Android 领导团队每年都会跋涉到现场，展示 Android
    在做什么，并看看生态系统和各种潜在合作伙伴公司有什么新动态。
- en: Every year, Andy went to MWC in Barcelona and would see capabilities that Android
    needed to incorporate to stay current, or to take the lead. He sent reports back
    to Mountain View, asking for these new features to be developed, which, inevitably,
    came at the very end of a release, causing the team to jump rapidly into feature
    development at a time when the product really needed to focus on quality and stability
    prior to launching.

  zh: 每年，Andy 都会去巴塞罗那的 MWC，看到 Android 需要融入的功能，以保持领先或保持竞争力。他将报告发回 Mountain View，要求开发这些新功能，而这些功能通常会出现在发布的最后阶段，导致团队在发布前的这段时间里不得不迅速投入到功能开发中，而此时产品本应专注于发布前的质量和稳定性。
- en: These annual episodes were known as *Postcards from Barcelona*, where Andy would
    casually send in feature requests that were entirely too late to make a release
    . . . but which the team rushed to implement anyway, because it was Andy.

  zh: 这些年度事件被称为*来自巴塞罗那的明信片*，在这些事件中，Andy 会随意地提出一些功能请求，这些请求通常已经太晚无法包含在发布版本中……但团队还是匆忙地去实现，因为这是
    Andy。
- en: 'Hiroshi remembered these late feature requests. “It would be me sending these
    emails saying, ‘I just had a meeting with Andy and he really wants these things
    fixed before we ship.’ It always coincided with MWC. There are two reasons for
    that. One, that’s when our maintenance release^([1](#c36-footnote-1)) schedule
    usually was, so we would do our release in the Fall, and we’d have our big follow-up
    maintenance release at that time. So it was towards the end of the release cycle,
    when we’re trying to get launch approvals. Back then, Andy was the big approver.
    The other reason was because I was with him in Barcelona, I could show him: ‘Andy,
    we gotta launch this thing. Take a look, are you ready?’ And then always, almost
    on principle, he would point out at least one or two things, just because that
    was his style.”'

  zh: Hiroshi 记得这些迟到的功能请求。“那时我会发这些邮件说，‘我刚和 Andy 开完会，他真的希望在我们发布之前修复这些问题。’这总是和 MWC 时间重合。有两个原因。首先，那时候通常是我们的维护版本发布计划，所以我们会在秋天做一次发布，然后在那个时候有一个大的后续维护版本发布。所以它通常发生在发布周期的末尾，我们正试图获得发布批准。那时
    Andy 是最大的批准者。另一个原因是因为我和他在巴塞罗那，我可以直接给他看：‘Andy，我们得发布这个东西。看看，你准备好了吗？’然后几乎每次，他都会指出一两件事情，这几乎成了他的风格。”
- en: Andy’s late requests were also a consequence of the release schedule and the
    inherent latency of software development cycles. “There’s a lag from where we’re
    done with the software to when it actually shows up in some consumer’s hands.
    He didn’t like that lag, so he didn’t want to wait. When we said ‘next release’
    he knew that meant like six months, nine months, a year from now, and he was like,
    ‘I don’t want to wait that long. Do it now before you launch.’

  zh: Andy 的迟到请求也是发布计划和软件开发周期固有延迟的结果。“从我们完成软件到它真正出现在消费者手中之间有一个滞后的时间。他不喜欢这种延迟，所以他不想等。当我们说‘下一个发布’时，他知道那意味着六个月、九个月甚至一年的时间，他就会说，‘我不想等那么久，现在就做，发布之前先做完。’
- en: “So then I would like, tuck my tail, email the team saying, ‘Sorry, but. . .

- en: The GSM Mobile World Congress (MWC) is the premier business event in the mobile
    industry. Companies and individuals gather to hear about new developments in the
    field, to meet with partners, to pitch their ideas, and to see what the competition
    is up to.

- en: This event was particularly interesting in the early days of Android, as the
    field was changing rapidly with the constant evolution in smartphone capabilities.
    The Android leadership team made the trek each year to show what Android was working
    on, and to see what was happening in the ecosystem and with various potential
    partner companies.

- en: Every year, Andy went to MWC in Barcelona and would see capabilities that Android
    needed to incorporate to stay current, or to take the lead. He sent reports back
    to Mountain View, asking for these new features to be developed, which, inevitably,
    came at the very end of a release, causing the team to jump rapidly into feature
    development at a time when the product really needed to focus on quality and stability
    prior to launching.

- en: These annual episodes were known as *Postcards from Barcelona*, where Andy would
    casually send in feature requests that were entirely too late to make a release
    . . . but which the team rushed to implement anyway, because it was Andy.

- en: 'Hiroshi remembered these late feature requests. “It would be me sending these
    emails saying, ‘I just had a meeting with Andy and he really wants these things
    fixed before we ship.’ It always coincided with MWC. There are two reasons for
    that. One, that’s when our maintenance release^([1](#c36-footnote-1)) schedule
    usually was, so we would do our release in the Fall, and we’d have our big follow-up
    maintenance release at that time. So it was towards the end of the release cycle,
    when we’re trying to get launch approvals. Back then, Andy was the big approver.
    The other reason was because I was with him in Barcelona, I could show him: ‘Andy,
    we gotta launch this thing. Take a look, are you ready?’ And then always, almost
    on principle, he would point out at least one or two things, just because that
    was his style.”'

- en: Andy’s late requests were also a consequence of the release schedule and the
    inherent latency of software development cycles. “There’s a lag from where we’re
    done with the software to when it actually shows up in some consumer’s hands.
    He didn’t like that lag, so he didn’t want to wait. When we said ‘next release’
    he knew that meant like six months, nine months, a year from now, and he was like,
    ‘I don’t want to wait that long. Do it now before you launch.’

    the Arduino IDE, there are a number of problems that you may encounter.

    why they occur and how to fix them. When an error occurs, the monitor box at the
    bottom of the IDE will helpfully highlight the line of code that caused the error,
    as shown in [Figure A-1](app01.xhtml#chAfig1). This information will be invaluable
    to you in fixing your code.

- en: Check that each opening curly bracket (`{`) has a closing curly bracket (`}`)
    and, if not, add the closing bracket. Curly brackets define the start and end
    of a block of code, and every open bracket needs a closing bracket to complete
    a function or loop. In this instance, you would add a closed bracket at the end
    of your code.

    library in the library folder. Follow the instructions in “[Installing Libraries](pref02.xhtml#ch00lev1sec118)”
    on [page 8](pref02.xhtml#page_8) to make sure you’ve installed any libraries required
    by your code that are not included by default in the IDE. Remember that it is
    not enough to just download these libraries—you have to install them too.

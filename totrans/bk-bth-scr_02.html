<p class="chapterintro">If you are reading this book (and I’m pretty sure that you are), you are looking to write some Batch code. By the end of this chapter, you will have done just that, coding and executing what may be your very first bat file.</p>
<p class="tx">Along the way, I will introduce the Batch scripting language and its origins in the MS-DOS command prompt, along with the two types of files that contain its source code: the bat and cmd. I’ll also discuss editors, which are the primary tools for writing a bat file, and the options available to you. Finally, no introduction to the Batch universe would be complete without an overview of the interpreter.</p>

<h3 class="h" id="sec1"><span id="h1-9"/><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">The MS-DOS Command Prompt</span></h3>
<p class="tni">The MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System) command prompt lives on every computer loaded with Microsoft Windows. If you are of a certain age—that is, if you were around for the infancy of personal <span aria-label=" Page 4. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_4" role="doc-pagebreak"/>computers—you might remember that black rectangle (or an entire screen if you go back to the pre-Windows era) where you entered commands to perform various tasks such as installing or launching programs, or copying or deleting files. The average user rarely if ever deals with this anymore because graphical user interfaces have streamlined those tasks so that they can be performed in a few clicks, but it still exists.</p>
<p class="tx">To access the command prompt on your Windows computer, go to <b class="calibre10">Start</b> and enter <b class="calibre10">CMD</b>, which is short for <i class="calibre6">command</i>, in the search box. Hit <small class="calibre5">ENTER</small>, and the MS-DOS command prompt will open. From this prompt you can enter a number of commands. You can execute programs, copy files, or even delete your entire <i class="calibre6">C:\</i> drive. Don’t panic, though; you would have to know the command for that. I won’t get into all the possible commands here because that’s what this entire book is about, and even it isn’t exhaustive, but let’s look at one example. Say you’re working on a project with several documents in a folder. After working on those documents for a few hours each day, it’s a good idea to back up the files onto another drive. To do that, you could enter the single command in <a href="#Lis1-1" class="calibre3">Listing 1-1</a> into the command prompt and press <small class="calibre5">ENTER</small>.</p>
<span id="Lis1-1"/>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre11"><b class="calibre10">xcopy C:\</b><b class="calibre10"><var class="calibre12">YourPath</var></b><b class="calibre10">\*.* D:\</b><b class="calibre10"><var class="calibre12">YourBackUpPath</var></b><b class="calibre10">\ /F /S /Y</b></code></pre>
<p class="listingcaption"><span class="futura_std_book_oblique_i_">Listing 1-1: The command to back up some files</span></p>
<p class="tx">Don’t worry about the syntax yet (wait for <span class="xref"><a href="chapter7.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 7</a></span>). The important point is that you can enter this command into the command prompt each day to copy all of your files. You might protest that it’s far too easy to mistype something in this line, such as one of the two paths or one of those letters following the slashes at the end of the line, whatever the heck those are for. Wouldn’t it be easier to use Windows, that is, navigate to one folder, select all, right-click, select Copy, navigate to the other folder, right-click, select Paste, and click to verify the copy? I would agree that this would be easier than typing out the command, but notice that the Windows process involves eight discrete steps and likely a dozen or more mouse clicks.</p>
<p class="tx">A third option is easier than both the command prompt method and the click-intensive Windows method. That option is to program with the Batch scripting language.</p>

<h3 class="h" id="sec2"><span id="h1-10"/><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">The Batch Scripting Language</span></h3>
<p class="tni">Batch is an unfortunate handle for any coding language, scripting or otherwise. Some popular languages are distinctively named for coffee, gemstones, music notes, or British comedy troupes. Even the much-maligned COBOL has an acronym unique to itself, and when Pascal is mentioned, the 20th-century coding language usually comes to mind before the 17th-century mathematician. At the other extreme of the continuum, the term <i class="calibre6">batch</i> is banal; even in the context of computer science, it’s ambiguous. <i class="calibre6">Batch processing</i> is a generic term for the act of running several jobs or a large <span aria-label=" Page 5. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_5" role="doc-pagebreak"/>batch of data at once and is quite distinct from the topic of this book, Batch scripting.</p>
<p class="tx">Microsoft developed the Batch scripting or coding language in the early 1980s for the MS-DOS operating system, and it has been installed on every machine running Windows since 1985. I suspect that somebody at Microsoft who grew tired of typing a repetitive series of commands into the command prompt said, “Wouldn’t it be great if we could take these commands and batch them together into a single file that could then be executed quickly and easily?”</p>
<p class="tx">Those <i class="calibre6">batched</i> commands represented the genesis of Batch, the coding language. Individual commands don’t constitute a language; a language is a framework to execute those commands. Batching these commands into a file allowed for branching logic, complex loops, and reusable code—the makings of a real language.</p>
<p class="tx">Batch has many uses. Its command line origins make it an ideal language for computer or system administration: creating, copying, moving, and deleting files. Batch can also examine and modify directories and the registry and set up a computer’s environment.</p>
<p class="tx">A simple bat file can set some variables and execute programs written in many other languages. Batch can interact with a user, displaying information and gathering data. Files can be read, written, and altered. Rudimentary reports can be created, and before long you will see that Batch supports intricate and sophisticated scripts.</p>
<p class="tx">Before personal computers became available, other operating systems had their own scripting languages analogous to Batch. Unix shell scripts execute on Unix-based operating systems, and JCL, or job control language, is instrumental to the IBM mainframe. When introducing Batch to new co-workers familiar with the mainframe, I’ll dispense with rigor and describe it as “JCL for the PC.”</p>
<p class="tx">In my experience, knowledge of Batch among coders is broad yet shallow. (An image of a large group of coders, laptops in hand, standing in the kiddie pool with their pant cuffs rolled up, afraid to enter the adult pool, much less its deep end, comes to mind.) Most coders can create a simple Batch application but instinctively fall back onto other languages for more complex problems that could be more easily handled in Batch.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="sec3" epub:type="division">
<h3 class="h" id="sec3"><span id="h1-11"/><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">Bat Files</span></h3>
<p class="tni">Although the term <i class="calibre6">batch</i> is ambiguous, a bat file is known to most coders. A batch of commands is entered into a batch file (shortened to bat file). Hence, a <i class="calibre6">bat file</i> is a file containing Batch source code. (A <i class="calibre6">batphile</i>, however, is someone with a great enthusiasm for, or even a lover of, nocturnal flying mammals.) When a bat file is executed, a series of the commands it contains is performed until reaching either a command to terminate its execution or the end of the file.</p>
<p class="tx">Most Windows files have a file extension at the end of the filename after the dot. Modern Word documents end in <i class="calibre6">.docx</i>. Excel spreadsheets end in <span aria-label=" Page 6. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_6" role="doc-pagebreak"/><i class="calibre6">.xlsx</i>. Simple text files often end in <i class="calibre6">.txt</i>, and PDF files end in ... well, you have the idea. To distinguish a bat file from other files, it must have a <i class="calibre6">.bat</i> extension.</p>
<p class="tx">By default, file extensions aren’t shown after the filename in Windows, but we’ll need them. To show them, look for an option to show filename extensions under the <b class="calibre10">View</b> menu in Windows Explorer. If it isn’t readily obvious, search the web for “show filename extensions” and your operating system.</p>
<p class="tx">Now your files will show their extensions; for instance, your Word documents will likely be suffixed with <i class="calibre6">.docx</i>. More important, your bat files will be appended with <i class="calibre6">.bat</i>. Many refer to these as <i class="calibre6">batch files</i>, but in the pages ahead I’ll refer to them simply as <i class="calibre6">bat files</i>.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec4" epub:type="division">
<h3 class="h" id="sec4"><span id="h1-12"/><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">Your First Bat File</span></h3>
<p class="tni">Let’s create a bat file. To start, right-click on the desktop to bring up the context menu and select <b class="calibre10">New</b> <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">▶</span> <b class="calibre10">Text Document</b>. Rename the text file to something like <i class="calibre6">SaveProject.bat</i>. The name can be whatever makes sense to you, but the file extension after the filename must be changed from <i class="calibre6">.txt</i> to <i class="calibre6">.bat</i>. Right-click the file, select <b class="calibre10">Rename</b>, enter the new name and extension, and press <small class="calibre5">ENTER</small>. A pop-up will likely warn you that changing the extension might cause great harm. It will not; just select <b class="calibre10">Yes</b> to confirm. Right-click the new file on the desktop and select <b class="calibre10">Edit</b> (not Open; I’ll get to that momentarily). It should open for editing in Notepad.</p>
<p class="tx">Enter the two lines of text in <a href="#Lis1-2" class="calibre3">Listing 1-2</a> into your bat file.</p>
<span id="Lis1-2"/>
<pre class="pre"><code class="calibre11">xcopy <var class="calibre12">C:\YourPath\</var>*.* <var class="calibre12">D:\YourBackUpPath\</var>/F /S /Y
pause
</code></pre>
<p class="listingcaption"><span class="futura_std_book_oblique_i_">Listing 1-2: The entire contents of your first bat file</span></p>
<p class="tni">Change <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_italic_i_">C:\YourPath\</span> to the folder you want backed up and change <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_italic_i_">D:\YourBackUpPath\</span> to the folder to which you want to save everything. (I am assuming that your backup device, such as a flash drive, is assigned <i class="calibre6">D:\</i> as the drive, but it might be something else. If nothing else, just to see this work, you could even define a backup path also on the same drive.) Notice that the first line of code in <a href="#Lis1-2" class="calibre3">Listing 1-2</a> is identical to what we typed into the command prompt in <a href="#Lis1-1" class="calibre3">Listing 1-1</a>, but it is now followed by a second line containing a single word: <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">pause</span>.</p>
<p class="tx">After investing the effort to put this together, you can reap the benefits. Whenever you want to make this backup in the future, simply execute this bat file. To do so you have multiple options; one is to double-click its icon on the desktop, and another is to right-click the bat file and select <b class="calibre10">Open</b>. You might expect <b class="calibre10">Open</b> to open the file for editing, but it really executes the bat file.</p>
<p class="tx">That’s it. A window will open showing all the copied files along with the locations that they were copied from and to. The bat file will hold the window open until you press any key to close it. Without this, the copy would <span aria-label=" Page 7. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_7" role="doc-pagebreak"/>still happen, but the window would likely close so quickly you wouldn’t know whether it worked.</p>
<p class="warning"><span class="sans_dogma_ot_bold_b_1">WARNING</span></p>
<p class="warning-txt"><i class="calibre6">From time to time Windows file associations aren’t assigned properly. That is, Word documents should be associated with and opened by Word. Likewise, bat files should be associated with the Windows program that executes bat files. If your bat file opens in Notepad, for instance, the file association for files with the .</i><span class="copyright_accent">bat</span> <i class="calibre6">extension is broken. The fix for this varies depending on the operating system. Search the web for “bat file association fix” along with your operating system to learn how to fix the issue.</i></p>
<p class="tx">Almost anything that you can type into the MS-DOS command prompt can be coded into a bat file so that it can be executed easily and repeatedly. You don’t have to download anything from the internet. Everything you need is already on your Windows machine.</p>
<p class="tx">I prefixed the last paragraph with <i class="calibre6">almost</i> because certain commands, especially the all-important <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">for</span> command yet to be discussed, have slightly different syntaxes in a bat file versus inside the command prompt. Even more bizarre, a command in a bat file can occasionally produce slightly different output compared to the exact same command entered at the command prompt.</p>
<p class="tx">This book is geared to writing bat files, not using the command prompt, so all code listings found in this book will work in a bat file, and all examples of output will be the output of code from a bat file. The <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">help</span> command, also yet to be discussed, will explain any differences in syntax. By the same reasoning, this book doesn’t cover commands that are primarily used in the command prompt.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec5" epub:type="division">
<h3 class="h" id="sec5"><span id="h1-13"/><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">cmd Files</span></h3>
<p class="tni">In <a href="#Lis1-2" class="calibre3">Listing 1-2</a> we created a bat file with—I know I’m stating the obvious here—the <i class="calibre6">.bat</i> extension. With the release of Windows NT, Microsoft introduced a very similar file with the <i class="calibre6">.cmd</i> extension, a file that also contains Batch source code. Any Batch command from a bat file can be entered into a cmd file. In fact, if you rename your first bat file from <a href="#Lis1-2" class="calibre3">Listing 1-2</a> with a <i class="calibre6">.cmd</i> extension and execute it exactly as you did the bat file, you’ll get the same results.</p>
<p class="tx">There are some technical differences concerning how your computer executes the two types of files, but from a user perspective, they are nearly identical. The only significant difference (which I will discuss in <span class="xref"><a href="chapter21.xhtml" class="calibre3">Chapter 21</a></span>) concerns how and when the return code is set, and even then, that difference manifests itself only in a very narrow set of circumstances.</p>
<p class="tx">Nearly every mention of bat files throughout this book applies equally to cmd files, but I’ll refer to them solely as bat files for many reasons. In common usage among coders, <i class="calibre6">bat file</i> is the norm. A file with a <i class="calibre6">.cmd</i> extension will often be referred to as a bat file, but the opposite never occurs. The single-syllable word <i class="calibre6">bat</i> rolls off the tongue effortlessly compared to its vowelless alternative, which is usually referred to as a “see-em-dee” file, an <span aria-label=" Page 8. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_8" role="doc-pagebreak"/>exhausting three syllables when used often. One last not-so-insignificant reason: the cover art on the book you are holding. A book about cmd files would have been far less eye-catching.</p>
<p class="tx">Because cmd files are newer, one could argue that they’ll be better supported in the future and are the better option for new development. I can’t dispute that, but I still find myself creating files with the .<i class="calibre6">bat</i> extension, and Microsoft continues to support both. If cmd files have not supplanted bat files in the past three decades, I don’t envision the bat’s demise anytime soon.</p>

<h3 class="h" id="sec6"><span id="h1-14"/><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">Editor Recommendations</span></h3>
<p class="tni">I mentioned earlier that when you edit your first bat file, it’ll likely open in Notepad. Notepad is the barest of bare-bones editors for text files. Word is considered by many to be a bloated monstrosity by this stage of its evolution, but Notepad is just the opposite, devoid of useful features. It can be used for a simple bat file, but before we go any further, I must make the case for getting a better editor. By <i class="calibre6">editor</i> I mean a utility that allows you to open (not execute) a bat file in a window to read it and make modifications.</p>
<p class="tx">My personal favorite is Notepad++. On first hearing the name I mistakenly dismissed it as a glorified Notepad, but it really is a pleasure to use. Commands, variables, operators, labels, comments, and more items we haven’t covered yet are displayed in different colors to aid in readability. Most editors have that, but if you double-click a variable, it highlights not just that variable but also all the other instances of that variable in the file, making it even easier to find misspellings, although misspellings aren’t very common with Notepad++ because of its easy-to-use auto-complete functionality. If you enter a variable name such as <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">myVeryVerboseVariableName</span>—first off, shame on you, abbreviations were invented for a reason—the next time you start to type <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_">myVe</span>, Notepad++ will subtly give you the option of inserting the remaining 21 characters with a single keystroke.</p>
<p class="tx">Notepad++ is very configurable. If you find the orange color for variables a bit too harsh, you can change it to a burnt orange or maybe go in the direction of a mauve. It will also work for dozens of other programming languages, and best of all, it’s free. Just go to <i class="calibre6"><a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org" class="calibre3">https://<wbr/>notepad<wbr/>-plus<wbr/>-plus<wbr/>.org</a></i> or search the web for “Notepad++ download,” and you are a couple mouse clicks away.</p>
<p class="tx">UltraEdit is also a solid editor, and Visual Studio Code is fast becoming a very popular editor for many coding languages, including Batch. You’ll find several others on the internet, many of which are free. Download two or three and experiment, but whatever you do, don’t settle for Notepad.</p>

<h3 class="h" id="sec7"><span id="h1-15"/><span class="sans_futura_std_bold_b_">The Batch Interpreter</span></h3>
<p class="tni">Batch is a scripting language, not a compiled language. Compiled languages, such as Java, Visual Basic, and C# are written in text, but that text cannot be executed. Instead, the coder usually writes the program in an integrated development environment (IDE) where the click of a button <span aria-label=" Page 9. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_9" role="doc-pagebreak"/>or two runs the <i class="calibre6">compiler</i> to translate the code into an executable file. The resulting file is not at all human-readable, but it will be quite computer-readable and optimized for execution. The lack of readable text has the additional benefit of hiding any proprietary information from the user.</p>
<p class="tx">The next piece of this compiled-code puzzle is the <i class="calibre6">runtime</i>; runtimes come in different forms, but a runtime is loaded on a computer and is used to run any executable file written in a specific language.</p>
<p class="tx">As a scripting language, Batch is also written in text, but the rest of the process deviates greatly from compiled languages. There is no compiler and no runtime; instead, the <i class="calibre6">Batch interpreter</i>, or the <i class="calibre6">cmd.exe</i> executable file, effectively handles both roles. (Its 16-bit forerunner was <i class="calibre6">command.com</i>.) The Batch interpreter is sometimes referred to as the <i class="calibre6">command interpreter</i> or <i class="calibre6">command line interpreter</i>, but usually it is simply and unassumingly called the <i class="calibre6">interpreter</i>.</p>
<p class="tx">The interpreter executes the bat file containing the text. The lack of the intermediate compilation step does have some advantages. Before long, I’ll share some interesting Batch techniques available to us precisely because the code is not compiled, but it also presents some challenges to the coder. When a program is compiled, the compiler will catch syntax errors and even make suggestions on how to improve the code. For instance, a compiler will easily catch a missing parenthesis so the coder can fix it in seconds. A missing character in a bat file will not be caught until it is executed by the interpreter, and maybe not even the first time it executes. In this way, the interpreter plays one of the roles performed by a compiler—a very inefficient compiler.</p>
<p class="tx">The interpreter is much more analogous to a runtime. When the bat file described earlier in this chapter is opened or executed, a call is being put out to the interpreter to read in the bat file and execute it—or interpret it—line by line. This means that the bat file isn’t optimized for execution, and for better or worse, the code is available to any user with Notepad technology. Also, the bat file can be executed on any Windows machine because all such machines are loaded with the interpreter. A curious upshot is that later stages of a particularly long-running bat file can actually be coded as the prior logic is being executed, an impressive albeit not very useful feature.</p>
<p class="tx">All modern IDEs also have an animator or debugger, which allows you to execute code line by line, analyzing variables and maybe even altering them. You can set the execution to stop at a particular line or multiple lines. It’s a very useful tool for any coder, but Batch doesn’t support an animator. The life cycle of a bat file is as follows: it’s written, and it’s executed. That’s the list.</p>
<p class="tx">Some scripting languages, such as JavaScript, commonly work both ways—the source code can be run with an interpreter or be compiled into an executable file with products available from multiple companies. Nothing like that is in common use with Batch. Bat files are run only via the interpreter, and it’s important to understand what the interpreter is because I reference it often in the chapters ahead.</p>

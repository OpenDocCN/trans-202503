			</header>
			<p class="ChapterIntro"><a id="337"/>The idea of a <em>clone</em>—a linked copy of an object that updates itself when the
original changes—comes naturally from the vector way of thinking about graphics. In a sense,
a clone is not a real object—rather, it is just a command: "Display a
copy of the object here." The document stores that command, not a real object. An actual object instead of the
command is created only in the memory of an SVG application such as 
Inkscape when it displays the document.</p>
			<p>There are both artistic and technical reasons to use clones. Watching several objects
change, live, when you edit only one is an exciting experience that suggests many creative
possibilities. On the other hand, using clones instead of duplicates can make an SVG
document smaller and faster to display. Map symbols, repeated design elements such as
bullets or icons, various symmetric designs or patterns—all these are natural to do
with clones. Few other vector editors allow you to create live linked copies of objects
with such directness and ease as Inkscape.</p>

				16.1 <a id="338"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_338" title="338"/>Creating a Clone</h2>
			<p>
				To clone one or several objects, just select them and press Alt-D (or<span class="ui"><strong>Edit<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Clone<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Create Clone</strong></span>). The visible result of this is exactly the
same as that of duplicating (Ctrl-D): a copy of (each) selected object is
created and placed on top of the original. If you need to get a clone of several objects
as a whole, group them together and clone the group.</p>
			<p>
				A clone is a <em>linked</em> copy of an object, as <a href="#fig16-1">Figure 16-1</a> demonstrates.  What constitutes this link?</p>
			<p>
				Most important, a clone copies the original's <em>content</em>. If it is a clone of a
path (<a href="c12.xhtml#ch12">Chapter 12</a>) or a shape (<a href="c11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11</a>),  it exactly reproduces the form of the original,
and it updates automatically when you edit the original in the Node tool or in a shape
tool. If it is a clone of a text object, it has the same textual content and is also updated
live when you edit the original with the Text tool. Finally, if you clone a group, you can
then enter that group (<a href="c05.xhtml#section5.10">5.10</a>) to add, delete, or edit objects within the group—and
the group's clone will update immediately. On the other hand, since a clone has no content of its own, you cannot edit its
content—no node editing, text editing, or ungrouping is possible on a clone
so long as it remains a clone.</p>
			<a id="fig16-1"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="18/cl-basic.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 16-1: A clone is a linked copy of an object.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				What about <em>transforms</em>? If you scale, rotate, or skew the original, all of its
clones will do the same (<a href="#fig16-2">Figure 16-2</a>).  However, if you just move the original object, by
default the clone will <em>not</em> move (although that behavior can be changed, see
below). Of course if you select <em>both</em> the original and its clone, you can transform
them together—by moving, scaling, rotating, or skewing.</p>
			<a id="fig16-2"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="18/cl-transform.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 16-2: Clones respond to the original's transforms, except for
moving.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				You can also move, scale, rotate, or skew the clone completely independently of its
original. The clone's own transform is applied <em>on top</em> of the transform
inherited from the original. For example, if you squeeze a clone vertically and then rotate
its original, the clone will be both rotated and squeezed—but the vertical squeeze will be
applied to the shape <em>after</em> it is rotated, resulting in a skew, as shown in <a href="#fig16-3">Figure 16-3</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig16-3"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="18/cl-transform-combine.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>

of the transform inherited from the original.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="339"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_339" title="339"/>The <em>style</em> of the original is also passed on to its clones. If you paint the
original a different fill or stroke color, all of its clones will take the same color at
once. Conversely, if you try to paint a clone, it will simply refuse to change 
color, remaining true to its original. (Again, this rule has exceptions, as you will see
below.)</p>
			<p>This table summarizes various things you can and cannot do on a clone
and its original and how those changes affect one another:</p>

					<h2>Clones in SVG</h2>
					<p>
						In SVG, a clone is represented by an <code>svg:use</code>
element. Its <code>xlink:href</code> attribute contains a URL pointing to the original
of this clone. Per the SVG standard, this URL can point to any element, be it within the
same document or in a different document anywhere on the internet. However,
Inkscape does not support cross-document references, so any clone
created in Inkscape must have its original in the same document.</p>

			<h2>16.2 Transforming Clones</h2>
			<p>
				As you have seen, a clone can be transformed in any way, and this
transform is applied on top of the transform it inherits from its original. You can
use any transformation method—dragging with the mouse, transforming via keys (<a href="c06.xhtml#section6.5">6.5</a>),
aligning, distributing, and snapping all work on clones exactly as they do on regular
objects.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, transforms of the original are classified—by how they affect the
clones of that original—into two groups: simple moves and everything else. For
"everything else" (scales, rotates, and skews) the transform is passed on to
all clones. Simple moves, however, are treated differently.</p>
			<p>
				By default, Inkscape tries to isolate clones so that
they remain in place when the original is moved. Under the hood, this is done by
moving the clone in the <a id="340"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_340" title="340"/>opposite direction to compensate for the original's move. This works pretty intuitively and
is usually convenient; for example, you can take the original of a
large pattern of clones and move it away without disturbing the pattern. You can also
grab both the original and its clones and move them anywhere, and they would behave as
expected—that is, they move in parallel, even if the clone has a transform of its own.</p>
			<p>
				Users can modify this compensation behavior. The <span class="ui">Behavior<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Clones</span> page of the <span class="ui">Preferences</span>
dialog (<a href="#fig16-4">Figure 16-4</a>) contains the following options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="ui">Move in parallel</span> forces all clones, including those rotated or scaled, to always move
in parallel with the original, as if they were always selected together with it
(even if in fact they are not).</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Stay unmoved</span> (this is the default) forces those clones that were not
selected to stay unmoved (but those that <em>are</em> selected are moved as usual).</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Move according to transform</span> turns off any clone movement compensation. Now each clone,
selected or not, moves according to the transform inherited from its original, without
any attempt to compensate.  When complex transformations are in effect, the resulting
behavior may appear chaotic—but from SVG's viewpoint, it is the least intrusive option, since the
inherited clone transformations are not tampered with in any way.</li>
			</ul><a id="fig16-4"/>
			<figure>
				<img alt="" src="18/cl-move-compensate.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 16-4: Setting up movement compensation of clones</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Also, transforming clones does not honor the<span class="ui">Affect</span> buttons on the Selector controls bar (<a href="c06.xhtml#section6.11">6.11</a>): it always behaves as if
all of those buttons were pressed. You cannot scale a clone in such a way as to leave its
stroke width unchanged or its gradient unaffected—because what you're transforming is,
in effect, an image of the original, and that image cannot have a different stroke width
or gradient position compared to the original.</p>
			<a id="section16.3"/><h2>16.3 Styling Clones</h2>
			<p>I have already mentioned that clones inherit their style from their
originals: a clone of a red rectangle will be red. There are, however,
several exceptions and workarounds for this limitation.</p>
			<p>
				First of all, opacity (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.3">8.3</a>) and blur (<a href="c17.xhtml#section17.1">17.1</a>) are not subject to this limitation: you can easily
blur a clone or make it semitransparent. This is because these
properties <em>accumulate</em>—that is, if you blur something and then blur its parent,
those blurs add up, and the result will be more fuzzy than from either of the <a id="341"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_341" title="341"/>blurs taken
alone. This also means that if your original is <em>already</em> blurred or has less than
100% opacity, you can make its clone <em>more</em> blurred or <em>more</em> transparent, but
not less.</p>
			<p>
				The same applies to filter effects (<a href="c17.xhtml#ch17">Chapter 17</a>; actually, blur is just one of the
filters). You can apply any filter to a clone, and it will work on top of any filters
that the original of this clone has. For example, you can make the clone of a red
rectangle green or gray by applying a color-shifting filter.</p>
			<p>
				But what about plain fill or stroke colors? You can change them in a clone—but
only if the original cooperates. Namely, any style property you want to change in
a clone must be <em>unset</em> in the original. Unsetting (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.2">8.2</a>) is not the same as
setting to <code>none</code>: a property is unset when it is simply <em>not specified</em> for an object,
which allows its clone's property to take effect instead, as shown in <a href="#fig16-5">Figure 16-5</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig16-5"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="18/cl-paint.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 16-5: A clone can be painted if its original has the
paint unset.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Inkscape has a special button in the <span class="ui">Fill and Stroke</span> dialog, as well as a command in
the selected style indicator (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.6">8.6</a>), for unsetting the fill or stroke properties of an
object. An object with an unset stroke simply has no visible stroke, but if you unset its
fill, it is shown as black. If you want to unset some other style property,
use the <span class="ui"><strong>Selectors and CSS</strong></span> dialog (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.1">8.1</a>) to remove the property
you want to override in the clones.</p>
			<p>If you have a group as the original object, you can unset fill or stroke 
in some of the members of that group only, leaving others colored. Then, if you clone that group
and paint the clone, only the objects with unset properties will take on that 
color, whereas everything else will remain true to the original.</p>
			<a id="section16.4"/><h2>16.4 Chaining Clones</h2>
			<p>
				Duplicating (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.5">4.5</a>) or copying and pasting a clone gives you another clone <em>of the same
original</em>. (You can copy and then paste a clone into a different document but only together
with its original; if you try to paste a clone alone, it will end up<em>orphaned</em> and invisible.) Duplicating an existing clone is often convenient, as
this duplicate will also get the first clone's own transform and style, if it had
any. Of course, you can also get another clone simply by cloning the original again.</p>
			<p>
				Nothing prevents you from cloning a clone object itself. The resulting
object—a <em>clone of a clone</em>—will still display the content of its
ultimate original, but its link to it is no longer direct: it is now a grandchild, not a child, of the
original. Such a
grandchild clone inherits transforms and style first from the original, then from its
parent clone, and finally, applies its own transform and style on top of all that. Such
clone-of-clone chains (they can be of any length) are rarely useful; in
almost all cases, multiple clones of the same original can be used instead, as <a href="#fig16-6">Figure 16-6</a> demonstrates.</p>
			<a id="fig16-6"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="18/cl-cloneofclone.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 16-6: Instead of clones of clones, use multiple
clones of the same object.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="342"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_342" title="342"/>To figure out whether the object you selected is a clone—and if so, what it is a clone of—look 
at the status bar. It will describe your selected object as, for example,<span class="ui">Clone of: Group</span> or <span class="ui">Clone of: Clone of:
Path</span>. If you want to know which object is the parent of the selected
clone, press Shift-D: Inkscape will draw a dashed line from the clone to its
original (that line will disappear after one second) and select the original
object, as shown in <a href="#fig16-7">Figure 16-7</a>.</p>

			<h2>16.5 Unlinking and Relinking Clones</h2>
			<p>
				A clone's live link to its original is its main feature—that is, after all,
why we use clones. This link facilitates a lot of tasks in complex designs; for
example, you can use clones for identical buttons or bullets on a website mockup, and then
change all such elements at once by changing their common
original. However, sometimes this link becomes an obstacle. If you want to edit 
a clone independently of its original, you need to<em>unlink</em> the clone.</p>
			<p>
				Select a clone (or clone of a clone) and press Shift-Alt-D (or select <span class="ui"><strong>Edit<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Clone<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Unlink
Clone</strong></span>). Visibly, nothing changes, but the object is no longer a clone—it is now a copy of the original, with all its additional transforms and style
preserved, but now independent and fully editable. You can unlink multiple
clones at once.</p>
			<p>
				What happens if you delete the original of a clone? By default, its clones are
automatically unlinked—that is, turned into copies of the object being killed. On the same<span class="ui">Behavior<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Clones</span> page of the <span class="ui">Preferences</span> dialog you can, however,
force clones to disappear when their original does (<a href="#fig16-8">Figure 16-8</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig16-8"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="18/cl-originaldeleted.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 16-8: Setting up the behavior of clones when the original is
deleted</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="343"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_343" title="343"/>When you <em>relink</em> a clone, it remains a clone, but its original changes. Here's how to do it.
Suppose you have a clone C of an object A, but you want it to
be a clone of B instead. Select B and copy it to the clipboard (Ctrl-C),
then select clone C and do <span class="ui"><strong>Edit<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Clone<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Relink to Copied</strong></span>. After that, C
becomes a clone of B—which, depending on what B is, may result in C changing shape,
style, position, transform, or any combination of these, as shown in <a href="#fig16-9">Figure 16-9</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig16-9"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="18/cl-relink.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 16-9: Relinking a clone to a different original</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Manual relinking is a rarely needed operation. More useful is <em>automatic relinking on
duplication</em>. Imagine you have a complex group of objects, some of which are
clones of others—for example, a 3D-like graphic button where the shadow is a blurred
clone of the main shape. Now, imagine you select this entire group and duplicate it. What
happens?</p>
			<p>
				Within the group, each regular object will duplicate to a regular object, and each
clone will duplicate to a clone. However, the clones will still be linked to the
originals in the source group—which is most likely not what you wanted! It would be
more natural for the shadow in the duplicated group to be a clone of the shape <em>in the
same group</em>, not some other group far away. To ensure this, on the same<span class="ui"><strong>Behavior<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Clones</strong></span> page, check <span class="ui"><strong>Duplicating original+clones/linked offset: Relink duplicated clones</strong></span>. Now
after duplication, you will have two independent buttons, each with its own editable shape and
a shadow linked to that shape (<a href="#fig16-10">Figure 16-10</a>).</p>

			<h2>16.6 Tiling Clones</h2>
			<p>
				The powerful <span class="ui">Create Tiled Clones</span> dialog (<span class="ui">Edit<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Clone<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Create
Tiled Clones</span>) is a tool for creating multiple clones at once, arranged into all kinds of spatial and color patterns ranging from
absolutely regular to totally randomized. As a bonus, you can also make the pattern of the clones trace the
image underneath.</p>
			<a id="section16.6.1"/><h3>16.6.1 Size and Bounding Box</h3>
			<p>The first step is to select the
object you will be cloning. I recommend using a group for that; even if you have a
single object, group it (Ctrl-G). This way, you will later be able to add
more objects to the original group and the clones will reflect that. Place the original
into the top-left corner of the area you want to fill with the pattern.</p>
			<p><a id="344"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_344" title="344"/>In the <span class="ui"><strong>Create Tiled Clones</strong></span> dialog, start by specifying the size of the tiling (<a href="#fig16-11">Figure 16-11</a>). You can 
give the number of rows and columns in the pattern; or, if you have some specific area to
fill, you can type or paste its width and height. Note that too-large patterns—with
more than a few thousand clones—can slow down Inkscape considerably.</p>
			<a id="fig16-11"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="18/cl-tile-size.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 16-11: Setting the size of a pattern</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Once you set all other parameters as described below (or just
trust the defaults), click the <span class="ui"><strong>Create</strong></span> button. The pattern appears on the
canvas, but you still have the original object selected. The <span class="ui">Remove</span> button
deletes any previously tiled clones of the selected object. Note that <span class="ui">Create</span> first does <span class="ui">Remove</span>—that is, when you click <span class="ui">Create</span>, any existing tiled clones
(but not regular clones created by Alt-D) are removed and replaced by a new
pattern.</p>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Unclump</span> button works exactly as the same-name button in the <span class="ui">Align
and Distribute</span> dialog (<a href="c07.xhtml#section7.5.2">7.5.2</a>), except it moves all the tiled clones of the
selected object rather than all selected objects, as shown in <a href="#fig16-12">Figure 16-12</a>. Unclumping is especially useful for
making randomized patterns more uniform without regularizing them. 
The <span class="ui">Reset</span> button changes all
parameters of the dialog back to the defaults.</p>
			<a id="fig16-12"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="18/cl-tile-unclump.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 16-12: Unclumping a randomized
pattern</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Use saved size and position of the tile</span> checkbox has no effect when
you create a pattern for the first time. However, if you modify the object you're tiling
and create the pattern again, normally Inkscape will use the altered size of the object,
which may result in the pattern changing its overall size and the alignment of the tiles. To
make Inkscape use the same tile size as the last time you created a pattern from that
object, even if the object's size has changed, check this checkbox. For example, you
can create a pattern from a rectangle, fine-tune all the parameters, then
scale up the original rectangle and re-create the pattern with this checkbox
checked. That will give you the exact same pattern as last time, but with larger tiles 
overlapping each other.</p>
			<p>
				All tiled patterns include a clone that exactly (except when randomized)
overlays the original object. This means if you lose the selection of the original,<a id="345"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_345" title="345"/>simply clicking the original's location will select the overlying clone and not the
original. Use Alt-click (<a href="c05.xhtml#section5.9">5.9</a>)
or select any of the clones and press Shift-D to
jump to the original.</p>
			<a id="section16.6.2"/><h3>16.6.2 Symmetry</h3>
			<p>
				The first tab in the dialog is titled <span class="ui">Symmetry</span>. It contains a list of<em>symmetry groups</em> from which you select one to use for your pattern. Each symmetry
group is a specific way to transform the clones to form the pattern.
The number of these groups is exactly 17 because it has been proven that any regular pattern on a plane can be
classified into one of these 17 types; see
the Wikipedia article on "wallpaper group" for extensive details and examples.
Here is a brief overview of the symmetry types:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt><strong>P1</strong></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						This is the simplest possible symmetry: the pattern tile is simply repeated in a
rectangular grid without any rotations or flips (<a href="#fig16-13">Figure 16-13</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig16-13"/><figure>
						<img alt="" src="18/cl-tile-P1.svg.png"/>
						<figcaption>
							<p>Figure 16-13: The basic symmetry: P1</p>
						</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</dd>
				<dt>P2, PM, PG, CM, PMM, PMG, PGG, and CMM</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						These symmetries use rotations by 180 degrees as well as vertical and horizontal flips in
various combinations (<a href="#fig16-14">Figure 16-14</a>). However, all of these symmetries use the same rectangular grid
placement as P1, with the width and height of each unit of the grid being the same as those of the original object.</p>
			<a id="fig16-14"/><figure>
						<img alt="" src="18/cl-tile-P2.svg.png"/>
						<figcaption>
							<p>Figure 16-14: Symmetries with flips and 180-degree rotations</p>
						</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</dd>
				<dt><a id="346"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_346" title="346"/>P4, P4M, and P4G
				</dt> <dd>
					<p>
						These symmetries involve
rotations by 90 degrees, so they produce square-based patterns. The P4M symmetry results
in partial overlapping of rectangular tiles; with it, you can use triangular tiles to avoid
overlapping and fill the plane, as shown in <a href="#fig16-15">Figure 16-15</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig16-15"/><figure>
						<img alt="" src="18/cl-tile-P4.svg.png"/>
						<figcaption>
							<p>Figure 16-15: Symmetries with 90-degree rotations</p>
						</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</dd>
				<dt>P3, P31M, and P3M1</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						These symmetries involve rotations by 120
degrees and are thus roughly triangular in appearance (<a href="#fig16-16">Figure 16-16</a>). Again, P31M creates a more dense
pattern with partially overlapping tiles, so you can use a "pie slice" shape to fill the
plane with this symmetry without overlapping.</p>

						These symmetries rotate the tiles by 60 degrees, forming snowflake-like
hexagonal patterns (<a href="#fig16-17">Figure 16-17</a>). Of them, P6M again overlaps the tiles and requires a "pie slice" shape to
fill the plane without overlapping.</p>

			<p>For "dense" patterns (P4M, P31M, P6M) that overlap the tiles, try creating the pattern and then scaling the original down. This will make the
pattern sparser, and its characterisic logic will be easier to understand.</p>
			<p>
				When working on a <em>tessellation</em> (a pattern that completely fills the plane without
gaps or overlapping), it would be very difficult to create the required shape of the tile in
isolation, even if you understand how your chosen symmetry works. Instead, just
start with any random shape, create the pattern from it using <a id="347"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_347" title="347"/>the desired symmetry, and
then node-edit the original path watching how the pattern's clones repeat its
changes. In this way, you can easily produce a surprisingly sophisticated tessellation
(see <a href="c25.xhtml#section25.2">25.2</a> for an example).</p>
			<a id="section16.6.3"/><h3>16.6.3 Shift, Scale, and Rotation</h3>
			<p>
				The next three tabs in the dialog allow you to specify the <em>additional</em> transforms
to be applied to the pattern's tiles—that is, transforms on top of the shifts,
rotations, and flips created by the chosen symmetry group (<a href="#fig16-18">Figure 16-18</a>).</p>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>You can specify
all of these additional transform components
separately per row and
per column, and each value can include a degree of randomness. You can specify, for
example, an equivalent of "Make tiles in each next row 20 percent taller, rotate tiles in each
next column by 5 degrees, and make the rotation angle vary randomly by 10 percent." All shifts,
scales, and randomization values are measured as percentages of the original object's
dimensions.</p>
			<p><a href="#fig16-19">Figure 16-19</a> shows how it works for shifts.</p>

			<p>
				Negative shifts are possible, too. Naturally, to get all the clones to overlay the
original, you need to specify <span class="ui"><strong>Shift X:</strong></span> –100% per column and <span class="ui"><strong>Shift Y:</strong></span> –100% per row. If
you combine this with rotation per row, it's easy to create a flower or a clock face, as shown in <a href="#fig16-20">Figure 16-20</a>.</p>

			<p><a id="348"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_348" title="348"/>You can make the values <span class="ui">Alternate</span> (for example, scale clones in every second
row), as shown in <a href="#fig16-21">Figure 16-21</a>. The <span class="ui">Cumulate</span> checkbox forces the values of shift or scale to
accumulate. For example, normally a shift of 10 px per column means that each column is
shifted by 10 px relative to the previous column; if you check <span class="ui">Cumulate</span>, the
same value would make every column shift 10 px further than its predecessor—that 
is, the second column is 10 px from the first, the third is 20 px from the second, and so on.</p>

				What is considered a "row" and a
"column" when calculating transform values with complex symmetries? Inkscape draws complex patterns by symmetric
clusters (of 3, 4, 6, or 12 clones, depending on the symmetry), going from one cluster to
the next horizontally within a row. In other words, clones that belong to one cluster
are considered to be in the same row but in different columns. This means that the<span class="ui">Per row</span> values shift rows of clusters or scale clones in
each cluster uniformly, whereas <span class="ui">Per column</span> values affect each clone
independently—and, as a result, clusters lose their symmetry, as <a href="#fig16-22">Figure 16-22</a> demonstrates.</p>

				<img alt="" src="18/cl-tile-complexsym.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 16-22: Transforming complex symmetries</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>If you want to space out
symmetric clusters in both dimensions, just create a single cluster with your chosen
symmetry, group it, and tile the group with a simple P1 symmetry, possibly with
alternating shifts.</p>
			<a id="section16.6.4"/><h3>16.6.4 Blur and Opacity</h3>
			<p>
				This tab of the dialog looks and acts very similar to the transform tabs; here, you can
adjust the blur and opacity of the clones in the pattern, per
row or per column, with optional alternating or randomization (<a href="#fig16-23">Figure 16-23</a>). Remember <a id="349"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_349" title="349"/>that you can
only make a clone more blurred or more transparent than its original, but not less.</p>

			<h3>16.6.5 Color</h3>
			<p>
				As you've seen in <a href="#section16.3">16.3</a>, if you want to paint a clone with its own
color, you need to unset the corresponding property in the original. Once you've done
that for the paint you're going to change (fill, stroke, or both), the <span class="ui">Create Tiled
Clones</span> dialog allows you to create a variety of color patterns.</p>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Color</span> tab of the dialog looks similar to the tabs you've already
seen (<a href="#fig16-24">Figure 16-24</a>). Here, you can vary any of the three components of the clone color in the HSL
model—hue, saturation, and lightness (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.4.3">8.4.3</a>)—per row or per
column, as well as alternate or randomize the changes. You also need to specify the<span class="ui">Initial color</span> from which all those variations will start; just click the color
swatch and use the color selector dialog.  Remember that the original must have
unset fill or stroke; otherwise, this tab will have no effect!</p>
			<a id="fig16-24"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="18/cl-tile-color.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 16-24: Setting an initial color for the <span class="ui">Color</span> tab</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				For example, by starting with red and varying the hue by 5 percent per row and per
column, you get a slanted rainbow (see <a id="figref12"/><a href="c15b.xhtml#ill-fig12">Figure 12 in the color insert</a>).</p>
			<a id="section16.6.6"/><h3>16.6.6 Tracing</h3>
			<p>
				The last tab of the <span class="ui">Create Tiled Clones</span> dialog (<a href="#fig16-25">Figure 16-25</a>) 
is different. Here, you can
make the pattern <em>trace</em> any image on top of which it is built—that is,
make some aspects of each clone depend on what is immediately below it. The
background image you're tracing can be an
imported bitmap (such as a photo) or any vector drawing; it makes
no difference to the tracer what to pick its values from.</p>
			<a id="fig16-25"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="18/cl-tile-trace.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 16-25: The <span class="ui">Trace</span> tab</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="350"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_350" title="350"/>The tab contains three main areas that correspond to the three main steps of the
tracing algorithm. First, you pick some value at the location of each clone; second, you
do some optional processing with that value; and third, you apply the result to some
aspect of the clone. Enable the controls of the tab by checking the <span class="ui"><strong>Trace the
drawing under the tiles</strong></span> checkbox.</p>
			<p>
				For the input value, you have the option of picking the <span class="ui">Color</span>,<span class="ui">Opacity</span>, or any single component of the color in RGB or HSL models. The value
picked for each clone is averaged over the entire rectangular area that will be
covered by that clone's bounding box. All these options produce a single numeric value in the range
from 0 to 1, except <span class="ui">Color</span>, which picks all three components of the color as a
composite value.</p>
			<p>The possible ways to process the value include:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Gamma correction</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Positive gamma
shifts the picked value up; negative shifts it down.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Randomization by a given percentage</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The value will have a random component of the given size: 0% randomization means
the value is exactly as picked, 100% randomization means it is totally random and does
not depend on the picked value at all.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Inversion</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Turns high values into low and vice versa.</p>
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>
				If a color is picked, this processing is applied to each of its
components independently (see <a id="figref13"/><a href="c15b.xhtml#ill-fig13">Figure 13 in the color insert</a>).</p>
			<p>
				Finally, the resulting value can be applied to the clone's probability of
presence (0 means the clone is absent at this location, 1 means it's present, and
intermediate values make it appear with the given probability); color (this can
directly reuse the background color if it was picked, otherwise it translates single
values to shades of gray); size (from disappearance at 0 to its full size at 1); or
opacity (smaller values make the clone more transparent). You can enable any number of these options
at the same time; for example, you can pick lightness, invert it, and
apply it to both the opacity and size of the clones (see <a id="figref14"/><a href="c15b.xhtml#ill-fig14">Figure 14 in the color insert</a>).</p>

				16.7 <a id="351"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_351" title="351"/>The Symbols Dialog</h2>
			<p>
				You can think of <em>symbols</em> as clones organized into libraries for reuse. Inkscape's <span class="ui">Object<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Symbols</span> dialog
(Shift-Ctrl-Y) gives you access to a number of common graphic symbol sets that come with Inkscape. You can also
use it to create and manage your own collections of custom symbols.</p>
			<p>Inkscape's prepackaged symbol sets should give you an idea of what kinds of objects it may make sense to organize into a library:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>AIGA (American Institute of Graphic Arts)</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Urban signage, used mostly in airports: arrivals, customs, barber shops—very recognizable and very 1970s.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>US National Park Service Map Symbols</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Campgrounds, guided trails, post offices—stylistically similar to AIGA symbols.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Flow chart shapes</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The conventional blocks of flow chart diagrams, such as storage, extract, merge, display, and so on.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Logic diagram symbols</dt>

				</dd>
				<dt>Word balloons</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Various shapes of word balloons to be used in comics.</p>
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>
				To insert a symbol in your document, just drag in from the dialog onto the canvas. The object you get behaves as if it is a clone of something, but the
status bar description says <em>Symbol</em>; nevertheless, if you want to edit this object, you can do the same <span class="ui">Edit<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Clone<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Unlink Clone</span>
as you would do for a clone. (If all you want to do is move, scale, or rotate the symbol, you don't need to unlink it.)</p>
			<p>
				The search field in the <span class="ui">Symbols</span> dialog allows you to find a symbol with a certain word or phrase in its description. The search is performed in the currently
selected symbol set or in all of them if you select <span class="ui">Symbol set: All symbol sets</span>.</p>
			<p>
				If you switch the dialog to <span class="ui">Current document</span> (<a href="#fig16-26">Figure 16-26</a>), you will see that it already contains all the symbols you have added from the standard libraries (if any).
This is where you can also add your own objects as symbols: select an object and click the <span class="ui"><strong>Add Symbol</strong></span> button in the lower-left corner. Once the new symbol
is in the list, the original object can be deleted and replaced with a copy of the symbol. Your new symbol will be inserted with the same size and styling
as it had when you created it.</p>
			<p>
				To delete a symbol from the document, select it in the list and
use the <span class="ui"><strong>Remove Symbol</strong></span> button; after that, an actual copy of the symbol is placed on the canvas, and all instances of this symbol are converted into clones
of this visible object.</p>

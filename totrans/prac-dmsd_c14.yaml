    shelf-stable food in the kitchen is far more sensible than walking for miles to
    a nearby reservoir or trapping squirrels and raccoons in a community park.

    in the middle of a prolonged power outage, a small generator or a battery bank
    can get you back online so you can get a sense of what’s going on in other parts
    of town. At the same time, however, shopping for gear can easily turn into a habit:
    the thrill of unboxing new gadgets becomes an end unto itself and one can always
    find a way to justify adding another item to the towering pile of high-tech toys.'

    way, this accessory is just cool: we imagine ourselves strolling through a post-apocalyptic
    war zone, carrying out acts of valor with not a worry in mind. In reality, this
    costly gadget offers limited protection against an unlikely threat and is bulky
    and uncomfortable enough to preclude almost any casual use. Alas, in more than
    a decade in the prepping community, I must have tried to talk sense into at least
    a hundred people who were contemplating buying one, yet I don’t think I’ve ever
    managed to dissuade a single person from the plan.'

    you make should be subordinate to an entry in a well-researched response plan—and
    it should be the simplest and most effective way of solving the problem at hand.
    A bizarre fire-starting protocol that involves 9V batteries, steel wool, and taxidermied
    squirrels is probably not nearly as good as a disposable lighter or two.

    just to avoid frantically flipping through the manuals by candlelight, and it’s
    not just because mastering certain tools takes a fair amount of practice and muscle
    memory. More simply, it’s because quality assurance mishaps happen pretty often;
    if you have several dozen items in your survival stash, chances are at least one
    of them isn’t working correctly. Camping trips can be a fantastic way to test
    some of the gear, but so can a drill where you don’t use running water or electricity
    for a couple of days, or you don’t buy any groceries for a while and cook with
    what you have.

    to be replaced every now and then, and a year or two down the line, you might
    not remember how many cans of cheese or throwing stars are in your kit. An up-to-date
    spreadsheet with item names, descriptions, counts, and expiration dates is what
    sets prepping apart from simply hoarding junk.

- en: Lastly, every gadget should be a component of a well-defined, purpose-built
    kit, and the kits shouldn’t be allowed to grow with no end in sight. For example,
    a small tote in the trunk of your car, meant to help with roadside emergencies
    or workplace accidents, probably doesn’t require weeks’ worth of food or a camping
    stove. Similarly, a larger selection of boxed supplies meant for evacuating from
    natural disasters may not require tents and hunting gear, at least not in regions
    where motels and grocery stores are plentiful.

    the main categories of gear that may play a role in a balanced emergency response
    plan.

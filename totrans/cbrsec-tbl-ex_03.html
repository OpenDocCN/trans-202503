<p class="CO">Before you can develop the tabletop exercise, you need to lay its foundation. This chapter will walk you through that process, outlining the factors you should consider in the preparation and planning stage. The advice in this chapter comes from hundreds of conversations with our clients, who frequently ask the same several questions that you’ll need to answer prior to constructing the tabletop exercise.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">These foundational questions include the following: Who from the executive level is providing support? What are the organization’s goals and objectives? What is the exercise’s tenor? Whom should you invite? What logistics are involved, and who will be handling them? Those responsible for developing the tabletop exercise, as well as executives wanting to understand their function in the process, tend to care about the answers to these planning questions. After all, the exercise will take place in front of their <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_24" aria-label="24"/>peers, leadership, and vendors, and in such a situation, nobody wants to be caught off guard.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec1">&#13;
<h3 class="H1" id="sec1"><span id="h-30"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Securing Executive Sponsor Support</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Perhaps the most important step to prepare for a tabletop exercise is securing support from an executive sponsor. The sponsor’s exact role and identity will vary depending on the type of exercise you’re pursuing, the maturity of the organization, and the participants in the exercise, but sponsors are generally two or more rungs higher on an organizational chart than the highest-ranking participant.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec2">&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec2"><span id="h-31"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Choosing an Appropriate Executive Sponsor</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Consider how you might choose the executive sponsor in each of the following tabletop exercise scenarios:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Testing whether the organization’s IT help desk is able to recognize a cybersecurity event and escalate the issue to the proper points of contact</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Testing the organization’s ability to perform internal and external communications during a large, public-facing incident</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">In the first scenario, the highest level of management participating in the tabletop exercise would likely be the IT help desk manager. In this case, it would be appropriate for an information security officer, a security director, or someone in a similar position to function as the executive sponsor.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">The second scenario would likely involve representatives from departments like marketing, legal, public relations, information technology, and information security, in addition to other cross-functional positions. Due to the level of visibility, range of functions, and likelihood that the exercise will include a variety of senior management, it would make sense to select the chief information officer, the chief operations officer, or a similar executive as the sponsor.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">The executive sponsor should understand the processes being tested but doesn’t necessarily need an in-depth mastery of the topic. Their primary value comes from their awareness of the organization’s cultural norms, their long-standing relationships with a variety of employees, and their influence among those they are sponsoring. As you’ll see when we cover the expectations of the executive sponsor, the occasional email from them may be all you need to move your stalled tabletop exercise along or get participants to focus on the event.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">It might also be beneficial to select an executive sponsor with an interest in the goals and objectives of the tabletop scenario. (We’ll cover these topics in <a href="chapter2.xhtml#h-33">“Defining the Exercise’s Goals and Objectives”</a> on page 26.) For example, if an organization wishes to educate stakeholders about recent privacy legislation, you might choose a senior executive in the legal department. Alternatively, if the organization hopes to rehearse <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_25" aria-label="25"/>public-facing aspects of an incident, such as how to communicate with the public, you might want to request a chief communications officer as the executive sponsor.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec3"><span id="h-32"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Outlining the Executive Sponsor’s Responsibilities</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Once you’ve identified the executive sponsor, what should you expect of this role? The executive sponsor won’t construct the PowerPoint deck, nor will they compose meeting agendas for the tabletop participants. However, their participation will trigger meaningful engagement throughout the tabletop exercise.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec4">&#13;
<h5 class="H3" id="sec4"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">The Announcement</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Any new project involving a variety of participants will require some formal announcement. The executive sponsor should be a part of this announcement to clarify that the exercise is important to the organization and that they will track its progress and participate. The announcement should make clear to all participants that the executive sponsor has put their organizational weight behind the initiative.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec5">&#13;
<h5 class="H3" id="sec5"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Planning Meetings</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Even the simplest tabletop exercise requires planning. The executive sponsor doesn’t have to attend every planning meeting; however, they should join at least one of them—ideally the first, which lays the foundation for future planning and reinforces their support. Additionally, should the executive sponsor have concerns about the direction of the tabletop exercise, they’re able to express these as early as possible. By attending these meetings, they can better understand the status of the exercise, make sure the plan aligns with the organization’s interests, and help remedy potential roadblocks. Perhaps most importantly, their attendance reinforces their continued commitment to the exercise.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec6">&#13;
<h5 class="H3" id="sec6"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Communication</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Whenever the opportunity presents itself, the executive sponsor should reiterate the importance of the exercise. In some cases, they may need to sell the exercise to peers. It’s not uncommon to face resistance from individuals across the organization, including those at the executive level, who believe the exercise isn’t important to their role or team. You’d be surprised by how often a simple email from the sponsor can magically clear schedules and rearrange priorities.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Furthermore, the executive sponsor likely oversees regular meetings at the organization. By making a few comments at the start of a meeting about how pleased they are with the exercise planning and thanking the group for devoting time thus far, they can communicate its importance.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec7">&#13;
<span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_26" aria-label="26"/>&#13;
<h5 class="H3" id="sec7"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Legal Concerns</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">The tabletop exercise’s materials and discussions may benefit from guidance from the organization’s legal counsel, who can weigh in on any issues that emerge during planning. This is particularly true for organizations that operate in a highly regulated industry or engage in business with other entities. Some organizations may also choose to have the legal team direct the exercise. In such cases, the executive sponsor may be a member of the organization’s legal team, or a legal representative may serve as a co-sponsor. In all cases, the executive sponsor should be aware of any potential legal issues.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec8">&#13;
<h5 class="H3" id="sec8"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Attendance</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Perhaps the most important obligation of the executive sponsor is to attend the tabletop exercise. The sponsor’s name on the calendar invite will encourage attendees to prioritize the meeting and participate actively, rather than passively listen with their head focused on their email inbox. If the sponsor’s presence creates a sense of stuffiness, however, you should make an effort to ensure that all participants feel comfortable speaking up—for example, by having the sponsor issue a friendly statement reinforcing the value of participation.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec9">&#13;
<h5 class="H3" id="sec9"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Participation</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Keep in mind that the executive sponsor’s attendance and comments during the tabletop exercise may have a chilling effect on the discussion. For this reason, their participation will likely be minimal and limited to short comments where their input is necessary.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">This isn’t a universal rule, however, and their input may depend on the specifics of the tabletop as well as the organization’s culture. Above all, their participation should be purposeful and align with the exercise’s goals and objectives.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec10"><span id="h-33"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Defining the Exercise’s Goals and Objectives</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">In the business world, <i>goals</i> are understood to be broad, long-term results that an organization would like to achieve. <i>Objectives</i>, or intermediary steps in the pursuit of goals, are short term and defined with greater granularity. For example, a college senior at a four-year university studying information technology might have the goal of securing a job with an information security team. Their objectives might be to finish their degree, earn the Security+ certification, and land an internship. The objectives are specific and feed into the overall goal.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">You might conceive of a tabletop exercise as either a goal or an objective. Say an organization has a goal of all key staff members becoming familiar with the incident response plan. A tabletop exercise may be only <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_27" aria-label="27"/>one of several steps it takes to familiarize them with the plan, making the exercise an objective. On the other hand, the successful completion of a tabletop exercise could itself be the goal, in which case objectives might be educating the staff about the incident response plan, exploring a ransomware event’s impact on operations, or testing the incident management process.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Most organizations view the tabletop exercise as an apex event in line with a goal and treat it as the culmination of a series of preparatory tasks. Following this approach, let’s examine a few common objectives for an exercise.</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="NOTE"><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="NOTE-TXT"><i>Your organization likely has more than one relevant objective; to realize maximum value, you should try to define several before developing your tabletop exercise.</i></p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec11"><span id="h-34"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Rehearsing the Incident Response Plan</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">When organizations create an incident response program, they typically first develop an incident response plan and playbooks with a corresponding incident response team, and then rehearse the plan via a tabletop exercise. This process allows the organization not only to determine whether the incident response plan meets its needs but also to find any holes in it.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Alternatively, organizations that already have a plan in place may also want to rehearse their plan to build confidence in its process and procedures.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec12">&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec12"><span id="h-35"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Understanding Organizational Incident Response Roles</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">A common objective of a tabletop exercise is to help participants understand how a cybersecurity incident can quickly careen beyond the realm of information security and involve a variety of nontechnical employees. To demonstrate this, you could develop a scenario that pulls in a wide range of participants.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Be thoughtful about whom you include, however. Otherwise, the participants may find themselves wondering why they’re there. Rarely does a cybersecurity incident require only a small team, and a properly developed scenario can help participants—whether they come from marketing, legal, or finance—better understand their role in the response.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Organizations might also want to conduct such a tabletop exercise whenever there’s turnover within the organization, changes in the team structure, or acquisitions and divestitures that shrink or grow the team. Each of these situations may impact who is a part of the response to an incident, and a tabletop exercise can help participants reorient themselves.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec13"><span id="h-36"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Assessing Vendor Response</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">External vendors often play a role in the incident response effort, whether they’re a managed security services provider (MSSP), an external legal <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_28" aria-label="28"/>counsel, a breach coach, or some other entity. Even vendors that have little to do with information security, such as an organization that prints and mails statements for a financial institution, can become involved in an incident. Tabletop exercises are an excellent way to assess how well the vendor and organization coordinate during an incident and identify any gaps in the response. At a minimum, the tabletop exercise provides an opportunity for the internal information security team to foster a collaborative working relationship with the external vendor.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec14"><span id="h-37"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Evaluating Communication Processes</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Communication processes can quickly break down during an incident if the organization is not well prepared, and requirements from cyber insurance and regulatory bodies only add to their complexity. Tabletop exercises are an excellent way to ensure that the organization has well-defined communication processes, knows who will handle internal and external notifications, and can meet any notification deadlines.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec15"><span id="h-38"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Senior-Level vs. Operational-Level Exercises</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Tabletop exercises are typically divided into two camps: senior level and operational level. <i>Senior-level exercises</i> generally focus on strategic concerns of the business, organizational authorities, and decision-makers. <i>Operational-level exercises</i> address the technical, hands-on aspects of the response.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">For example, if an objective of the exercise is to familiarize the communications department with the nuances of responding to a cybersecurity incident that has bubbled into the public domain, this would be a senior-level tabletop. Alternatively, if the focus is on the practicalities of implementing network containment strategies to mitigate the effects of malware, the exercise would be an operational-level tabletop.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Senior-level exercises typically bring together managerial roles from different departments, while technical-level exercises involve technical team members and some members of their management. Of course, technical employees can still use the exercise to discuss nontechnical issues, such as policy constraints, that pertain to their positions. <a href="#tab2-1">Table 2-1</a> lists some topics appropriate for each type of exercise.</p>&#13;

</table>&#13;
<p class="TX">The choice of a senior-level tabletop exercise doesn’t necessarily mean that the organization is more mature. Instead, it reflects the focus of the tabletop. If the exercise explores strategic business issues, it’s likely to be senior level. An organization doesn’t need to have performed several operational-level tabletop exercises to “graduate” to senior-level exercises.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">If an organization has the necessary resources, it might run connected operational-level and senior-level tabletops. These <i>tandem exercises</i> enable an organization to explore a single topic (such as ransomware) by focusing one session on the technical issues, then moving into a second session focused on strategic elements. Each session should be treated as its own self-contained tabletop exercise, with separate attendees and specific areas of focus. While tandem exercises are more resource intensive, they have several benefits:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">They take advantage of economies of scale during the planning process.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">They convey an incident’s technical and strategic considerations.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">They engage roles across the business, demonstrating that a single cybersecurity event has wide-reaching implications.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">With the proper planning, a tandem exercise also affords an opportunity to create a more dynamic experience. For example, a member of the operational-level tabletop cohort can give the senior-level tabletop cohort a briefing on technical issues the previous exercise attendees have observed and any actions they’ve taken. <span class="Xref1"><a href="chapter6.xhtml">Chapters 6</a></span> and <span class="Xref1"><a href="chapter7.xhtml">7</a></span> cover example scenarios you could use in tandem exercises.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec16"><span id="h-39"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Determining Who Should Participate</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">In addition to whether you’re performing a senior- or operational-level tabletop exercise, the scenario topic is what usually determines who should attend the tabletop. For example, if a senior-level tabletop exercise <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_30" aria-label="30"/>explored data breach obligations, members of the legal team would be at the top of the attendance list, and if an operational-level tabletop exercise focused on technical controls and strategies to contain a ransomware outbreak, participants should include information technology and information security staff.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Other times, the incident response plan will define the list of participants for you. This plan should contain roles, usually broken into operational and senior level, to call upon during an incident, such as human resources, disaster recovery, and system administrators. The incident response plan should also define a primary and secondary point of contact for each role, both of whom you could invite to the exercise.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">In some cases, the exercise’s topic might be appropriate for a mix of senior- and lower-level staff members; however, combining these parties may be unwise. In mixed groups, the conversation could focus on issues that are of interest to one group but not the other, causing a subset of the participants to check out. Furthermore, the presence of participants from the upper echelon of the organization may have a chilling effect, discouraging lower-level staff members from contributing valuable feedback.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Finally, be selective about who should join. Casting too wide of a net will leave participants without significant opportunities for participation, and they may end up frustrated that they wasted their time. The best tabletops tend to have 10 to 15 attendees, making them large enough to include many roles but small enough to create a collaborative environment. However, don’t be afraid to run a tabletop exercise with fewer attendees. Even small information technology and information security teams of only two to four staff members may find it valuable to discuss the response to a cybersecurity incident.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec17">&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec17"><span id="h-40"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">External Vendors</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Your organization likely works with a variety of vendors that impact its information security posture. You may want to include them in your exercise if they’ll have a role to play during a cybersecurity incident. For example, consider the following vendors:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">An outsourced, part-time virtual chief information security officer (vCISO)</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">An MSSP security operations center (SOC) that is responsible for identifying, containing, and addressing cybersecurity incidents</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">A printing and mailing firm that sends monthly mortgage statements, account summaries, and other printed material for a financial institution</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">The communications and marketing firm responsible for maintaining social media channels and updating the organization’s website</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">A manufacturer that remotely logs in to a specialized metal fabrication system to perform troubleshooting and firmware updates</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">An offsite storage facility responsible for securing tape backups</li>&#13;
<li class="BL"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_31" aria-label="31"/>Physical security resources tasked with providing access to buildings and securing facilities</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">A vendor that operates a Software as a Service (SaaS) application to provide weather forecast data for flight planning services</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">A tabletop exercise is a way for the organization to pull vendors into the response process to learn how they could offer support as well as any limitations they have.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Perhaps most importantly, if a cybersecurity incident involved a failure originating from a vendor, such as a vendor-maintained system with poor password practices, understanding how the vendor would escalate the incident to the organization would enable both parties to identify potential gaps in the relationship. This last point is especially salient, as the internet is rife with stories about such failures. Consider bullets three and five from the preceding list: a printing and mailing firm and a metal manufacturer don’t serve an information security role, but a failure in either could cause a major incident nonetheless.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">However, avoid pulling too many vendors into a tabletop exercise. In some cases, it may not be appropriate to invite more than a single vendor. Each vendor has a unique relationship with the organization and is under pressure to perform satisfactorily; if they don’t, they know their contract might not be renewed. You should always take great care to reinforce that the exercise is an opportunity to forge a stronger relationship and isn’t intended to put the vendor in the hot seat.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Finally, if you plan to discuss sensitive topics, it may be inappropriate for an external party to join. Their inclusion should be purposeful and directly align with your goals and objectives. Don’t extend such invitations unless the executive sponsor and internal legal counsel have given their permission, and follow the organization’s existing information-sharing procedures.</p>&#13;

<h5 class="BT" id="box-5"><span class="SANS_Dogma_OT_Bold_B_11">CASE STUDY: A VENDOR-FOCUSED EXERCISE</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="BTNI"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">High Five Commercial (HFC), which owned marquee commercial properties in the southeastern United States, wanted to perform a tabletop exercise to gauge its preparation for its number one risk: an information system failure related to its building technologies, which consisted of banks of elevators, HVAC systems, and controlled entry systems used to grant physical access. HFC invited its elevator maintenance provider, Mitchell Elevators, to participate, as the provider had recently begun diagnosing issues by remotely connecting to the computers running the elevators. Given that many of HFC’s buildings were 20 stories or more, issues impacting elevators could plausibly present a major safety hazard, not to mention an accessibility problem for many tenants.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">The tabletop exercise scenario was simple: malware had infected the elevator computer systems while Mitchell Elevators performed maintenance using</span> <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_32" aria-label="32"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">a USB device containing malicious software. Although Mitchell Elevators wasn’t pleased with the premise, it conceded that there was precedent for it, as such attacks had occurred in the industry in very rare circumstances. Regardless, the Mitchell Elevators crew remained good sports; HFC was a client they could not afford to lose.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">In the discussion of the scenario, which involved the elevator systems failing around the holidays, several findings emerged:</span></p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Mitchell Elevators believed the event would likely require replacing several computer systems at the HFC properties, and because of logistical factors (namely, the elevators were made by a German engineering firm, and spare parts were not readily available), the replacement would take several days.</span></li>&#13;
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Because the incident occurred over the holidays, Mitchell Elevators wasn’t sure they had enough technicians available to perform such a labor-intensive replacement.</span></li>&#13;
<li class="BBL"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">The passwords Mitchell Elevators used to connect to a virtual private network to remotely access the elevator computers did not conform to HFC’s password policy. However, HFC had not informed Mitchell Elevators of this policy.</span></li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="BTX"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">The tabletop wasn’t adversarial; prior to the exercise, HFC emphasized that it didn’t intend to find fault with Mitchell Elevators, and when gaps emerged, its staff didn’t criticize the vendor. The outcome? Mitchell Elevators adjusted its password practices on all HFC systems to conform to HFC’s policy. HFC requested that Mitchell Elevators maintain replacement backup computer systems to eliminate the need to import them on-demand from Germany and ensure that there was staff available to assist with large issues at an HFC property during the holidays. Mitchell Elevators was happy to oblige and built the costs into the next contract year. Perhaps most importantly, HFC’s and Mitchell Elevators’ staff bolstered their trust in each other.</span></p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec18"><span id="h-41"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Legal Support</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">It isn’t uncommon for some form of litigation to emerge after a cybersecurity incident, so it’s essential to include legal resources in the incident response process. Additionally, because the initial hours of an incident may become a focal point in future litigation, an organization’s legal resources must provide guidance about maintaining <i>legal privilege</i>, a rule that can keep communications and other work products confidential. Misconceptions regarding privilege run rampant, so organizations should rely on qualified legal guidance on this front.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">For organizations that have in-house counsel, the process of including legal team members in the tabletop exercise may be as simple as sending a friendly email. Organizations without in-house legal counsel should pull in an external legal resource to participate in the tabletop exercise. External <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_33" aria-label="33"/>counsel usually bills hourly, but because the legal team may appreciate this opportunity to strengthen the bond with its client, it may categorize the exercise as relationship building and participate free of charge.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">In some cases, the organization may discover potential legal issues that fall outside the scope of its external legal counsel. For example, the organization might need legal guidance on performing data breach notifications in another country, while the retained external counsel focuses solely on employment issues and trade secrets. In such a situation, the organization may decide to secure specialized supplemental external counsel to fill this gap and support its unique needs.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec19"><span id="h-42"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">The Development Team</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">You also need to consider who will participate in the tabletop exercise development process. It is perfectly acceptable for one person to create all facets of a tabletop exercise; however, the most effective exercises include multiple individuals with different skills, personalities, and job tenure.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">To diversify the team, consider including members from outside the cybersecurity field. Employees from human resources could be helpful if, for instance, incident responders neglected to contact HR during a past incident to protect an employee from disciplinary actions. Audit and risk management, which have a vested interest in identifying and remediating risk within the organization, could be included as well. You might also find it beneficial to include a senior employee who can open doors and understand the nuances of relationships between departments.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Most optimal development teams are composed of two or three individuals. This lets the team divide the workload, share their knowledge, and add creativity to the exercise. It also provides redundancy in case one team member becomes ill before the exercise, is reassigned to an emergency project, or leaves the organization. We’ll go over some common roles for team members here, but keep in mind that some exercises might not need every role. Don’t include roles unless they provide clear value.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec20">&#13;
<h5 class="H3" id="sec20"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">The Development Lead</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">The development lead is responsible for planning and executing the tabletop exercise. In organizations that maintain a mature incident response plan, the plan usually defines the individual tasked with this role. Ideally, the plan should identify a <i>specific</i> individual and not a generic category, such as information security, which could diffuse responsibility. If the plan doesn’t specify an individual, choose a more senior employee based in information technology, information security, or similar. The development lead should have the following:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">An in-depth knowledge of how the organization functions</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">An understanding of the information systems and security controls in place</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">A leadership role, likely responsible for incident response</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">The respect of many employees across the organization</li>&#13;
<li class="BL"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_34" aria-label="34"/>Excellent interpersonal communication skills and a proven track record of building coalitions across functions</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Natural and relaxed presentation skills</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Existing relationships outside of information technology</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">If no candidate possesses all these traits, prioritize the soft skills. You can always make up for a lack of technical knowledge with other members of the team; however, to create a successful exercise, you’ll need a leader with superb communication skills and the ability to galvanize others.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">While the development lead should be a senior employee, this person should be a few rungs down the organizational ladder from the executive sponsor.</p>&#13;

<h5 class="H3" id="sec21"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">The Facilitator</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">The facilitator is the face of the tabletop exercise during the event. The development lead is a logical choice for this role, as they are intimately familiar with the scenario and various ways of exploring it; however, it is perfectly acceptable to have separate individuals fulfill each role. In addition, the facilitator should be:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">At ease presenting in front of audiences composed of their peers and senior leadership</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Skilled at keeping the discussion on track while simultaneously identifying additional points that warrant attention</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Able to tactfully and respectfully encourage participants to engage in the tabletop exercise and avoid one or two participants dominating the event</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Adept at quickly building a rapport with attendees to encourage a wider participation</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Able to think on their feet</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Comfortable with the specific intended attendees (such as executives)</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">Even if all other facets of the development process execute flawlessly, the facilitator could make or break the tabletop exercise. <span class="Xref1"><a href="chapter4.xhtml">Chapter 4</a></span> discusses the facilitation role in depth.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec22">&#13;
<h5 class="H3" id="sec22"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">The Subject Matter Expert</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Depending on the exercise topic, it may be beneficial to pull in a subject matter expert who can weigh in on issues pertaining to specific systems that are less familiar to other development team members. For example, if the scenario focuses on the organization’s new cloud environment, a cloud infrastructure expert could ensure that the team understands the technical nuances of the topic. Other scenarios that could benefit from a subject matter expert include the following:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">An energy company whose pipelines contain unique operational technology systems wants to explore how threat actors might alter its pipeline safety systems.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_35" aria-label="35"/>A credit union wants to explore how threat actors could compromise the global financial payment system SWIFT.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">A cruise ship operator plans to explore how a compromise of a ship-wide wireless internet system could impact guest safety or ship operations.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">In each of these situations, the development team would need in-depth knowledge of information systems to craft a relevant and believable tabletop exercise. Note, though, that a subject matter expert doesn’t necessarily need to focus on technical aspects of the exercise. The expert may come from legal, marketing, or other teams.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Finally, it may be appropriate to also have the subject matter expert attend the tabletop itself as a passive member in the audience. If a participant asks an in-depth question about a specific system that the facilitator isn’t able to address, the subject matter expert can provide immediate clarification.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec23">&#13;
<h5 class="H3" id="sec23"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">The Trusted Agent</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">If you plan to use a consultant to develop the tabletop exercise, or you aren’t personally familiar with the topic and its participants, consider appointing an internal trusted agent. The trusted agent is essentially a type of subject matter expert assigned to work with an external consultant. (For more on working with outside consultants, see <a href="chapter2.xhtml#h-58">“Outsourcing Tabletop Exercises”</a> on page 47.) The trusted agent should know the details of the scenario and can suggest alterations to the consultant based on their knowledge of the organization.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Trusted agents are useful in large enterprises consisting of tens of thousands of employees, where the development team may not personally know the participants or clearly understand the workings of the relevant teams. However, as someone who will have inside knowledge of the exercise scenario, the trusted agent generally shouldn’t participate in the tabletop itself. If they must participate, they should make minimal contributions and avoid revealing details of the scenario not yet known to the participants.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec24">&#13;
<h5 class="H3" id="sec24"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">The Observer</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Some organizations may wish to have a passive observer participate in the exercise. The passive observer does as the name suggests: they observe the tabletop without interacting. Reasons to use an observer include the following:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Enabling an interested party to understand the processes involved in responding to a cybersecurity incident</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Allowing a representative from legal to better understand unexpected legal issues that may emerge during an incident</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">Take care to ensure that the observer won’t impact the tabletop exercise. For example, the presence of a chief executive at a tabletop about the help desk could stifle constructive communication.</p>&#13;

<h5 class="H3" id="sec25"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">The Evaluator</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Given the number of tasks the facilitator must handle, they might find it helpful to enlist someone else to evaluate the process and note any weakness or strengths discovered during the exercise. Like the observer, the evaluator is a passive role. The evaluator could even be the observer or a co-facilitator, a position discussed further in <span class="Xref1"><a href="chapter5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>.</span></p>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec26"><span id="h-43"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Logistical Considerations</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Before the exercise itself, you’ll have to perform many of the event planning activities necessary for any large activity. For example, in-person tabletop exercises will require conference rooms with the appropriate amenities. You must also identify and address any attendee concerns. No one should enter the tabletop without the opportunity to ask questions, correct any misperceptions, and douse their residual fears.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">This section will also cover various time-consuming tasks that could be added to the development team’s list of to-dos. Depending on factors like the size of the development team, the style of the tabletop exercise, and the number of attendees, you might wish to assign a project manager to some of these tasks.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec27">&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec27"><span id="h-44"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Hosting Remote vs. In-Person Exercises</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">During the COVID-19 pandemic, many organizations began performing tabletop exercises remotely. While tabletops can succeed in a remote environment, in-person exercises tend to be more intimate. The facilitator and team members can greet participants personally as they enter the physical space and engage in small talk. During the actual tabletop exercise, the facilitator can also read body language and assess participants’ behaviors, which can help clarify their reactions to points brought up in the exercise. Remote exercises immediately handicap the facilitator; the usual handshake won’t occur, and visual cues may be easier to miss or absent altogether. In addition, in-person exercises make it easier for participants to interact directly with each other to explore certain issues, perhaps during a lunch break.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Some organizations opt for hybrid tabletop exercises, with some participants physically present in a conference room and others connected via video or phone. Facilitating a hybrid tabletop exercise is especially challenging, however, because the in-person participants will inevitably command the forum, and both they and the facilitator can easily forget about the remote attendees. <span class="Xref1"><a href="chapter4.xhtml">Chapter 4</a></span> explores other factors you should consider when facilitating such an exercise.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">When deciding whether to hold a remote or in-person tabletop exercise, ask yourself why the exercise is being performed. Often, one of its objectives is to form stronger bonds among participants, which often happens due to the inevitable “watercooler moments” that occur before and after the exercise. If the goal is to bring together employees who are largely unfamiliar <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_37" aria-label="37"/>with each other, in-person tabletop exercises will pay the most dividends and are worth the investment. However, if participants are already very familiar with each other, a remote tabletop exercise may be sufficient.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Also consider the organizational culture. Some companies don’t use remote work due to their centralized work locations, industry norms, or other factors. Senior-level staff members also have a tendency to favor in-person collaboration and are generally assigned to a central location like the company’s headquarters, so remote tabletop exercises might not make sense for this group.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec28"><span id="h-45"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Determining the Duration</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">While there are always exceptions, most effective tabletop exercises clock in at two to three hours. More time devoted to the exercise does not necessarily mean that it will be more comprehensive; eventually, you’ll reach a point of diminishing returns as the discussion and attention spans start to wane. That said, consider these additional factors when planning the exercise’s duration:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Senior-level tabletop exercises are more likely to encounter time constraints, and it is rare for executives to participate in a tabletop exercise longer than two hours.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">For remote exercises, shorter tabletops are more prudent. In today’s distraction-rich environment, it’s all too easy to dive back into email or chat conversations when not in view of your peers.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">It is important to get the duration right; if participants feel that their time wasn’t effectively used, they’ll be less willing to participate in future exercises.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec29">&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec29"><span id="h-46"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Choosing a Date and Time</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Before planning any of the logistics, identify calendar constraints. For senior-level tabletop exercises, timing could be the most critical factor to consider when you are planning the event. The senior leadership of some organizations may meet only once a quarter. In these cases, you may have to first define the target date and then work backward.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Let’s examine a few other considerations for choosing a date:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Avoid Mondays and Fridays. It’s very common for employees to take one of these days off to extend their weekend.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Factor in cultural norms that can influence vacation schedules, such as long summer breaks in certain countries, holidays unique to certain faiths or ethnicities, and the start of hunting or fishing season.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Add in buffers around significant holidays to account for longer vacations.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Be considerate of attendees with school-age children and account for the academic calendar.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_38" aria-label="38"/>Avoid the dates of major operating system patches, such as Microsoft’s monthly Patch Tuesday, especially for operational-level tabletop exercises in which technical employees will participate.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Avoid times of year that are busy or dedicated to high-profile work. These could include the holiday shopping season for a retailer, the end of a semester for a university, or days when publicly traded companies announce their earnings reports.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">For international teams, be cognizant of various holidays specific to particular countries or a workweek that deviates from the usual Monday through Friday.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">Don’t be surprised if a conflict emerges after you’ve chosen an initial date for the exercise. Unless you have a hard deadline, it’s acceptable to reschedule the tabletop exercise. Keep an alternative date in mind from the beginning, but don’t disclose it until it’s needed; in most organizations, competing priorities always emerge, and the event with the most flexibility (such as the one with a known alternative date) will likely be the one that gets rescheduled.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Choosing the specific time of day for the exercise also requires considering a variety of factors. For example, some organizations may have a culture of avoiding early or late meetings. Others have significant obligations at certain times; for example, a distribution company may need to process overnight orders in the morning. Finally, for global organizations with employees spread between, say, the United Kingdom and Canada, you’ll need to aim for a later start for the United Kingdom employees and an early start for their Canadian counterparts.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">A common strategy is to hold the tabletop exercise during lunch. An exercise that takes place between 11 <small>AM</small> and 2 <small>PM</small> provides an opportunity to cater lunch and break for a meal. (Be sure to ask about attendees’ dietary requirements ahead of time and accommodate any requests.) During the lunch break, attendees and the facilitator can mingle, discussing issues that have emerged in the scenario thus far and identifying future collaboration opportunities.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec30"><span id="h-47"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Securing a Facility</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Unless the tabletop exercise will be held remotely, the development team must find a facility. Typically, you’ll reserve a conference room available to the organization or rent a space at an alternative location.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec31">&#13;
<h5 class="H3" id="sec31"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">Conference Rooms</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Many organizations have multiple conference rooms to choose from, and planning a tabletop exercise well in advance lets you select an appropriate one. What makes for the “right” conference room? Consider the following factors:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="EX3"><b>Convenience for attendees</b> Some organizations have sprawling campuses or multiple buildings scattered across an urban center. Take stock <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_39" aria-label="39"/>of the attendee list and make a good-faith effort to choose a location that is central to the majority of attendees.</p>&#13;
<p class="EX3"><b>Priority of stakeholders</b>  While you should try to choose a location that is convenient for all attendees, you may need to make concessions for a single person or a small group that is central to the tabletop exercise. For example, if it is critical to have the CISO as a part of the tabletop exercise but they can only attend at a particular facility with a conference room, that need may outweigh the convenience of other attendees.</p>&#13;
<p class="EX3"><b>Audiovisual needs</b> If the tabletop has specific audiovisual needs—for example, projectors, cameras, microphones, screens, and other accessories that enable a participant to join remotely or help convey the material effectively—select the conference room that is most likely to accommodate them. <a href="chapter4.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> explores this topic in more depth.</p>&#13;
<p class="EX3"><b>Number of attendees</b>  You should know the number of attendees well in advance to select an appropriately sized conference room. A room that’s too small will be uncomfortable for attendees, while one that’s too large can feel cavernous and unwelcoming.</p>&#13;
<p class="EX3"><b>Social distancing</b>  While we all hope we don’t face another global pandemic anytime soon, COVID-19 taught us that there are times when you need to accommodate some degree of social distancing. (Of course, if any participant is feeling unwell or showing symptoms of illness, it’s best to stay home.)</p>&#13;
<p class="EX3"><b>Accessibility</b>  Some employees may have accessibility requirements, such as wheelchair access or assistive technologies for those with hearing or visual impairments.</p>&#13;
<p class="EX3"><b>Facilitator space</b> The conference room should have adequate space for the facilitator to set up and present in front of attendees.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="TX">Also consider the optics of the conference room you choose. Hosting a tabletop exercise in the musty old conference room in the basement conveys the message that the exercise isn’t a priority, and negative first impressions can be hard to overcome.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec32">&#13;
<h5 class="H3" id="sec32"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_B_11">External Sites</span></h5>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Not every organization will have access to the appropriate facilities. In these cases, you can rent an alternative facility, such as a hotel, co-working space, or banquet room at a restaurant or brewery. When evaluating potential off-site facilities, consider the following questions:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Is the facility conveniently located for most attendees? Choosing a location requiring a two-hour commute is a surefire way to alienate attendees before the event starts.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Does the facility meet the development team’s technology requirements? These requirements usually include a projector, a screen, Wi-Fi, and easily accessible electrical outlets.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_40" aria-label="40"/>Can the facility support remote attendees? If a handful of attendees are connecting remotely, select a higher-quality facility with embedded cameras and audio devices to better enable their participation. You’ll also need sufficient internet bandwidth.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Is the facility private? Renting a space with significant foot traffic (such as a hotel conference room near the lobby reception area) may attract unwanted attention from curious passersby.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Does the facility have amenities to make the tabletop exercise more enjoyable? These may include beverage or meal service and comfortable seating.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">Choosing an external site can mitigate any potential downsides of using organizational facilities. Meeting in the executive conference room on the highest floor of the corporate headquarters may intimidate certain attendees, making them less likely to speak up. At an external site, participants might be more likely to offer constructive criticism of the organization. Plus, the external location could present an opportunity for a post-tabletop bonding experience, such as a meal or activity.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">However, always evaluate the appropriateness of using the outside space. Attendees may find themselves discussing sensitive topics, such as the organization’s weaknesses, so the space should be private, and if the organization works with unique trade secrets or classified weapons systems, working off-site might not be an option.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec33"><span id="h-48"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Setting the Tone</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Before the tabletop exercise, determine the tone of your interactions with your participants. While there is no one-size-fits-all formula, consider the following approaches:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="EX3"><b>Educational</b>  If the participants are new to tabletops or to cybersecurity, or if the purpose of the tabletop is to validate your processes after a process change, you may want to take a more educational and hand-holding approach. Place emphasis on aligning suggested actions to the incident response plan, as well as educating participants about their roles.</p>&#13;
<p class="EX3"><b>Collaborative</b> If the participants have a range of experience in cybersecurity, have likely experienced a cybersecurity incident in the recent past, and want to explore how well any documented processes will hold up in a cybersecurity incident, take a more collaborative approach. This could include helping participants explore issues as they emerge while also raising additional areas of concern that haven’t been addressed.</p>&#13;
<p class="EX3"><b>Challenging</b> In the most advanced kind of exercise, participants are likely industry veterans who have experienced many cybersecurity issues, and the organization’s processes are well documented. For such an audience, you can afford to take a more tactfully aggressive stance by challenging participants’ answers, pointing out areas of weakness, and pushing the team to improve.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_41" aria-label="41"/>In general, consider the industry and organizational experience of those in the tabletop exercise and let that dictate the tone. Industry veterans probably don’t want to face a drill sergeant, but they might benefit from a facilitator who is able to tactfully explore questionable or problematic answers and bring deficiencies to light.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Also consider the organization’s cybersecurity maturity spectrum. If the company has historically treated cybersecurity as an afterthought, a collaborative or hand-holding approach would be beneficial, as it would meet participants where they are. The team could get their feet wet, discussing and learning basic response steps and best practices, instead of making their first foray into incident response during an actual engagement.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Lastly, if the organization is primarily performing the tabletop to gather stakeholders and build trust, the tone of the tabletop should reflect this goal. But if the organization wishes to dig into the roles and responsibilities expected of stakeholders, it may be prudent to adopt a more aggressive demeanor. However, always remain professional, polite, and tactful. Adopting a challenging approach doesn’t give you a license to be condescending, insulting, or overly pedantic.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Make sure the development team (including the executive sponsor) agrees upon the tone from the outset of the exercise’s development and remain consistent through the entire process, including in email communications and summaries.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec34"><span id="h-49"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Notifying and Preparing Exercise Attendees</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Once you’ve selected a date and time and secured a facility, it’s time to begin communicating with your expected attendees and other interested parties. In short, you must formally announce the tabletop exercise. This notification shouldn’t be haphazard but rather part of a multipronged effort to clarify the exercise’s goals and objectives, as well as what you expect from attendees. Some participants might respond with a battery of questions, and an effective communication strategy can allay any fears far in advance of the exercise. This section describes several components of the strategy used to prepare attendees for the exercise.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec35">&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec35"><span id="h-50"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">The Executive Checkpoint</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">One way to initially announce the basic details of a tabletop exercise is via the executive sponsor. It’s likely that your sponsor regularly communicates with a larger team about business updates, the status of initiatives, hiring, and so on. These checkpoints provide an opportunity for the sponsor to discuss the exercise, explain its purpose, and describe why the organization has chosen to invest in the activity. Because the sponsor is in a position of authority, they can also communicate the importance of the exercise.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">In their message, it could be helpful for the executive sponsor to highlight a recent cybersecurity incident familiar to the workforce, whether it be a high-profile news story or an issue that occurred within the organization <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_42" aria-label="42"/>itself. Ideally, this should help participants understand why the tabletop is being performed. In addition, the executive sponsor can briefly name the members of the development team, the development lead, and the facilitator, as well as disclose next steps.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Most importantly, this message shouldn’t go into much depth and should convey a positive attitude. If the sponsor strikes a negative tone (for example, “I know no one wants to do this, but let’s just get through it”), attendees might get the impression that this is just another check-the-box affair not worth their effort.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec36">&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec36"><span id="h-51"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">The Initial Email Notification</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Following the executive sponsor’s comments, it’s time to connect with the attendees. For the sake of consistency, assign a single person to perform all communications going forward. This may be the project manager, the facilitator, the development lead, or another designated member of the development team. For some larger organizations, appointing a member of a communications team can ensure alignment with communication norms.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">The communication lead should ideally email the attendees during the same week as the executive sponsor’s announcement. Quickly emailing attendees can prevent any concerns from metastasizing. This email should succinctly convey key facts. Though it shouldn’t attempt to answer every possible question from participants, it should direct them to someone who can address any concerns.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">The following is a sample email constructed for an organization that has never performed a tabletop exercise or whose attendees may have many questions:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p class="EXF"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Happy Friday!</span></p>&#13;
<p class="EX"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">During the quarterly all-hands meeting, Jamie Winter announced an initiative that our company has been working on for the past several weeks. Next month, we will be performing our very first cybersecurity tabletop exercise.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="EX"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Our Executive Team has requested that a tabletop exercise be performed due to our recent alignment with the Payment Card Industry standards. Plus, this exercise will help gauge the company’s readiness for a cybersecurity incident, identify any gaps in our response, and provide an opportunity for us to collaborate across teams while responding to a simulated incident.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="EX"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">Our tabletop exercise will be taking place on April 3 between 10:30</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_SC_11">AM</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">and 1:30</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_SC_11">PM</span><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">. It will occur at our 318 Smith St. location, in the Evergreen Conference Room. Lunch will be provided.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="EX"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">If you’re receiving this email, it means that your participation is requested in the tabletop exercise. If you are unable to attend due to preexisting obligations, please plan on having a delegate attend in your place. No preparation or prereading is required.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="EX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_43" aria-label="43"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">The tabletop will not be a test of any one individual’s or team’s ability to respond. This is an opportunity to collaborate and improve.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="EX"><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">The tabletop exercise Development Team (myself, Michael Murray, Diana Spinelli, and Jay Bell) recognizes that this may be a new experience for some. We’re available to answer any questions you may have and will also set up an optional discussion session on March 20 at 10</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_SC_11">AM</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">and again on March 22 at 4</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_SC_11">PM</span> <span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_11">in the Evergreen Conference Room.

</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="TX">This email is friendly, references support from the executive sponsor (Jamie Winter), provides assurance that the tabletop exercise is not an intensive event, and offers opportunities for participants to pose questions either in a group setting or directly to the development lead.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec37"><span id="h-52"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Calendar Invitations</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Immediately after sending the notification email, the communications lead should send calendar invitations to each invitee. This calendar invitation should, at a minimum, contain:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">The text from the initial email notification</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Logistical information, such as the timing and location</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Language helping the recipient distinguish between any discussion sessions and the actual tabletop exercise</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">Sending calendar invitations also provides an initial opportunity to identify any scheduling conflicts. If an attendee declines an invitation, the development team can make adjustments. Determine whether all parties have actually accepted the calendar invitations, and if they haven’t, reach out via phone or email.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Also block out time on the calendars of any stakeholders for a debrief immediately following the tabletop exercise. If several key participants have to run to their next meeting right after a two-hour tabletop exercise, the evaluation phase will be impaired. We discuss the evaluation phase in <span class="Xref1"><a href="chapter5.xhtml">Chapter 5</a></span>.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec38"><span id="h-53"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">The Discussion Session</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">The optional discussion session is an opportunity for attendees to ask questions before the tabletop exercise occurs. You can treat these sessions like a professor’s office hours; attendees or other interested stakeholders can casually raise lingering concerns. The development lead and possibly additional members from the development team should plan on joining, and you should try to offer at least two sessions to account for conflicts.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_44" aria-label="44"/>In addition to helping ease attendee concerns, discussion sessions allow the exercise facilitator to bond with attendees prior to the tabletop exercise. Simply shaking hands, chatting about activities for the upcoming weekend, or knowing that a particular attendee is a new aunt provides valuable conversation fodder for the day of the tabletop exercise.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Finally, these discussions can surface common themes that the development team or executive sponsor might need to address. For example, if several attendees tell you, “We heard this exercise will be used to justify outsourcing more of the information security team,” you can quickly address that concern before the exercise begins.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec39">&#13;
<h4 class="H2" id="sec39"><span id="h-54"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Informal Touchpoints</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">In addition to structured interactions such as the discussion sessions, the development team and executive sponsor can try to create informal touchpoints with attendees. Think of these as watercooler moments, those impromptu gatherings where employees discuss topics ranging from sports to the latest office news. If the opportunity arises, the development team members and executive sponsor can casually ask individual attendees how they feel about the upcoming exercise. It’s during these informal interactions that employees may be most likely to reveal underlying concerns.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">For example, an informal touchpoint with a tabletop participant in the office breakroom could reveal that they are worried about the exercise’s time commitment or fear looking foolish as a new employee. While these comments may seem trivial, investing the time to allay these concerns will yield a better tabletop exercise.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Finally, it’s important that the members of the development team and the executive sponsor continually share these concerns with each other. If all members of the development team hear the same concern from different sources, it’s an indication that they need to provide additional clarification on a certain topic.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="H2" id="sec40"><span id="h-55"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">The Final Reminder</span></h4>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Approximately three business days before the event, send a reminder to all tabletop attendees. This reminder gives you one last chance to change the scenario if someone in an important role is unable to attend. For example, if your scenario focuses on the legal obligations of an organization that loses employee data and the legal representative has a family emergency, you may need to quickly alter the scenario or reschedule the exercise altogether.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Alternatively, you could use the absence of a key participant as an opportunity to provide nuance to the scenario. Decision-makers will be forced to adjust on the fly to the participant’s absence—a circumstance that could certainly arise during a real-world event. This option is appropriate for tabletop exercises that aim to stress-test existing processes or discover single sources of failure, a common issue in responding to cybersecurity incidents. If the remaining participants all defer to the missing <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_45" aria-label="45"/>representative from legal, the development team has just discovered their first (and very important) recommendation.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec41"><span id="h-56"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Scenario Confidentiality</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">While it’s fine for members of the organization to know that a tabletop exercise is on the horizon, it’s important to maintain a degree of confidentiality about the scenario, goals, and objectives. Some participants may be nervous and ask to know about the scenario ahead of time. However, the confidentiality of the scenario is critical to the success of the tabletop exercise for several reasons.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">First, during an actual incident, parties involved in the response will be immersed in the “fog of war”; they won’t immediately be sure of the incident’s impact on the organization, how the organization was attacked, and other factors. Tabletop exercises should be no different. Not releasing details prior to the exercise will leave participants surprised by the scenario as it unfolds and require them to make quick decisions, as they would during an incident.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Secondly, if participants know the details of the exercise, they tend to arrive with scripted replies to demonstrate they know the correct answer. One of the many reasons to perform a tabletop exercise is to have participants discuss the pros and cons of potential responses, recognize shortcomings in technology or organizational processes, and bring forward their particular interests. These discussions occur as participants collaborate, a process that is impaired when they’re allowed to know details ahead of time.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">When a senior-level invitee requests access to the tabletop exercise materials, it may not be easy to tell them, “No, sorry, you’re not entitled to this material.” But all is not lost—there are a few strategies to head off these requests:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Prior to the exercise, warn the executive sponsor that participants may ask to view the materials and have the executive sponsor agree that the materials shouldn’t be released in advance.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Consider developing a “rules of engagement” document agreed to by the executive sponsor and development team stating that the scenario won’t be provided in advance. Refer anyone requesting the materials to these rules of engagement.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Ask the executive sponsor to speak with the person making the request and advocate for keeping the tabletop exercise confidential. Often, the conversation may reveal other concerns (such as the risk of being embarrassed in front of peers).</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">When you start planning the exercise, meet with the stakeholders most likely to request the materials and discuss the rationale for not providing them in advance. Reinforce that the purpose of the tabletop exercise isn’t to find fault in any one individual but to collaborate.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_46" aria-label="46"/>Provide a few high-level details regarding the scenario that won’t compromise the entire narrative.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Reinforce that the intention of the tabletop is not to publicly flog a participant for not taking the proper steps.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">In some cases, your attempts to keep the scenario confidential will fail. If a determined chief executive officer, majority owner, or board member requests access to the materials, they can barrel over your executive sponsor. On the bright side, having an executive take an interest in the tabletop exercise is an opportunity to demonstrate that there isn’t anything to fear about it, and in the next event, you can make a special effort to get this person to buy into keeping the scenario confidential now that a relationship has been built.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec42"><span id="h-57"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Opposition from Invitees</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Some individuals might oppose the tabletop exercise, either actively (such as by criticizing the format, questioning its value, or offering other less-than-positive feedback) or passively (by avoiding meetings, not RSVPing, or simply not prioritizing the event, for example).</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Some of the common reasons for opposition include:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Fear that the tabletop exercise will reveal a particular team’s shortcomings</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">A concern that a tabletop exercise or its findings will significantly impact their workload</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">A preexisting interpersonal conflict that makes it uncomfortable for participants to work together</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">Regardless of the reasons for the opposition, the development team must identify early signs of it, such as individuals doing the following:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Openly citing reasons to not perform the tabletop exercise, such as “Now isn’t the time for a tabletop exercise when we have 20 other projects that are more important”</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Indicating displeasure nonverbally, such as crossing their arms or rolling their eyes</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Not engaging with basic requests, such as RSVPing to events or responding to email</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">Addressing opposition is the development team’s responsibility, but how they go about it depends on the situation. One or more of the following methods will generally suffice:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Ask the opposing party about their concerns and take the time to listen. Acknowledge and validate their feelings.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">If possible, offer to weave their concerns into the tabletop exercise. For example, if an individual is concerned that the organization’s disaster recovery procedures are inadequate and the time allotted to the <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_47" aria-label="47"/>exercise would be better spent discussing this issue, add this issue to the tabletop exercise focusing on this topic.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Acknowledge that the upcoming tabletop exercise may not confront the opposing party’s concerns, but offer to include the issue in future exercise scenarios.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">If the participant fears that the exercise may expose professional shortcomings and place their job in jeopardy, reassure them that the purpose isn’t to find fault and assign blame.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">Often, these conversations can occur over a cup of coffee or after a standing team meeting. However, if the individual’s opposition remains after you’ve made reasonable efforts to address it, ask the executive sponsor to intervene prior to the event. In rare cases, the team might need to remove an employee from the tabletop exercise. While this is a drastic measure, a participant actively opposing the tabletop during the actual event could throw the exercise into disarray.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec43"><span id="h-58"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Outsourcing Tabletop Exercises</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">As the complexity of the information technology landscape has grown, many organizations now outsource their cybersecurity needs to remote services such as vCISOs and SOCs. Tabletop exercises are just one of many cybersecurity activities that an organization can outsource to a trusted vendor.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Many organizations lack a large enough information security budget to bring in an external consultant, which can be costly. Tabletop exercises can range in price from $5,000 to $25,000 depending on the required planning, complexity, delivery mechanism, duration, reporting, and other factors. For some companies, the cost of bringing in an external party may be a nonstarter.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">On the other hand, some organizations lack the necessary resources or knowledge to plan, develop, and facilitate such an event. It’s quite possible that no staff member has ever participated in a tabletop exercise before, whether with their current employer or in a past career. By contrast, individual members of a consultancy firm may execute 30 or more tabletop exercises a year and have the know-how to navigate potential roadblocks or hurdles. As a compromise, some organizations hire an external facilitator but treat the development process as an opportunity to also cross-train an internal employee for the next exercise.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Consultancy firms also tend to have expertise in specific areas. For example, one consultancy firm may specialize in incident response and another in payment card industry compliance. These external vendors can answer questions such as “How are we doing compared to our peers?” An external vendor who is a veteran at facilitating a large number of tabletop exercises across numerous organizations and industry verticals provides invaluable knowledge.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">In some organizations, there is a culture of looking to outside experts for guidance. In these cases, the organization may be more inclined to act <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_48" aria-label="48"/>upon recommendations of an external vendor, even if employees have made similar suggestions in the past. Those employees can use this to their advantage by having the external consultant advocate for important changes. For example, if an information security director has asked to implement multifactor authentication and been rebuffed, an external consultant can weave this issue into a tabletop exercise and list it as an identified deficiency.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Lastly, the outsourced tabletop exercise could serve as a <i>third-party assessment</i> meant to provide an unbiased point of view. (To remove as much residual bias as possible, choose a consultancy with few or no business connections with the organization.) Third-party assessments are a powerful tool, as observations and recommendations are unlikely to be clouded by conflicting interests. Also, external stakeholders evaluating an organization’s information security posture may be suspicious of an internally conducted tabletop exercise that resulted in glowing reviews and few deficiencies. These third-party assessments are particularly salient to parties such as cyber insurance underwriters or auditors, who may even request copies of the documentation when assessing the risks of conducting business with the organization. Having proof of a tabletop exercise performed by a third party lends credibility to the report.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">However, if you choose to outsource an exercise to a vendor, make sure to find the proper fit with the consultant assigned to the exercise. If, for example, a premier US art museum hired an external vendor to perform a tabletop exercise, and during their first meeting, the consultant said, “You guys have a bunch of painted canvases made by starving artists, right?” In doing so, the consultant demonstrated a lack of appreciation for the artwork, which was immensely important to museum staff. A consultant should be able to fit seamlessly into the organization, quickly understand the rungs on the organizational ladder, and not prompt a collective facepalm from the group.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">If you’re using an outside consultant to avoid dedicating too many internal resources to a tabletop exercise, be sure to ask about the consultant’s development methodology, including how much time and what activities will be required of internal staff members. It’s unlikely that they’ll need to assemble the development team from the organization’s staff, but a good consultant should solicit feedback from employees to ensure that the scenario they’re developing is pertinent and meets the exercise’s goals and objectives. If an outside consultant requires several hours of the organization’s time to brainstorm scenarios, review deliverables, assist with revisions, and so on, the relationship may not realize the intended value, but someone showing up with a canned scenario that has nothing to do with the organization or its business may be even worse.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H1" id="sec45"><span id="h-60"/><span class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Questions</span></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Most tabletop exercises require significant planning to be successful, so it’s worth investing time and effort in the planning process. Start your tabletop development process on the right track by considering the following questions:</p>&#13;
<ol class="NL">&#13;
<li class="NL" value="1">Who should be the tabletop exercise’s executive sponsor? What important traits do they possess? Does this person exist at the right spot in the organizational chart?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">What do you expect of your executive sponsor? Is the executive sponsor willing to perform these tasks?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">What are your goals and objectives in performing the tabletop exercise?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">Is this a senior-level or operational-level exercise?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">Do you plan to perform a tandem tabletop exercise? If so, do you have the time to devote to additional planning and facilitation tasks?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">Who must attend the tabletop exercise? Whose attendance is optional?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">Who will perform the roles of development lead, facilitator, subject matter expert, and trusted agent?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">Will the tabletop exercise be remote or in-person? If it’s remote, what technology will you require for your event to succeed? If it’s in-person, what logistical components should you consider?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">How long will your tabletop exercise be?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">How will you communicate about the event to attendees? Who will be responsible for this communication?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">How will you allow attendees to ask questions? If you schedule discussion sessions, who will attend these sessions?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">Do you anticipate any opposition to the tabletop exercise? If so, what is your plan to address it?</li>&#13;
<li class="NL">How will you maintain the confidentiality of the scenario?</li>&#13;

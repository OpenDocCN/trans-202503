<p class="noindent">In this chapter, we’ll explore a Twine game I made called <em>Interview with a Cat!</em> To create this game, I asked my cat Encyclopedia Frown a bunch of questions, and then wrote down all of her responses. She’s a very talkative kitty, and she had a lot to say!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_2"/><em>Interview with a Cat!</em> is a simple game in which you choose a question, Encyclopedia Frown answers it, and then you choose another question. Which question you ask next depends on Encyclopedia Frown’s response to the previous question, just like in a normal conversation. For example, if she mentions her mom—that’s me!—you can ask her about her mom. You’ll also see pictures of my cat in this game. Sometimes she makes funny faces when you ask her certain questions. Play the game now at <a href="https://nostarch.com/twinegames/"><em>https://nostarch.com/twinegames/</em></a>, and then come back when you’re done.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev12">Getting Started with Twine</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Twine games are made up of words, hyperlinks, and sometimes pictures. Of course, they’re not all about cats. There’s no <em>official</em> rule that says they have to be. For your first game, it’s best to start with a small idea. The reason is that big ideas grow like towering castles: they’re beautiful, but rarely do they get finished.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f026-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_3"/>Decide on an idea. It doesn’t have to be the best one. You’ll always have more ideas, and you can always make more Twine games, so don’t worry about the game being perfect. When you have a seed of an idea, navigate to Twine’s home page at <a href="http://www.twinery.org/"><em>http://www.twinery.org/</em></a>. The Twine web page looks like a big pinboard with lots of little notes pinned to it.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f027-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">For now, we’ll use Twine online so no setup is needed, and there’s nothing to install:</p>&#13;
<ol class="numlist">&#13;
<li class="noindent"><span class="listnum">1</span>Click <strong>Use it Online</strong>. You might see some helpful messages about Twine and some links to more information about using it. When you’ve finished reading those messages, you’ll end up in your personal Twine library, like the one shown in the following figure. You should see a big, empty white page because you haven’t written anything yet. Soon this page will be filled with all your stories!<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_4"/>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f028-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent"><span class="listnum">2</span>Click the <strong>+Story</strong> button. A window should pop up and ask you to name your story. For example, if you’re writing about an interview with your cat Marshmallow, enter something like <em>The Marshmallow Interview</em> or <em>Marshmallow: The Interview</em>. If you want to write about an interview with your fish, your dog, an imaginary alien, or something else, write that! If you can’t think of any ideas, just copy my game for now. You can always change it later.&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f028-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_5"/><span class="listnum">3</span>After you’ve entered a name, click <strong>+Add</strong>. You should see a blue screen like this.&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f029-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p class="indent">This is where your story will be! Right now, it’s just an empty grid waiting for all your cool ideas.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev13">Editing Passages</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Think of the big blue grid like the blueprint for a house (or a castle, or an underwater laboratory, or a giant mechanical dinosaur—whatever you want). You’ll add passages to this grid. A <em>passage</em> is a piece of text, but you can also think of it as a single page in your story or a single room in your blueprint.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Right now, there’s only one passage, which is called <em>Untitled Passage</em> because you haven’t named it yet. Double-click where it says <em>Double-click this passage to edit it</em>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_6"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f030-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>The first passage in your new Twine story</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A window opens that lets you enter text. Change the name of the passage by highlighting <em>Untitled Passage</em> and pressing the <span class="smallcaps">BACKSPACE</span> key to delete it.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Name this first passage <strong>Start</strong> because it’s where the player will start.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong>NOTE</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep">It’s best to give your passages meaningful names that are easy to remember!</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Next, write the text the player will see in your game! Highlight the existing <em>Double-click this passage to edit it.</em> message and press <span class="smallcaps">BACKSPACE</span> to delete it. Then a whole bunch of ghostly text will appear in the window!</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f030-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Ghostly reminder text reminds you what to write</em></p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_7"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f031-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">This ghost text just reminds you how Twine works. It vanishes as soon as you start entering text. Enter the first word of my <em>Interview with a Cat!</em> game, which is <code>meh!</code></p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f031-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Creating links</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The words in blue under <code>Meh!</code> make up a <em>link</em>, which the player clicks to go from passage to passage. Let’s walk through the parts of the following link:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs1"><span class="programblue">[[What does "meh" mean?-&gt;Meh]]</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_8"/>It’s important to use two brackets, <code>[[</code> <code>]]</code>, on either side of the text to enclose the link. This lets Twine know that the text inside the brackets is a link and everything outside isn’t. If you’re not careful, you could end up selecting an entire screen as a link instead of just a few words.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The words before the arrow (<code>What does "meh" mean?</code>) are the only part the player will see. Refer back to the first figure in this chapter to see what this link looks like in a finished game. When the player clicks those words, they’ll go somewhere new! But where?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">That’s the arrow’s (<code>-&gt;</code>) job. It’s made of a dash (<code>-</code>) and a greater than sign (<code>&gt;</code>). The arrow connects the words in the link to the link’s destination.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The third item is the link’s destination. In this case, <code>-&gt;Meh</code> means the link goes to a passage called <em>Meh</em> where Encyclopedia Frown explains what “meh” means.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong>NOTE</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep">From left to right, a link has the following format:<br/><span class="literalbox">[[text to display in link</span><span class="literalbox">-&gt;</span><span class="literalbox">link destination]]</span></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can make your link the first question the player might ask your cat, dog, or alien monster. Enter what the player will see first, an arrow <code>-&gt;</code>, and then the name of the passage to link to (where the player goes). Finally, enclose everything with closing double brackets. When you’re done, click the X in the top-right corner of the window to close it.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f032-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">A new room should be added to your blueprint, and your screen should look something like what’s shown at right.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Whenever you add links to passages, like we just did with <em>Meh</em>, Twine automatically creates those new passages for you to fill in and then saves your work.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_9"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f033-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">It’s best to finish writing a passage before you start filling in the new passages your links create. Let’s add two more links to the <em>Start</em> passage, like this:</p>&#13;
<pre>Meh!<br/><span class="programblue">[[Hello!-&gt;Hello]]</span><br/><span class="programblue">[[Merrow!-&gt;Cattalk]]</span><br/><span class="programblue">[[What does "meh" mean?-&gt;Meh]]</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Close the window and presto!</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f033-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_10"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f034-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">By adding links to different passages like this, you create new choices the player can explore when they play the game.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev14">Creating Multiple Paths</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Players of the <em>Interview with a Cat!</em> game can reach the same passages in multiple ways. For example, the first passage has three choices: <em>Hello</em>, <em>Meh</em>, and <em>Cattalk</em>. Each passage leads players to a different passage. But all three will eventually take the player to the same place: a main <em>Interview</em> passage with lots of different questions. This is the center of the story and is similar to a table of contents. Like a table of contents, it shows many different places the story can go, and you can always return to it to go somewhere else.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_11"/>In the following figure, arrows point from the <em>Start</em> passage to lots of other passages, showing different links the player can click.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f035-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">All the links lead to the <em>Interview</em> passage eventually, and so do a lot of arrows from other passages on other parts of the blueprint! As a result, the player can choose one option without being afraid that they’ll miss another part of the story.</p>&#13;
<div class="boxbgpink">&#13;
<p class="boxhead"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_12"/>Secrets and Rewards!</p>&#13;
<p class="boxnoindent">You can use little prizes to motivate the player to explore your story thoroughly. For example, I use special pictures of Encyclopedia Frown in <em>Interview with a Cat!</em> as rewards for finding certain passages. In the game is a very cute photo of Encyclopedia making a face that looks like this: O_o. This photo appears in only one passage in the entire game. Did you find it? To see this photo, you have to ask Encyclopedia “one more question” and then say something that’s not a question!</p>&#13;
<p class="boxindent">One cool thing about writing interactive stories is that every player’s path through the game will be a little different. Try filling your games with lots of neat secrets for players to find and share with each other.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev15">Deleting Passages</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">When you drag your mouse over any passage, you should see a bubble with four icons that look like a trash can, a pencil, a play button, and three dots. Let’s explore what these do.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f036-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_13"/>You can use the <em>trash can</em> to delete the passage, erasing it from your story <em>forever!</em> (When you click it, a warning message appears to prevent you from deleting text by accident.) The <em>pencil</em> lets you edit the passage: you can also edit it by double-clicking on the passage.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f037-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev16">Testing Your Game</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">To make sure your links work the way you want them to, you can test them. The <em>play button</em> lets you test your game, beginning with the passage the bubble is pointing at. When you click it, you enter <strong>Debug View</strong>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">People call problems in their games <em>bugs</em>. Think of a mean little bug crawling around inside your computer pressing all the wrong buttons and messing up everything. Yuck! A bug might be that you directed a link to the wrong place or made some other error. The only way to find the bugs in your games and get rid of them is to test your game. It’s a good idea to test your game every so often, just to make sure everything works correctly.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_14"/>Hover your mouse over the <em>Start</em> passage and click the play button. A screen appears that looks like this.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f038-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f038-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_15"/>Now you can do a test run of your game. When you click your links in Debug Mode, you’ll see an option to fix errors by clicking <em>Double-click this passage to edit it</em>. You should also see a small back arrow on the left.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f039-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Click the back arrow to return to the previous passage and make a different choice.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Click the back arrow to go back and make a different choice so you can test different paths. (The <strong>Debug View</strong> button in the corner shows additional information about your links that players won’t see, such as which passage each link goes to.) When you’ve checked that all your links work, close the browser tab to return to Twine.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev17">Setting the Start Passage</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In the <em>Start</em> passage, you’ll see a small, green rocket ship icon, which means it’s the first page. To start at another passage, click “More passage options” on the bar and then click “Start Story Here” in the drop-down menu to make that passage the starting passage. The green rocket ship icon should appear on the new Start passage.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Click the <strong>Play</strong> button in the lower-right corner of Twine. Your game should start at the passage with the green rocket ship. Now you’re playing the game the way a player would see it.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev18">Sharing Your Twine Game</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">When you’ve finished creating your Twine game, share it with your friends and put it online, just like a game developer would do. Rad!</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_16"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f040-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Follow these steps to share your game:</p>&#13;
<ol class="numlist">&#13;
<li class="noindent"><span class="listnum">1</span>Click the name of your game on the bottom of Twine’s grid screen. A menu of options pops up.&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f040-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent"><span class="listnum">2</span>Click <strong>Publish to File</strong>. If your browser asks, click <strong>Save File</strong> to save your game to your computer as an HTML file, which is essentially <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_17"/>a web page. Your game should be in the <em>Downloads</em> folder on your machine or wherever you save downloaded files from your web browser. It’ll be named something like <em>interview-with-a-cat.html.</em></li>&#13;
<li class="noindent"><span class="listnum">3</span>To share your game with someone else, just email the HTML file to them. When they receive the file, they need to open it in their web browser to play the game.</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p class="indent">When your game is ready for prime time, you can upload it to the internet so anyone can play it. A few sites on the internet allow you to upload your game for free.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev19">Uploading Your Game Online</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The free Twine hosting site <a href="http://philome.la"><em>http://philome.la</em></a> is one option for your game. It’s very easy to use, but you must have a Twitter account to upload your HTML file.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f041-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Another option is <a href="http://textadventures.co.uk"><em>http://textadventures.co.uk</em></a>. You don’t need a Twitter account, but you’ll need to register for an account at the site.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_18"/>Still another option is <a href="https://neocities.org"><em>https://neocities.org</em></a>. Setting it up is a bit more work than on the other sites, but you can get a cool website for your game with an easy-to-remember URL. Just register a website there, such as <!-- <a href="http://my-cool-game.neocities.org"> --><em>my-cool-game.neocities.org</em><!-- </a> --> (or whatever cool name is available), and upload your HTML file, like so:</p>&#13;
<ol class="numlist">&#13;
<li class="noindent"><span class="listnum">1</span>Find your file on your computer. Its name should be something like &lt;<em>Your-Game&gt;.html</em>. Rename it <em>index.html</em>.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent"><span class="listnum">2</span>Fill out the information on the front page of the website, and click <strong>Register</strong>.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent"><span class="listnum">3</span>Click <strong>Edit Site</strong>, which takes you to a new page.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent"><span class="listnum">4</span>Click <strong>Upload</strong>. A window appears to help you select the file to upload. Choose your <em>index.html</em> file and click <strong>Open</strong>.</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now your game should be on the internet! Visit your brand-new website and make sure your game works.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev20">What You Learned</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Good work! Now you know the basics of using Twine. You can write passages and create links to give your player choices. You know how to test your game to make sure it’s working. And you know how to export your game, share it with other people, and put it online.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">But there’s so much more you can do with Twine! In the next chapter, you’ll learn some fun tricks to make your Twine games more expressive. You’ll also use links in different ways to shape the feeling and flow of your stories. See you there!</p>&#13;

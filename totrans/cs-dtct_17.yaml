    Frank tried to stand, but his left foot protested with a burst of pain. He settled
    for scooting around on his butt until he faced her.

    “It’s hard to find an evil wizard these days. I hear their last wizard is selling
    coconuts now.”

    commercially viable neutrality. However, it is not impossible to find help. Let’s
    just say the Vinettees were able to make a suitable arrangement. They have found
    a wizard who is willing to provide certain magical assistance in exchange for
    their services in other areas.”

    it comes to binary search tree traps. She was a true artist. But his work is sufficient.

    is 26\. We obviously didn’t want him changing too many ladders—just enough to
    trap anyone who tried to reuse an old password. So close.”

    sideline him, and the spy had to know this. Which meant that she planned to either
    kill him or keep him captive. While neither option appealed to Frank, he always
    preferred the one that didn’t involved getting killed.

    ladder trap would do the job, but no. Not yet, at least.” She walked over to another
    ladder just past 26 and struck a rung with the palm of her hand. A dull gonging
    sound filled the room. Then she struck again twice more. *Gong*. *Gong*.

    she strode from the room.

- en: Confused, Frank watched her go. Then movement out of the corner of his eye caught
    his attention. As he watched, three rungs detached themselves and dropped to the
    floor. After a moment, they started wriggling toward him, hissing quietly. Snake
    rungs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Frank moved quickly. The snake rungs were dangerous but slow. If he could make
    it to ladder 26, he still had a chance. He crawled on his hands and knees, not
    trusting his foot yet. He used the ladder to pull himself to his feet and leaned
    heavily against the metal. There was no doubt about it, this climb was going to
    hurt.
  prefs: []

    It was more of a hop than a climb; he had to jump off his good foot and pull himself
    to the next rung. His left foot throbbed with each movement.

- en: Frank hauled himself up to the top and collapsed onto platform 25, lying back
    to catch his breath and curse binary search ladders. To think that he had once
    thought these structures beautiful, elegant even. He had been to several of Alena’s
    exhibits during his police academy days and had even attended the world’s one
    and only instance of binary search tree performance art.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The exhibit had been called *Raise the Pears*. Alena had contracted three wizards
    to magically raise a binary search ladder in real time, organizing a collection
    of paintings by the number of pears they depicted. Pear-centric still life had
    been a craze that year, a phenomenon later blamed on the poor quality of the apple
    crop. While not as embarrassing as the following year’s obsession with toast sculptures,
    the pear craze is still only ever discussed in art history classes, and even there
    only in hushed tones, with the appropriate expression of disgust.

- en: Seven assistants, each carrying a crude painting containing pears, had paraded
    into the gallery. They stood in sorted order from 1 to 23 pears, the paintings
    held in front of their faces to hide their shame at the absurd spectacle.

    element. The painting depicted eight pears and a cup of milk on a wooden table.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Tree root ascend,” the wizard shouted. Immediately the line of paintings split
    into three groups. On the left were the paintings with fewer than eight pears.
    On the right were the paintings with more than eight pears. And floating above
    them was the new root of the binary search tree. He had made the first branch.

- en: After that, the other two wizards recursively divided the paintings on each
    side, first left and then right. The process was always the same. The wizard selected
    the middle element and partitioned the paintings based on that element. As they
    worked, the tree rose into the air and branched out below the root node.

    form of the data structure, Frank found the whole concept rather idiotic. He wondered
    how he could have ever thought the recursive division of paintings was beautiful.

- en: The sound of hissing brought Frank back to the moment. The end of a snake rung
    poked up onto the platform and swiveled around, searching for Frank. Given that
    it was little more than an animated piece of metal, Frank wasn’t exactly sure
    how the snake rung searched. It didn’t have any eyes, nose, or mouth. Maybe it
    sensed vibrations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He considered kicking the snake rung down, but decided against it. Snake rungs
    were inexplicably poisonous, considering their lack of a mouth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead, Frank decided to continue his retreat. He scooted over to the upward
    ladder and hoisted himself into a standing position. The pain in his ankle had
    subsided enough to make the next climb more of a traditional ladder experience
    and less a frantic hopping motion.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Frank continued directly up the next level, returning to the top root-node platform
    with the little brass tag reading 50.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He paused to mutter yet another curse against binary search ladders. They were,
    as he saw it now, quite stupid contraptions. Despite not having any actual reasoning
    behind it, Frank felt confident in his assessment. With a satisfied nod, he pulled
    himself back onto the street and away from the snake rungs.

- en: You can create binary search trees from a sorted array by recursively dividing
    the elements into smaller subsets. At each level, the middle value is chosen as
    the node at that level. If there is an even number of elements, you can use either
    of the two middle elements.

    independently split in the same way. Conceptually, we split the sorted array into
    left and right arrays and apply the same algorithm on each of those arrays.

    a wizard who is willing to provide certain magical assistance in exchange for

    sideline him, and the spy had to know this. Which meant that she planned to either
    kill him or keep him captive. While neither option appealed to Frank, he always
    preferred the one that didn’t involved getting killed.

    ladder trap would do the job, but no. Not yet, at least.” She walked over to another
    ladder just past 26 and struck a rung with the palm of her hand. A dull gonging
    sound filled the room. Then she struck again twice more. *Gong*. *Gong*.

    his attention. As he watched, three rungs detached themselves and dropped to the
    floor. After a moment, they started wriggling toward him, hissing quietly. Snake
    rungs.
  id: totrans-19

    it to ladder 26, he still had a chance. He crawled on his hands and knees, not
    trusting his foot yet. He used the ladder to pull himself to his feet and leaned
    heavily against the metal. There was no doubt about it, this climb was going to
    hurt.

    to catch his breath and curse binary search ladders. To think that he had once
    thought these structures beautiful, elegant even. He had been to several of Alena’s
    exhibits during his police academy days and had even attended the world’s one
    and only instance of binary search tree performance art.
  id: totrans-23

- en: The exhibit had been called *Raise the Pears*. Alena had contracted three wizards
    to magically raise a binary search ladder in real time, organizing a collection
    of paintings by the number of pears they depicted. Pear-centric still life had
    been a craze that year, a phenomenon later blamed on the poor quality of the apple
    crop. While not as embarrassing as the following year’s obsession with toast sculptures,
    the pear craze is still only ever discussed in art history classes, and even there
    only in hushed tones, with the appropriate expression of disgust.

    into the gallery. They stood in sorted order from 1 to 23 pears, the paintings
    held in front of their faces to hide their shame at the absurd spectacle.

    into three groups. On the left were the paintings with fewer than eight pears.
    On the right were the paintings with more than eight pears. And floating above
    them was the new root of the binary search tree. He had made the first branch.

    side, first left and then right. The process was always the same. The wizard selected
    the middle element and partitioned the paintings based on that element. As they
    worked, the tree rose into the air and branched out below the root node.

    poked up onto the platform and swiveled around, searching for Frank. Given that
    it was little more than an animated piece of metal, Frank wasn’t exactly sure
    how the snake rung searched. It didn’t have any eyes, nose, or mouth. Maybe it
    sensed vibrations.

    ladder and hoisted himself into a standing position. The pain in his ankle had
    subsided enough to make the next climb more of a traditional ladder experience
    and less a frantic hopping motion.

    as he saw it now, quite stupid contraptions. Despite not having any actual reasoning
    behind it, Frank felt confident in his assessment. With a satisfied nod, he pulled
    himself back onto the street and away from the snake rungs.

    the elements into smaller subsets. At each level, the middle value is chosen as
    the node at that level. If there is an even number of elements, you can use either
    of the two middle elements.

    infiltration technique called “the art of a worm in your stomach” (or “worm agent”),
    which calls for shinobi to recruit enemy insiders to perform tasks on their behalf.
    Such recruitment took high emotional intelligence. Shinobi had to choose an appropriate
    target; engineer opportunities to approach the target; and discreetly parse what
    the target thought about their employer, personal worth, and secret ambitions.^([2](b01.xhtml#endnote-89))
    The scroll warns that candidate selection must be undertaken with extreme care,
    because attempting to recruit the wrong person to become a worm agent—or *minomushi*—could
    seriously harm a shinobi’s mission. To maximize their odds of successful recruitment,
    shinobi developed eight archetypes of likely worm agents:^([3](b01.xhtml#endnote-90))

- en: An *insider threat* is an employee, user, or other internal resource whose actions
    could harm an organization—whether intentionally or not. Because they did not
    intend to perform malicious actions, a hapless employee who opens a phishing email
    and infects their workstation with malware is an unwitting insider threat. On
    the other hand, a disgruntled worker who purposefully releases a virus into the
    organization, whether for personal reasons or on behalf of an adversary, is an
    intentional insider threat. Because insider threats are legitimate, authorized
    users with authentication, privileges, and access to information systems and data,
    they are some of cybersecurity’s most difficult problems to mitigate.

    organizations. By checking references; performing background checks, including
    of criminal and financial history; and screening for drug use, the employer can
    verify that employees are not plainly vulnerable to undue influence. The human
    resources function plays a key role in identifying potential insider threats.
    Some human resources departments conduct annual employee surveys to identify potential
    issues, and others terminate at-risk employees proactively or recommend rescinding
    certain access privileges based on troublesome findings. Unfortunately, it is
    common for organizations to exercise minimal precautions. Most trust their employees,

    infiltration technique called “the art of a worm in your stomach” (or “worm agent”),
    which calls for shinobi to recruit enemy insiders to perform tasks on their behalf.
    Such recruitment took high emotional intelligence. Shinobi had to choose an appropriate
    target; engineer opportunities to approach the target; and discreetly parse what
    the target thought about their employer, personal worth, and secret ambitions.^([2](b01.xhtml#endnote-89))
    The scroll warns that candidate selection must be undertaken with extreme care,
    because attempting to recruit the wrong person to become a worm agent—or *minomushi*—could
    seriously harm a shinobi’s mission. To maximize their odds of successful recruitment,
    shinobi developed eight archetypes of likely worm agents:^([3](b01.xhtml#endnote-90))

- en: An *insider threat* is an employee, user, or other internal resource whose actions
    could harm an organization—whether intentionally or not. Because they did not
    intend to perform malicious actions, a hapless employee who opens a phishing email
    and infects their workstation with malware is an unwitting insider threat. On
    the other hand, a disgruntled worker who purposefully releases a virus into the
    organization, whether for personal reasons or on behalf of an adversary, is an
    intentional insider threat. Because insider threats are legitimate, authorized
    users with authentication, privileges, and access to information systems and data,
    they are some of cybersecurity’s most difficult problems to mitigate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many organizations rely on technical controls and threat hunters for early detection
    of insider threats. Technical detection techniques—things like behavior heuristics—can
    help identify potential insider threats. Vigilant cyberdefenders and hunters may
    investigate users who take uncharacteristic or inappropriate actions, including
    downloading all files to external portable media, performing searches for sensitive
    or proprietary data unrelated to their job, logging in to perform nonpriority
    work on weekends or holidays, accessing honeypot systems and files clearly labeled
    as restricted access, or downloading and using hacker-like tools to perform actions
    outside their job functions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But technical controls are only part of a solid defense strategy, even for mature
    organizations. By checking references; performing background checks, including
    of criminal and financial history; and screening for drug use, the employer can
    verify that employees are not plainly vulnerable to undue influence. The human
    resources function plays a key role in identifying potential insider threats.
    Some human resources departments conduct annual employee surveys to identify potential
    issues, and others terminate at-risk employees proactively or recommend rescinding
    certain access privileges based on troublesome findings. Unfortunately, it is
    common for organizations to exercise minimal precautions. Most trust their employees,
    others ignore the issue, and still others accept the risk of insider threats so
    business operations can run smoothly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Entities that fight insider threats more aggressively, such as organizations
    in the defense industry and the intelligence community, implement advanced detection
    and prevention measures such as polygraphs, routine clearance checks, counterintelligence
    programs, compartmentalization, and severe legal penalties—not to mention cutting-edge
    technical controls. However, even these controls cannot guarantee that the malicious
    actions of all insider threats—especially those assisted by sophisticated adversaries—will
    be detected and prevented. They also present unique implementation and operational
    challenges.

    threats. Then train, warn, and mitigate these individuals by implementing additional

    the eight insider threat candidate archetypes and discussed the various types

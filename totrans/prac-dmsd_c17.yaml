    an author weaves a tale of a lone survivor traversing the pristine wilderness.
    But during a water outage in an urban high-rise, you might end up with a pressing
    problem in the blink of an eye. Many other household tasks, such as doing laundry
    or bathing, also get complicated when the taps are dry—and especially for families

- en: Although ubiquitous indoor plumbing is a fairly recent development, sustainable
    methods of sanitary waste disposal have been with us for thousands of years. The
    solutions varied in complexity and elegance, ranging from regularly emptied communal
    cesspits to the sophisticated sewer systems of the ancient Greeks—but whatever
    the method, almost every permanent human settlement went to considerable lengths
    to keep the problem in check. Even in medieval Europe, the situation wasn’t nearly
    as dire as commonly portrayed in fiction. Some cities occasionally experienced
    issues, but the popular tropes of grime-covered peasants and human excrement piling
    up in the streets are more a matter of artistic license than of demonstrable fact.^([1](b02.xhtml#c17-endnote-1))

- en: Today, municipal sewers and flush toilets do away with all the ickiness of storing
    or treating waste in the vicinity of our homes. On the flip side, our reliance
    on such technologies means that if the water stops flowing, we find ourselves
    not in the shoes of mid-19th century Londoners, but in a far more perilous spot.
    Of course, small-scale disasters pose little concern. If only a block or two are
    affected by a water outage, it’s easy to swing by a nearby gas station or rent
    a porta-potty for a couple of days. But during large-scale crises, the options
    aren’t clear-cut—and while rural families with septic tanks may have little to
    worry about, many suburbanites and city dwellers may be forced to take decidedly
    unsanitary steps.

- en: In principle, a water outage needn’t stop you from using your toilet. You can
    manually refill a freestanding unit by removing the top cover of the tank, and
    even in systems with the tank built into the wall, flushing can be achieved with
    less precision but good results by rapidly dumping two to three gallons of water
    into the bowl. That said, the sheer amount of water needed to keep a toilet working
    is a significant issue for most families, except—as noted in Chapter 15—for those
    with backyard pools or ponds. Collecting and using rainwater can be an option,
    but only in some climates and in certain months of the year. Another possible
    solution is to recycle household gray water. Ignoring the slight yuck factor,
    the toilet tank can be refilled with whatever’s left after cooking, dishwashing,
    or doing the laundry.

- en: Still, even with these creative water-use methods, most households simply won’t
    have enough water to regularly operate their toilets in the long haul. What’s
    more, your own efforts won’t necessarily forestall the possibility of issues arising
    downstream. Although municipal sewers rely chiefly on gravity, pumps—known as
    *lift stations*—must be added every now and then to help navigate terrain. Many
    lift stations have backup power, but typically just for a couple of hours. Once
    the fuel runs out, nearby customers may experience difficulties flushing, or even
    see sewage flowing back into their homes—especially during the periods of heavy
    rain.^([*](#c17-footnote-1))

- en: When flushing the toilet is impractical or inadvisable, the simplest solution
    is bagging solid waste. The task can be accomplished by opening a trash bag, taping
    it to a toilet seat, and then closing the bag after use and discarding it in a
    curbside collection bin or other lidded container of sufficient size. In the winter,
    this method can be quite sustainable, but on hot summer days, it can quickly create
    a foul mess. In such a case, chemical treatment can help. Using a scoop of hydrated
    lime (calcium hydroxide), a common gardening supply, is a cost-effective solution
    that creates a highly alkaline environment inhospitable to microbes. Another route
    is to dehydrate the waste with bentonite-based kitty litter, thus preventing decay.
    If you choose one of these approaches, maintaining an ample supply of trash bags
    and treatment materials will be an important part of your plans.
  prefs: []

- en: If the outage continues for days or weeks, a more sustainable alternative is
    to start digging out a *pit latrine*—a deep hole with some sort of a cover, where
    you can dump waste and let it naturally decompose. A depth of at least five to
    six feet is preferable, and the pit should be placed far from any household wells
    or ponds. To mitigate odors, you can then regularly cover the contents with a
    layer of soil. The main challenge is just digging the pit in the first place;
    rocky or clay soils are formidable foes. In high-density apartment complexes,
    coordinating with neighbors would be crucial too; it doesn’t matter what *you*
    do if everybody else is resorting to stinky and unsanitary measures.

    oft-overlooked necessity in many preparedness plans. Having a carton set aside,
    and a roll or two packed with evacuation supplies, is almost always a good plan.
    The same goes for feminine hygiene products, diapers, kitty litter, and so forth—depending
    on your family’s specific needs.

    it’s not supposed to go. Whether it’s a faulty appliance, a damaged fixture, a
    leaky roof, or backed-up sewage, five-figure losses can mount in a matter of minutes
    if you don’t have a way to stop or divert the leak. During severe storms, groundwater
    and surface water can become a problem too. Drainage issues are so common that
    millions of homes in the United States are fitted with sump pumps permanently
    hooked up in the basement to keep the structure dry, but such a pump is of no

    expedient solution are long “socks” filled with naturally absorbent material or
    compact hydrogel that expands on contact with water; PIG Sock and Quick Dam are
    two well-known brands. The socks are usually around five feet long and can hold

    barriers that can be filled with water from a garden hose. One popular brand is
    HydraBarrier, with several models that can hold back anywhere from 4 to 12 inches

    while, but it pays to remember Murphy’s law and expect an untimely accident or
    two; this is especially true if you have kids or pets. The prepper community is
    obsessed with recipes for oddball DIY cleaning agents—often involving vinegar,
    hydrogen peroxide, or baking soda—but it’s simpler to have an extra bottle of
    your favorite surface cleaner squirreled away, along with some clean rags. Even
    when preparing for long-term emergencies, DIY cleaners are seldom a necessity.
    It’s better to look into concentrated products marketed to restaurants, hotels,
    or other commercial establishments. For example, a small bottle of Diversey PERdiem,

    as usual” and “back to the Stone Age,” and in many circumstances, you may still
    want to feel fresh. In the short term, the simplest approach may be just to have
    clean underwear in your emergency stash, but when laundry can no longer be avoided,
    undergarments can be soaked for a couple of hours in the sink with a small amount
    of water and detergent and agitated vigorously every now and then. The clothing
    can be then wrung out, rinsed, and hung to dry; with a bit of practice, it’s possible
    to make do with two to three gallons of water per batch. Regular dish soap can
    work just as well as a laundry detergent, but if you plan on storing laundry products,
    the longest shelf life can be expected of powdered formulations sold in plastic
    tubs. Popular brands to look for include Arm & Hammer and Charlie’s Soap.

    a wet rag plus a touch of soap to wipe down all the areas of concern. But this

    that cause bodily odors in the first place. Although there are limits to what’s
    possible, good antiperspirant can save the day. Products containing aluminum complexes—such
    as aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly—are hard to beat, so even if you prefer
    more natural-sounding formulations, it might be a compromise worth making in the
    time of need. Of course, because antiperspirant dries out skin and can be irritating,
    it shouldn’t be used on your intimate parts; benzalkonium chloride (BZK) wipes,
    available from companies such as Dynarex, are a better choice on that front. Such
    medicated wet wipes contain a substance that is both a detergent and a potent
    but gentle antiseptic, and work wonders when alternatives are out of reach.

    the most part no different from the ailments we experience on normal days. Many

    chronic health conditions, the first step of building an emergency healthcare
    plan is to ensure the uninterrupted supply of the necessary drugs. This should
    start with a frank conversation with your doctor—but because of the pop-cultural
    stigma of prepping, broaching the topic in a less inflammatory way may be useful.
    In rural places, it may be enough to discuss a previous incident of getting snowed
    in for a couple of weeks and express a desire to have a safety margin if the prescription

    be more difficult. Doctors are subject to strict regulations and often skeptical
    of the stories their patients tell, so success is unlikely unless the doctor knows
    you well. Perishable medications, such as insulin or epinephrine, pose some challenges
    too. They aren’t difficult to obtain but may need to be replenished fairly regularly,
    possibly at a nontrivial cost. Maintaining a first-in, first-out stockpile, as

    an OTC epinephrine inhaler available in the United States. Rehydration salts can

    cuts and other injuries, plenty of options are available, but it’s important to
    be realistic. Without practice, for instance, few of us would be able to properly
    suture wounds, so skin staplers and elastic bandages (such as 3M Vetrap) tend

    specific ailment, or the health risks of taking the wrong one, are often overstated
    too. Popular choices, such as amoxicillin, have broad-spectrum activity and are
    unlikely to cause serious harm (except to those with specific and generally well-understood
    allergies). In some parts of the world, the substances are available over the

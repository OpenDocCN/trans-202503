<div class="imagel"><img alt="Image" src="../images/common.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A computer network is a group of computers or other devices that are connected to facilitate the sharing of resources. You likely depend on a variety of networks to function daily. Networks control and enable modern automobiles, airplanes, medical devices, refrigerators, and countless other devices. Networks provide the ability for you to communicate, navigate road systems, go to school, play games, watch TV, and listen to music. Without a secure and stable system of networks, many of the daily conveniences that you enjoy would be made considerably more difficult to interact with or just fail to function entirely.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Your networks may face threats from attackers; they may also suffer from misconfigurations of their infrastructure or network-enabled devices, or even from simple outages. Most of the world is network dependent, so losing network connectivity and the services it provides can suffocate you. At worst, it can devastate your business.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_134"/>In January 2017, civil unrest in Cameroon reached a high point when large-scale protests erupted over the dominance of French in a country where both French and English are official languages. In what appears to have been an attempt to rein in the protestors, the government deliberately disconnected large, primarily English-speaking areas of the country from the global networks that comprise the internet. These regions remained offline for 93 days before the government restored access.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch10fn1" id="kch10fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> These types of outages can have wide-reaching impacts across industries, disrupting medical care, communications, employment, education, shopping, and many other aspects of people’s lives.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Although the situation in Cameroon may be an extreme example, smaller network outages and other malfunctions cause serious impacts all over the world every day. Some of these problems may result from technical issues. Others may result from the specific <em>distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks</em> (DoS attacks that originate from many distributed sources) I’ll discuss in this chapter, or from temporary causes entirely unknown to the network users.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This chapter will cover the infrastructure and devices you can put in place to secure your networks and the methods you can use to protect the network traffic itself. You’ll also learn about tools that can help verify your security.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch10lev1sec1">Protecting Networks</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You can use two methods to protect your networks and network resources. One option is to design your networks securely by laying them out so they’re resistant to attack or technical mishap. You can also implement a variety of devices, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, in and around your networks.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch10lev2sec1"><em>Designing Secure Networks</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">By designing your networks properly, you can prevent some attacks entirely, mitigate others, and, when you fail, fail in a graceful way.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">One strategy for reducing the impact of attacks is <em>network segmentation</em>. When you segment a network, you divide it into multiple smaller networks called <em>subnets</em>. You can control the flow of traffic between subnets, allowing or disallowing it based on a variety of factors or even blocking the flow of traffic entirely if necessary. Properly segmented networks can boost network performance by containing certain traffic to the portions of the network that need to see it, and they can help you localize technical network issues. Additionally, network segmentation can prevent unauthorized network traffic or attacks from reaching particularly sensitive portions of the network.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can also secure your networks by funneling traffic through <em>choke points</em>, or locations where you can inspect, filter, and control the traffic. The choke points might be the routers that move traffic from one subnet to another, the firewalls that filter traffic through your networks or portions of your networks, or the application proxies that filter the traffic for applications <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_135"/>such as web or email. I’ll discuss some of these devices at greater length in the next section of this chapter.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Creating redundancies when designing your networks can also help mitigate issues. Certain technical failures or attacks may render portions of your technology—including networks, network infrastructure devices, or border devices such as firewalls—unusable. For example, if one of your border devices is subjected to a DDoS attack, you can’t do much to stop it. You can, however, switch to a different internet connection or route traffic through a different device until you can come to a longer-term solution.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch10lev2sec2"><em>Using Firewalls</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A <em>firewall</em> is a mechanism for maintaining control over the traffic that flows in and out of networks. One of the first papers to discuss the idea was “Simple and Flexible Datagram Access Controls,” written in 1989 by Jeffrey Mogul,<a href="notes.xhtml#ch10fn2" id="kch10fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> then at Digital Equipment Corporation. In 1992, Digital Equipment Corporation created first commercial firewall, the DEC SEAL.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch10fn3" id="kch10fn3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You typically place firewalls at points where the level of trust changes, like the border between an internal network and the internet, as shown in <a href="#ch10fig1">Figure 10-1</a>. You may also install a firewall on your internal network to prevent unauthorized users from accessing network traffic of a sensitive nature.</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch10fig1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/10fig01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 10-1: Firewall placement</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Many of the firewalls in use today work by examining the <em>packets</em> (blocks of data) moving through the network to determine which ones it should allow in or out. They base their decision on a variety of factors. For example, they might allow or disallow traffic depending on the protocol being used to let web and email traffic pass but block everything else. I’ll go over the types of firewalls in this section.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Packet Filtering</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In packet filtering, one of the oldest and simplest firewall technologies, the firewall looks at the contents of each packet in the traffic individually and either allows or disallows it based on the source and destination IP addresses, the port number, and the protocol being used.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_136"/>Since the packet filtering firewall examines each packet individually and not in concert with the rest of the packets making up the traffic, an attacker could slip attacks through this type of firewall by sending attack traffic that spans more than one packet. To find these, you need to employ more complex methods of detection.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Stateful Packet Inspection</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Stateful packet inspection firewalls, or stateful firewalls, function on the same general principle as packet filtering firewalls, but they can keep track of the traffic at a granular level. While a packet filtering firewall examines an individual packet out of context, a stateful firewall can watch the traffic over a given connection. A connection is defined by the source and destination IP addresses, the ports being used, and the already existing network traffic.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A stateful firewall uses a state table to keep track of the connection state (the normal sequence of traffic) and allows traffic that is part of a new or already established connection only. This can help to prevent some intentionally disruptive attack traffic that doesn’t resemble a proper and expected connection. Most stateful firewalls can also function as packet filtering firewalls, and they often combine the two forms of filtering. In addition to packet filtering features, stateful firewalls might also identify and track the traffic related to a user-initiated connection to a website, and they’ll know when the connection has been closed, meaning no further legitimate traffic would be present.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Deep Packet Inspection</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Deep packet inspection firewalls add yet another layer of intelligence to your firewall capabilities because they can analyze the actual content of the traffic that flows through them. While packet filtering firewalls and stateful firewalls can look at only the structure of the network traffic to filter out attacks and undesirable content, deep packet inspection firewalls can reassemble the contents of the traffic to see what it will deliver to the application for which it’s destined.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To use an analogy, when you ship a package, the parcel carrier will look at the size and shape of the package, how much it weighs, how it’s wrapped, and the sending and destination addresses. This is generally what packet filter firewalls and stateful firewalls do. In deep packet inspection, the parcel carrier would do all of this as well as open the package, inspect its contents, and then make a judgment about whether to ship it.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Although this technology has great promise for blocking many attacks, it also raises privacy concerns. In theory, someone in control of a deep packet inspection device could read every one of your email messages, see every web page exactly as you saw it, and easily listen in on your instant messaging conversations.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_137"/>Proxy Servers</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Proxy servers are special kinds of firewall that pertain specifically to applications. These servers provide security and performance features, generally for an application, such as mail or web browsing. Proxy servers can provide a layer of security for the devices behind them by serving as choke points, and they allow you to log the traffic that goes through them for later inspection. They are a single source for requests.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Many companies rely on proxy servers to keep spam from reaching their users’ email accounts and lowering productivity, to keep employees from visiting websites that might have objectionable material, and to filter out traffic that might indicate the presence of malware.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">DMZs</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A <em>demilitarized zone</em> (DMZ) is a layer of protection that separates a device from the rest of a network. You accomplish this by using multiple layers of firewalls, as shown in <a href="#ch10fig2">Figure 10-2</a>. In this case, the internet-facing firewall might allow traffic through to a web server sitting in the DMZ, but the internal firewall would not allow traffic from the internet through to the internal servers.</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch10fig2"><img alt="Image" src="../images/10fig02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 10-2: A DMZ</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The DMZ creates a zone that allows public-facing servers to be accessed from the outside while both providing a measure of protection for them and restricting traffic from those servers from penetrating the more sensitive portions of your network. This helps to prevent the scenario where attackers compromise your public-facing servers and use them to attack the other servers behind them.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch10lev2sec3"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_138"/><em>Implementing Network Intrusion Detection Systems</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><em>Intrusion detection systems (IDS)</em> are hardware or software tools that monitor networks, hosts, or applications for unauthorized activity. You can classify IDS based on the way they detect attacks: signature-based detection and anomaly-based detection.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>Signature-based IDS</em> work like most antivirus systems. They maintain a database of the signatures that might signal an attack and compare incoming traffic to those signatures. In general, this method works well—except when an attack is new or has been specifically constructed to not match existing attack signatures. One of the large drawbacks to this method is that if you don’t have a signature for the attack, you may not see it at all. In addition to this, the attacker crafting the traffic may have access to the same IDS tools you’re using and may be able to test the attack against them to specifically avoid your security measures.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>Anomaly-based IDS</em> typically work by determining the normal kinds of traffic and activity taking place on the network. They then measure the present traffic against this baseline in order to detect patterns that aren’t present in the traffic normally. This method can detect new attacks, or attacks that have been deliberately assembled to avoid IDS, very well. On the other hand, it may produce a larger number of false positives than a signature-based IDS because it might flag legitimate activity that causes unusual traffic patterns or spikes in traffic.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can, of course, install an IDS that uses both the signature-based and anomaly-based methods, giving you some of the advantages of each type of detection. This would detect attacks more reliably, although it would perhaps operate a bit more slowly and cause a lag in detection.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You typically attach a network IDS to a location where it can monitor the traffic going by, but you need to place them carefully so the quantity of data to examine won’t overloaded it. Putting a network IDS behind another filtering device, such as a firewall, can eliminate some of the obviously unwanted traffic.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Since network IDS typically examine a large amount of traffic, they can generally do only a relatively cursory inspection of it, and they may miss some types of attacks, especially those that are specifically crafted to pass through such inspections. <em>Packet crafting attacks</em> use packets of traffic that carry attacks or malicious code but are designed to avoid detection by IDS, firewalls, and other similar devices.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch10lev1sec2">Protecting Network Traffic</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In addition to protecting your networks from intrusion, you need to separately protect the traffic that flows over them. When you send data over networks that aren’t secure or trusted, an eavesdropper can glean a large amount of information from what you send. If you use applications or protocols that don’t encrypt the information they’re sending, you may end up giving away your login credentials, credit card numbers, banking information, and other data to anyone who happens to be listening.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_139"/>Attackers can intercept data from both wired and wireless networks, often with little effort, depending on the design of the network. But although insecure networks are a security problem, they’re not an insurmountable one, if you have the right tools.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch10lev2sec4"><em>Using Virtual Private Networks</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Virtual private networks (VPNs) can help you send sensitive traffic over insecure networks. Often called a tunnel, a <em>VPN connection</em> is an encrypted connection between two points. You usually create the connection using a VPN client application on one end and a device called a <em>VPN concentrator</em> on the other end—a client and server, in simple terms. The client uses the VPN client application to authenticate to the VPN concentrator, usually over the internet. Once you’ve established a connection, all traffic exchanged from the network interface connected to the VPN flows through the encrypted VPN tunnel.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">VPNs can allow remote workers to access the internal resources of their organization; in that case, the worker’s device acts as though it were connected directly to the organization’s internal network.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You could also use VPNs to protect or anonymize the traffic you’re sending over untrusted connections. Companies such as StrongVPN (<em><a href="https://strongvpn.com/">https://strongvpn.com/</a></em>) sell their services to the public for exactly such purposes. You might use these to keep your internet service provider from logging the contents of your traffic, stop people on the same network from eavesdropping on your activity, or obscure your geographical location and bypass location-oriented blocking. People who use peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing services to share pirated media sometimes hide their traffic and IP addresses with VPNs.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch10lev2sec5"><em>Protecting Data over Wireless Networks</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">If you use wireless networks to send your data, you face several specific security risks. Today, a wide variety of places provide free wireless internet access. In general, public wireless networks are set up without a password or encryption of any kind—measures you’d normally put in place to protect the confidentiality of the traffic flowing over the network. Even in cases where accessing a network does require a password, like in a hotel, everyone else connected to the hotel’s network could potentially see your data. The present record for the range of an unamplified 802.11 wireless connection is about 238 miles.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch10fn4" id="kch10fn4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In addition, it’s possible for someone to attach wireless devices to your network without your knowledge. Unauthorized wireless access points, commonly known as <em>rogue access points</em>, present a serious security issue. For example, if you worked in an area that banned wireless connections, such as a secure government facility, an enterprising individual could decide to bring in an access point of his own and install it under his desk to provide wireless access to a nearby outdoor smoking area. Although he might have good intentions, his simple action might have invalidated an entire set of carefully planned network security measures.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_140"/>If the rogue access point were set up with poor security or no security at all, the well-intentioned access point installer would provide anyone within range with an easy path directly into the network that bypassed any border security in place. It’s possible that a network IDS might pick up the activity from the rogue access point, but you can’t guarantee that it will. A better solution to finding rogue equipment is to carefully document the legitimate devices that are part of the wireless network infrastructure and regularly scan for additional devices using a tool such as Kismet, which I’ll discuss later in this chapter.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When it comes to the legitimate and authorized devices on your network, your chief method of protecting the traffic that flows through them is with encryption. You can separate the encryption used by 802.11 wireless devices—the most common family of wireless network devices—into two major categories: Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) and Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2, and WPA3). WPA3 is the current standard. Compared to the other common encryption types, WPA3 makes it easier to set up client devices and offers stronger encryption, improving protections against brute-force attacks and eavesdropping.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch10fn5" id="kch10fn5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch10lev2sec6"><em>Using Secure Protocols</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">One of the simplest and easiest ways you can protect your data is by using secure protocols. Many of the more common and older protocols, such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for transferring files, Telnet for interacting with remote machines, and Post Office Protocol (POP) for retrieving email, handle data insecurely. Such protocols often send sensitive information, such as logins and passwords, in cleartext (unencrypted data) over the network. Anyone listening on the network can pick up the traffic from such protocols and easily glean the sensitive information.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Many insecure protocols have secure equivalents, as I’ll discuss at greater length in <a href="ch13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a>. In brief, you can often find a secure protocol for the type of traffic you want to carry. Instead of operating over the command line with Telnet, you can use Secure Shell (SSH), and instead of transferring files with FTP, you can use Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), which is based on SSH.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">SSH is a handy protocol for securing communications because you can send many types of traffic over it. You can use it for file transfers and terminal access, as mentioned, and to secure traffic in a variety of other situations, such as when connecting to a remote desktop, communicating over a VPN, and mounting remote file systems.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch10lev1sec3">Network Security Tools</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You can use a broad variety of tools to improve your network security. Attackers rely on many of the same tools to penetrate networks, so by using them to locate security holes in your networks, you can preemptively keep the attackers out.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_141"/>An enormous number of security tools are on the market today, and many of them are free or have free alternatives. Many run on Linux operating systems and can be a bit difficult to configure. Fortunately, you can use these tools without having to set them up by installing one of the Security Live CD distributions, which are versions of Linux that come with all the tools preconfigured. One of the better-known distributions is Kali, available for download at <em><a href="https://www.kali.org/">https://www.kali.org/</a></em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As I discussed in earlier chapters, the key to assessing vulnerabilities is to conduct assessments thoroughly and regularly enough that you can find the holes before the attackers do. If you perform penetration testing only on an occasional and shallow basis, you’ll likely not catch all the issues present in your environment. Additionally, as you update, add, or remove the various network hardware devices and the software running on them, the vulnerabilities present in your environment will change. It’s also worth noting that most of the tools you’re likely to use will be capable of finding only known issues. New or unpublished attacks or vulnerabilities, commonly known as <em>zero-day attacks</em>, can still take you by surprise.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch10lev2sec7"><em>Wireless Protection Tools</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">As I discussed earlier in the chapter, attackers who can access your network via a wireless device could bypass all your carefully planned security measures. If you don’t take steps to protect against unauthorized wireless devices, such as rogue access points, you could allow a large hole in your network security and never know it.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can use several tools to detect wireless devices. One of the best-known tools for detecting such devices is called Kismet. It runs on Linux and macOS and can also be found on the Kali distribution. Penetration testers commonly use Kismet to detect wireless access points and can find them even when they’re well-hidden.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Other tools enable you to break through the different kinds of encryption in use on wireless networks. A few of the more common ones, for cracking WEP, WPA, and WPA2, include coWPAtty and Aircrack-NG.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch10lev2sec8"><em>Scanners</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Scanners, mainstays of the security testing and assessment industry, are hardware or software tools that enable you to interrogate devices and networks for information. You can divide scanners into two main categories: port scanners and vulnerability scanners. These types sometimes overlap, depending on the specific tool.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In network security, people tend to use scanners as tools for discovering the networks and systems in an environment. One of the more famous port scanners is a free tool called Nmap, short for network mapper. Although generally considered a port scanner, Nmap can also search for hosts on a network, identify the operating systems those hosts are running, and detect the versions of the services running on any open ports.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch10lev2sec9"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_142"/><em>Packet Sniffers</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A network or protocol analyzer, also known as a packet sniffer or just plain sniffer, is a tool that can intercept (or sniff) traffic on a network. The sniffer listens for any traffic that your computer or device’s network interface can see, whether you were intended to receive it or not.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><span class="noteh1"><strong>NOTE</strong></span></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>Sniffer (with a capital S) is a registered trademark of NetScout (previously Network General Corporation). I use the term sniffer in the generic sense in this book.</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">To use a sniffer, you have to place it on the network in a position that allows you to see the traffic you’d like to sniff. In most modern networks, the traffic is segmented in such a way that you’ll likely not be able to see much of it at all (other than the traffic you generate from your own machine). That means you’ll likely need to gain access to one of the higher-level network switches and may need to use specialized equipment or configurations to access your target traffic.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A classic sniffer invented in the 1980s, Tcpdump, is a command-line tool. It has a few other key features, such as the ability to filter traffic. Tcpdump runs only on UNIX-like operating systems, but Windows systems can run a version of the tool called WinDump.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Previously known as Ethereal, Wireshark is a fully featured sniffer capable of intercepting traffic from a wide variety of wired and wireless sources. It has a graphical interface, shown in <a href="#ch10fig3">Figure 10-3</a>, and includes many filtering, sorting, and analysis tools. It’s one of the more popular sniffers on the market today.</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch10fig3"><img alt="Image" src="../images/10fig03.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 10-3: Wireshark</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_143"/>You can also use Kismet, a tool discussed earlier in this chapter, to sniff from wireless networks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Packet sniffers also come in hardware form, such as the OptiView Portable Network Analyzer from Fluke Networks. Although well-equipped portable analyzers such as this may provide benefits, such as increased capture capacity and capabilities, they’re often expensive, well beyond the budget of the average network or security professional.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch10lev2sec10"><em>Honeypots</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A somewhat controversial tool in the network security arsenal, a honeypot is a system that can detect, monitor, and sometimes tamper with the activities of an attacker. You configure them to deliberately display fake vulnerabilities or materials that would make the system attractive to an attacker, such as an intentionally insecure service, an outdated and unpatched operating system, or a network share named “top-secret UFO documents.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When attackers access the system, the honeypot monitors their activity without their knowledge. You might set up a honeypot to provide an early warning system for a corporation, to discover an attacker’s methods, or as an intentional target to monitor the activities of malware in the wild.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can also expand honeypots into larger structures by creating networks of them, called <em>honeynets</em>. A honeynet connects multiple honeypots with varying configurations and vulnerabilities, generally with some sort of centralized instrumentation for monitoring all the honeypots on the network. Honeynets can be particularly useful for understanding malware activity on a large scale since you can reproduce a variety of operating systems and vulnerabilities.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">An excellent resource for more information on honeypots and honeynets is the Honeynet Project at <em><a href="https://www.honeynet.org/">https://www.honeynet.org/</a></em>. The Honeynet Project provides access to a variety of resources, including software, the results of research, and numerous papers on the subject.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch10lev2sec11"><em>Firewall Tools</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In your kit of network tools, you may also find it useful to include tools that can map the topology of firewalls and help you locate vulnerabilities in them. Scapy (<em><a href="https://github.com/secdev/scapy/">https://github.com/secdev/scapy/</a></em>) is a well-known and useful tool for such efforts. It can construct specially crafted Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets that evade some of the normal measures put in place to prevent you from seeing the devices that are behind a firewall and may allow you to enumerate some of them. You can also script Scapy’s abilities to manipulate network traffic and test how firewalls and IDS respond, which could give you an idea of the rules on which they’re operating.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You could use some of the other tools I’ve discussed in this section to test the security of your firewalls, as well. You can use port and vulnerability scanners to look at them from the outside to find any ports that are unexpectedly open or any services running on your open ports that are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_144"/>vulnerable to known attacks. You can also use sniffers to examine the traffic that is entering and leaving firewalls, presuming that you can get such a tool in place in a network location that will enable you to see the traffic.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch10lev1sec4">Summary</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">When you protect your networks, you should do so from a variety of angles. You should use secure network design to ensure that you’ve properly segmented your networks, that you have choke points to monitor and control traffic, and that you create redundancies where you need them. You should also implement security devices such as firewalls and IDS to protect yourself both inside and outside the networks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In addition to protecting the networks themselves, you also need to protect your network traffic. To do this, you can use VPNs to secure your connections when using untrusted networks, implement security measures specific to wireless networks, and apply secure protocols.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A variety of security tools can help you keep your networks secure. When working with wireless networks, you can use Kismet. You can also listen in on network traffic with Wireshark or Tcpdump, scan for devices on your networks with Nmap, and test your firewalls using Scapy and other similar utilities. You can also place devices called honeypots on your networks specifically to attract the attention of attackers and then study them and their tools.</p>&#13;

			<p class="ChapterIntro">Supplies are essential to any preparedness plan. Keeping some extra water and shelf-stable food in the kitchen is far more sensible than walking for miles to a nearby reservoir or trapping squirrels and raccoons in a community park.</p>
			<p>Emergency gear can help you stay comfortable and informed too: for example, in the middle of a prolonged power outage, a small generator or a battery bank can get you back online so you can get a sense of what’s going on in other parts of town. At the same time, however, shopping for gear can easily turn into a habit: the thrill of unboxing new gadgets becomes an end unto itself and one can always find a way to justify adding another item to the towering pile of high-tech toys.</p>
			<p>
				Perhaps my favorite example of equipment excess is the ballistic vest. In a way, this accessory is just cool: we imagine ourselves strolling through a post-apocalyptic war zone, carrying out acts of valor with not a worry in mind. In reality, this costly gadget offers limited protection against an unlikely threat and is bulky and uncomfortable enough to preclude almost any casual use. Alas, in more than a decade in the prepping community, I must have tried to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_130" title="130"/>talk sense into at least a hundred people who were contemplating buying one, yet I don’t think I’ve ever managed to dissuade a single person from the plan.</p>
			<p>To me, the key to equipping yourself is simplicity. Ideally, every purchase you make should be subordinate to an entry in a well-researched response plan—and it should be the simplest and most effective way of solving the problem at hand. A bizarre fire-starting protocol that involves 9V batteries, steel wool, and taxidermied squirrels is probably not nearly as good as a disposable lighter or two.</p>
			<p>Getting practice with the equipment you buy is equally important. This isn’t just to avoid frantically flipping through the manuals by candlelight, and it’s not just because mastering certain tools takes a fair amount of practice and muscle memory. More simply, it’s because quality assurance mishaps happen pretty often; if you have several dozen items in your survival stash, chances are at least one of them isn’t working correctly. Camping trips can be a fantastic way to test some of the gear, but so can a drill where you don’t use running water or electricity for a couple of days, or you don’t buy any groceries for a while and cook with what you have.</p>
			<p>Maintaining an inventory is important too. Food items expire, batteries need to be replaced every now and then, and a year or two down the line, you might not remember how many cans of cheese or throwing stars are in your kit. An up-to-date spreadsheet with item names, descriptions, counts, and expiration dates is what sets prepping apart from simply hoarding junk.</p>
			<p>Lastly, every gadget should be a component of a well-defined, purpose-built kit, and the kits shouldn’t be allowed to grow with no end in sight. For example, a small tote in the trunk of your car, meant to help with roadside emergencies or workplace accidents, probably doesn’t require weeks’ worth of food or a camping stove. Similarly, a larger selection of boxed supplies meant for evacuating from natural disasters may not require tents and hunting gear, at least not in regions where motels and grocery stores are plentiful.</p>
			<p>With these principles in mind, the next several chapters will look at some of the main categories of gear that may play a role in a balanced emergency response plan.</p>

    a few clicks. Or if monitoring your daily steps, exercise data, and nutrition
    information meant checking three separate applications. Or if comparing airfares
    involved manually visiting each airline’s website.

    ago. But APIs have changed all that. They are the glue that has enabled collaboration
    across companies and transformed how enterprises build and run applications. Indeed,
    APIs have become so pervasive that an Akamai report from October 2018 found that
    API calls accounted for an astounding 83 percent of all web traffic.'

    will take notice. To these criminals, APIs are highly fertile and profitable ground,
    and for good reason. These services offer two highly desirable traits: (1) rich
    sources of sensitive information and (2) frequent security gaps.'

    check your bank balance on a mobile app, an API behind the scenes requests that
    information and sends it to the app. Likewise, when you apply for a loan, an API
    allows the bank to request your credit history. APIs sit in a critical position
    between users and the sensitive systems on the backend. If a cybercriminal can
    compromise the API layer, they could get direct access to highly valuable information.

    to lag. I recently spoke with the chief information security officer of a 100-year-old
    energy company and was surprised to learn they use APIs throughout the organization.
    But, he quickly pointed out, “whenever we look under the hood, we find they are
    often over-permissioned.”

    push new releases to consumers, and add functionality to their services. Rather
    than scheduling releases every few months, they must cycle through nightly builds
    and daily commits. There literally isn’t enough time to consider the security
    implications of every change they make, and so undiscovered vulnerabilities weasel
    their way into products.

    Take the US Postal Service (USPS). The agency published an API called Informed
    Visibility that allowed organizations and users to track packages. Appropriately,
    the API required users to validate their identity and authenticate in order to
    access any information via the API. However, once authenticated, a user could
    look up the account information of any other user, exposing the information of
    60 million users.

    with APIs. But because one of its APIs required no authentication to issue a call
    and get responses from the Peloton server, it allowed the requester to look up
    the account information of any other Peloton device (of which there are four million)
    and access potentially sensitive user information. Even US president Joe Biden,
    a well-known Peloton user, had his information exposed by this unsecured endpoint.

    power its applications and connect to financial institutions. One of its APIs
    served a marketing function by showing recent, anonymized transactions. While
    user interfaces took care of stripping out any sensitive information, the API
    would return all transaction details when called directly. Malicious users harvested
    some 200 million transactions via this API.'

    has predicted that API breaches will become the “most frequent attack vector”
    by 2022, and IBM has reported that two-thirds of cloud breaches are the result
    of API misconfigurations. The breaches also highlight the need for new approaches
    to securing APIs. The application security solutions of the past focus only on
    the most common attack types and vulnerabilities. For example, automated scanners
    search the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database for flaws in IT
    systems, and web application firewalls monitor traffic in real time to block malicious
    requests containing known flaws. These tools are well suited to detecting traditional
    threats, but they fail to address the core security challenges faced by APIs.

- en: The problem is that API vulnerabilities are not common. Not only do they vary
    highly from one API to another, but they also tend to differ from those found
    in traditional applications. The breach at USPS wasn’t a security misconfiguration;
    it was a business logic flaw. That is, the application logic contained an unintended
    loophole that permitted an authenticated, valid user to access data belonging
    to another user. This type of flaw, known as broken object level authorization,
    is the result of application logic that fails to control what an authorized user
    is able to access.

- en: Put more succinctly, these unique API logic flaws are effectively zero-day vulnerabilities,
    each of which belongs only to a specific API. Because of the scope of these threats,
    a book like this one is crucial to educating penetration testers and bug bounty
    hunters interested in keeping APIs secure. Additionally, as security shifts “left”
    to the engineering and development processes, API security is no longer strictly
    the domain of companies’ information security departments. This book can be a
    guide to any modern engineering team that conducts security testing alongside
    functional and unit testing.

- en: When done properly, API security testing programs are continuous and comprehensive.
    Tests conducted once or twice a year won’t keep up with the pace of new releases.
    Instead, testing should become part of the development cycle, such that every
    release gets vetted before moving to production, and cover the API’s entire footprint.
    Finding API vulnerabilities takes new skills, new tools, and new approaches. The
    world needs *Hacking APIs* now more than ever.

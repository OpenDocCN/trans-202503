<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">A</span>s Samsung and other manufacturers started selling their own Android-based devices worldwide, the uptick in sales that started with the Droid increased dramatically and continuously.</p>
<p>When the Droid launched, in late 2009, Android was comfortably at the bottom of the heap of smartphone platforms. By the end of 2010, just over one year later, Android devices were outselling all of them except Nokia’s Symbian OS, and they passed Symbian as well in the following year.</p>
<p>At the same time, people were increasingly choosing smartphones over <em>feature phones</em>,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c47-footnote-1" id="c47-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup> the traditional low-end (and larger) portion of the mobile market, and many people chose Android smartphones.</p>

<figcaption><p>Smartphones eventually affected the feature phone market, as people increasingly chose these more capable devices over the more limited low-end phones.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c47-footnote-3" id="c47-footnoteref-3">3</a></sup></p></figcaption>

<p>If you broaden the view to consider all computing devices, including personal computers, the numbers get even more interesting. Fulfilling one of the points that the early Android startup team made in their pitch deck,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c47-footnote-4" id="c47-footnoteref-4">4</a></sup> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_355" title="355"/>sales of Android devices have outstripped PCs since 2011 and have beaten them by more than four times since 2015.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c47-footnote-5" id="c47-footnoteref-5">5</a></sup> </p>
<p>This comparison seems, at first, perplexing; PCs (desktops and laptops of all makes and models) have been a requirement of modern life for decades. But many people in the world consider a PC as a luxury item, not a necessity; the first computing device they purchase is a smartphone. Smartphones, unlike PCs, have become <em>essential</em>; they satisfy that sweet spot of filling a need that people have (for communication, navigation, entertainment, business, or whatever) while being affordable enough that people who could not previously justify purchasing a computer could buy in to the smartphone world. They are also personal in a way that the “personal computer” never was; PCs tend to be shared equipment in a household, whereas most smartphones are used by only one person, which makes the potential market for these devices much larger than the market for PCs ever could be.</p>
<p>These trends continued in the years since. By May of 2021, there were more than three billion active Android devices<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c47-footnote-6" id="c47-footnoteref-6">6</a></sup> throughout the world.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c47-footnote-7" id="c47-footnoteref-7">7</a></sup></p>

<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c47-footnoteref-1" id="c47-footnote-1">1.</a></sup>  <em>Feature phone</em> is the designation of non-smartphones; most of the phones of that day (apart from the Danger and BlackBerry phones) were considered feature phones. They didn’t have much capability beyond phone calls and basic texting support, the screens weren’t very big, and they didn’t have the ability to install and run arbitrary apps. It’s not clear to me how they got the name feature phones, since features are pretty much what they lack. Seems like a clever phrase from a marketing department somewhere.</p></aside>

At that time, they were talking about all mobile phones, but by 2011, the same argument was true for just smartphones, and for Android in particular.</p></aside>

<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c47-footnoteref-6" id="c47-footnote-6">6.</a></sup>  This number includes more than just phones.

You realize, during your commute, that your phone—the keeper of all of your data, events, people, conversations, and, admit it, memory—is not with you. It’s like forgetting a friend, except that friends usually don’t have all of your data.</p></aside>

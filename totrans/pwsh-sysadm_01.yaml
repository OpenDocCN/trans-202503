    comes to building tools with PowerShell, it’s no different. In Parts II and III
    of this book, you’re going to learn how to build some powerful tools. But before
    you do that, you’ll need to learn the language basics. If you’re already an intermediate
    or expert PowerShell user, you’re welcome to skip [Part I](part1.xhtml#part1).
    Although you may find a nugget or two of knowledge you didn’t previously know,
    it’s probably not worth the time it takes to digest this entire part.

    language and learn about some of the constructs you’ll use constantly. We’ll cover
    everything from basic coding concepts, like variables and functions, to writing
    scripts, running them remotely, and testing them with something called Pester.
    Because we’ll go through only the basics, we won’t build too many tools just yet—that’s
    what [Part II](part2.xhtml#part2) and [Part III](part3.xhtml#part3) are for. Here
    we’ll use small examples to get our grip on the language. You’re going to get
    your first glimpse of what PowerShell is capable of. Let’s get started!

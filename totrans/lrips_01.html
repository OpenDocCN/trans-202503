reached the Mile One sign. “A mile sounds like a long way to walk, but it’s easier if
you break it into pieces.” She remembered that in Hamilton there are eight blocks to a mile,
so she made herself think about walking one block at a time.</p><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>Oh, look, another one</em></span>,” said a voice.</p><p>“Hello?” Laurie spun around, but there wasn’t much to see: some fields of
odd-looking crops, an empty road, and the sign.</p><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>She’s kind of short, isn’t she?</em></span>”</p><p>That’s when she noticed a tiny lizard clinging to the sign. It had the oddest coloring:
where the sign was green, the lizard was reddish; where it was white, the lizard was black.</p><p>“Hello, who are you?” she asked.</p><p>“I’m Xor,” the lizard squeaked. His tail twitched from yellow to blue.
“Hold on, can you <span class="emphasis"><em>see</em></span> me?”</p><p>“Of course I can see you!” Laurie said.</p><p>“Oh.” Xor looked very sad and blushed a bright purple.</p><p>“You <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> the first talking lizard I’ve ever met,”
Laurie said. “How did you learn to talk?”</p><p>“What a silly question!” the creature said. “I learned as a baby, like
everybody else.”</p><p>“You did?”</p><p>“Sure. Why, how did <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> learn to talk?”</p><p>“Well . . .” She had always been able to talk, hadn’t she? “I guess I
learned as a baby too.”</p><p>“It’s only logical. First you learn to talk, then you learn to think. Too bad
it’s not the other way around.”</p><p>“What are you doing there on the sign?” Laurie asked.</p><p>“Another silly question! What does it look like I’m doing? I am blending into the
background,” Xor said. At that moment he turned pink and violet. “Did you say
something?”</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>“Where was I? Oh, yes. Blending in is an honorable and ancient art. It takes years of
practice. You must have a pretty sharp eye to spot me.” Xor marched around the sign as he
talked, turning white with large orange polka dots.</p><p>Laurie bit her tongue, trying not to laugh.</p><p>“No, you don’t see a lizard like me every day!” He turned peach and
cornflower blue. “But sometimes—personally speaking between you and me, of
course—sometimes . . .” He looked sad again and fell silent.</p><p>“Sometimes what?”</p><p>“Sometimes, I worry I’m not doing it right.”</p><p>“Not if you want to <span class="emphasis"><em>hide</em></span>!” Laurie said, unable to contain
herself. “Your colors keep changing.”</p><p>“I was pretty sure I’d figured it out this time,” Xor said, turning his head
around to get a better look at himself.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00004a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00004"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="figs/web/013fig01.png.jpg"/></div></div><p>“My left leg is green—” he said.</p><p>“Green? No, it’s red.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Really. Now it’s purple.”</p><p>Xor sighed. “Blending in is a lot harder than it looks. I’m glad it was you who
saw me and not a hungry bird. You see, I’m a bit color-blind.”</p><p>“What kind of lizard are you, anyway?” she asked.</p><p>“I’m Chameleon, mostly. I’m part dinosaur on my mother’s
side.”</p><p>“Part <span class="emphasis"><em>dinosaur</em></span>? That’s impossible.”</p><p>“It’s true!” Xor drew his little self up proudly. “For instance, my
Aunt Vana is a Steganosaurus. She can hide anywhere, even on the back of a postage
stamp.”</p><p>Laurie wasn’t sure she believed Xor, but she didn’t want to hurt the
lizard’s feelings.</p><p>“Maybe your aunt can teach you how to hide better.”</p><p>“I’d love that. But I don’t know where she is. The last time I saw her, I
didn’t even see her!” he said.</p><p>“But—”</p><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>Hey</em></span>,” Xor said, “why don’t I come along with
<span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span>? If you can see me, maybe you’ll be able to see her,
too.”</p><p>“I don’t think—”</p><p>“It’ll be fine! I know a lot about this place. I can show you
around.”</p><p>“Well, okay. I can carry you in my pocket,” Laurie said. “Have you heard of
Hamilton?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Can you eat it?”</p><p>“Never mind. Let’s go.”</p></div></body></html>

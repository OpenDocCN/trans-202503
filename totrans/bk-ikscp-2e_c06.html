			</header>
			<p class="ChapterIntro"><a id="91"/>In Inkscape (and in SVG), <em>transformation</em> has a
very narrow meaning.  It does not refer to any
change of an object but only to the four simple operations that affect an entire
object in the same way: <em>moving</em>,<em>scaling</em>, <em>rotating</em>, and <em>skewing</em>. Nothing else is considered a
transformation.</p>
			<p>Metaphorically, transforming objects is moving around the furniture in
your house without repainting the walls or opening up any cabinets.</p>

					<h2>The transform attribute</h2>
					<p>
						Transformations applied to an object are often (but not always) stored as the <code>transform</code>
attribute in SVG; for more on when this attribute is or is not written, as well as the relevant
preferences settings, see <a href="b01.xhtml#sectionA.7">A.7</a>.</p>

				For the mathematically inclined,
the term is actually an abridgment of  "affine transformation," where <em>affine</em> means that
such a transformation preserves straight lines, parallel lines, and the ratios of the lengths of segments on a line,
but may not preserve sizes or angles.</p>
			<a id="section6.1"/><h2>
				6.1 <a id="92"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_92" title="92"/>The Selector: Moving</h2>
			<p>After selecting objects, transforming them is the second most important function of the
Selector tool. And of all the kinds of transforming, moving is the easiest: just grab an
object (if it is not selected yet, clicking will select it; you just need to be in the
object's clickable area for this to work) and drag.</p>
			<p>
				Such <em>free dragging</em> is easy and inspiring. You likely will do a lot of it in the
early stages of your work when you move things around to establish the overall composition.</p>
			<p>
				During later stages, however, you're more likely to use <em>constrained
dragging</em>. The most common constrained mode is horizontal or vertical dragging with
Ctrl (<a href="#fig6-1">Figure 6-1</a>). If you press and hold Ctrl while dragging,
Inkscape creates two invisible "rails," one horizontal and one vertical, which intersect
at the point where the dragging started. The selection can then move only along those
rails, jumping from one to the other depending on which is closer.</p>
			<a id="fig6-1"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="07/ctrldrag.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 6-1: Constrained dragging with Ctrl</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Using Ctrl has the same general effect of constraining your actions in many other situations as well.
(In this, Inkscape is different from Adobe applications that
normally use Shift for a similar purpose.)  Many more ways to constrain object
movement are available via snapping, discussed in the next chapter.</p>
			<p>As you saw in the previous chapter, selecting just the objects you need
may be difficult; you may have to use Alt-clicking (selecting under)
and Ctrl-clicking (selecting inside groups) to get to the objects you need. Now, if you
want to drag these selected objects around, you may run into another problem: any drag starts
with a click, and that click may easily ruin your carefully constructed selection by
selecting something else, such as the object  that happens be on top of your
objects or the containing group.</p>
			<p>
				Often, the easiest workaround for this problem is to move the selection with the arrow
keys, not by dragging the mouse (<a href="#section6.5">6.5</a>). If you absolutely need to mouse-drag, start
dragging while pressing  Alt. This forces the current selection
to be dragged without inadvertently selecting other objects. You can even start your Alt-drag to
move the selection from any point—not from the selection itself but from
an empty canvas or any other object.</p>
			<p>
				You might wonder how this Alt-drag is compatible with Alt-click—which<em>does</em> change selection by "selecting under." Unlike
regular click-to-select, however, "selecting under" happens not when you click your mouse button
but when you <em>release</em> it after a click. If, between click and release, you didn't
move your mouse <a id="93"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_93" title="93"/>by more than the click/drag threshold (<a href="c05.xhtml#section5.4">5.4</a>, the default is 4 screen
pixels), this is considered a click, and "selecting under" is performed. Otherwise,
the current selection is moved.</p>
			<p>
				Finally, moving with Shift lets you temporarily suppress snapping (<a href="c07.xhtml#section7.3">7.3</a>). This is sometimes convenient when you normally use snapping and don't want to disable it, but just need to place a certain thing exactly where snapping won't let it go.</p>
				<a id="section6.2"/>
				<h2>6.2 The Selector: Scaling</h2>
			<p>
				Our next topic is <em>scaling</em> the selection—making
it bigger or smaller. Scaling is not the same as zooming; when you zoom, you just
view your drawing from closer up or from farther away without changing it.
Scaling means actually resizing the objects; this is an undoable action.</p>
			<p>
				For scaling your selection, the Selector tool displays eight handles, four at the
corners and four on the sides of the selection's bounding box, as shown in <a href="#fig6-2">Figure 6-2</a>. Dragging the side handles
scales the selection in one direction (horizontally or vertically); dragging the corner
handles scales it in both directions.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>
						Are the handles too small on your screen and hard to use? You can select the most comfortable handle size in <span class="ui">Preferences<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Interface<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Handle size</span>. This setting also affects the nodes in the Node tool (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.5">12.5</a>).</p>

				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 6-2: Scaling with the Selector tool</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				By default, the corner handles can move freely in any direction. This
means that the ratio between width and height (also called <em>aspect ratio</em>)
of the selected objects may <em>not</em> be preserved. You can stretch or squeeze your
selection, or you can make it taller <em>and</em> narrower, or lower <em>and</em> wider, in a single drag. Side handles also
do not preserve the aspect ratio as they scale in one dimension only.</p>
			<p>
				The simplest way to lock the aspect ratio is to scale with Ctrl.
This makes scaling proportional for both corner and side handles. Another way
to achieve this is via the lock toggle in the Selector 
controls bar above the canvas, between the <span class="ui">W</span> and <span class="ui">H</span> editable fields, as shown in <a href="#fig6-3">Figure 6-3</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig6-3"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="07/sel-lock.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 6-3: The aspect ratio lock in the Selector 
controls bar</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="94"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_94" title="94"/>When this lock is on (pressed), corner handles always scale proportionally. Side
handles, however, are not affected by the lock and still scale in only one
dimension.</p>
			<p>
				Normally, scaling works in such a way that the opposite side (for side handles) or
the opposite corner (for corner handles) of the selection's bounding box remain fixed. Sometimes,
however, you will want the center of the selection to be fixed so that 
it is scaled symmetrically out from the center. This is what
Shift does. To make this obvious, the fixed point of a transformation is always
indicated by a cross mark, as shown in <a href="#fig6-4">Figure 6-4</a>.</p>

						Here's a useful mnemonic. When typing text, pressing Shift makes 
the letters <em>bigger</em> (uppercase); when scaling, it also makes the 
result twice as big as it would be without Shift
(since it scales on both sides of the center).</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>
				You can combine Shift-scaling with Ctrl for ratio-constrained central-symmetric scaling. Not limited to the center or corners, you can place the fixed point of scaling anywhere, as
you'll see in <a href="#section6.4">6.4</a>.</p>
			<p>
				The remaining modifier, Alt, also has a role during scaling. It lets you
scale the selection by integer multipliers: up to 2, 3, 4,... times the
original size or down to <span class="fraction">½</span>, <span class="fraction">⅓</span>, <span class="fraction">¾</span>,... of the original size (along one or both dimensions). You can combine Alt 
with Ctrl to lock the aspect ratio and/or with Shift to scale around
the center of the selection.</p>
			<a id="section6.3"/><h2>6.3 The Selector: Rotating and Skewing</h2>
			<p><em>How do I rotate objects?</em> is a surprisingly common question on Inkscape users' forums
and mailing lists. The trick is to switch the Selector tool
into <em>rotate mode</em>, and here's how this
is done: by a <em>second click</em> on the selection. (It must be a<em>distinct</em> second click, not a double-click.) A third click toggles the Selector back
into scale mode, a fourth returns it to rotate mode, and so on, as shown in <a href="#fig6-5">Figure 6-5</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig6-5"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="07/sel-modes.svg.png"/>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="95"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_95" title="95"/>There's one problem with the second click. Just as with moving, it may not always
be possible to click the selection without selecting something else (if, for example,
selected objects are in groups or under other objects). Instead of a second click, just press
Shift-S to switch to the rotate mode or back.</p>

						When your canvas is rotated (<a href="c03.xhtml#section3.13">3.13</a>), the scale and rotation handles may look weird because they stick to the original orientation; when the canvas is rotated 180 degrees, they even end up inside the selection's bounding box instead of outside of it.  This seems to be just a cosmetic bug, however; no matter how it looks, the handles work as expected in the rotated coordinate system.</p>

				When rotating, Ctrl constrains the rotation angle to fixed angle steps, by default every 15 degrees (<a href="#fig6-6">Figure 6-6</a>).</p>

you can choose a value from 0.5 degrees to 90 degrees (all the values there are divisors of 360), or <span class="ui">None</span> for no constraint.</p>

corner. For example, Shift-rotating the top-right handle makes the bottom-left corner fixed.</p>
			<a id="section6.4"/><h2>6.4 The Fixed Point</h2>
			<p>
				Once you switch the Selector tool into rotate mode, you'll see a cross mark in
the center of the selected object or objects. This is the <em>fixed point</em> of rotation. This
point is remembered for each object as one of its permanent properties—moving it is an undoable action, and
fixed points of all objects are saved with the document. Scaling, rotating, and skewing are performed
around this point not only with the Selector tool but with most other methods as well (such as in the<span class="ui">Transform</span> dialog or when transforming by keyboard shortcuts).</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>In Inkscape's UI (and in the previous edition of this book), the fixed point is called the "center of rotation," which is doubly confusing as it need not be in the center and it applies not only to rotation.</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>By default, the fixed point is in the geometric center of the bounding box of an
object.  With the Selector tool, you can freely drag it to any location (inside or outside the object
itself). When dragged, the fixed point snaps to the edges of the object's bounding
box, to the geometric center (its original location), and to the horizontal and vertical
axes going through the geometric center. This makes it easy to snap the fixed point
back into the original position or to a corner of the bounding box. Drag it with
Shift to suppress snapping; drag it with Ctrl to limit its movement
to horizontal/vertical axes.</p>
			<p>If you move the object (by any means, not only by dragging with Selector), its fixed point
moves along with it, so it always stays in the same relative position to the
object. There's no way to move an object's fixed point
using the keyboard—you can only drag it with the mouse.</p>
			<p>
				When more than one object is selected, the selection as a whole also has a
fixed point. By default, of course, it is in the geometric center of the bounding box.
However, if the object that you selected <em>last</em> (if you've been
adding to selection with Shift-clicks) or the
one that is the <em>topmost</em> in the z-order (if you've <a id="97"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_97" title="97"/>selected by rubber band or by
Ctrl-A) ever had its fixed point moved from the default position,
then the entire selection will have the same fixed point as that object.</p>
			<p>
				If, with multiple objects selected, you drag the selection's fixed point,
it applies to <em>all</em> selected objects—each of them will have this new
fixed point position. For example, if you draw a wheel with multiple spokes, you can
select all the spokes and move the fixed point to the center of the wheel just
once. After that, even if you select a single spoke, it will conveniently rotate around
the center of the wheel.</p>
			<p>
				Also, the fixed point is inherited when you duplicate or clone (<a href="c16.xhtml#section16.1">16.1</a>) an
object. For example, you can draw a single spoke, move its fixed point to the center
of the wheel, then go on duplicating (or cloning) that spoke and simply rotate each copy using any
method (dragging corner handles with the Selector tool, keyboard shortcuts, or the<span class="ui">Transform</span> dialog). The new spokes will remain firmly set inside the wheel, as shown in <a href="#fig6-8">Figure 6-8</a>.</p>

			<h2>6.5 Transforming with Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
			<p>Transforming objects by dragging them or their handles on the canvas is easy and
intuitive, but it's not very precise (even when using various constrained modes) and may
sometimes feel quite clumsy. Many long-time Inkscape users prefer to use keyboard shortcuts for
most of their transformations.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>You can move, rotate, and scale from the keyboard, but you cannot skew (skewing is not used all that often, though).</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>Keyboard shortcuts for transforming objects are easy to remember and,
often, can make your work a lot easier.  Another reason to learn these shortcuts is that, as
you will see in the rest of the book, they are used consistently in many other tools and
contexts to perform analogous functions—for example, to transform nodes in the Node tool,
text characters in the Text tool, or gradient handles in the Gradient tool.</p>
			<a id="section6.5.1"/><h3>6.5.1 Moving</h3>
			<p>The ←, →, ↑, and ↓ arrow keys move the selection. The amount of move depends on the
modifiers.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a id="98"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_98" title="98"/>Without modifiers, arrow keys move selection by 2 px (2 SVG pixel units, not screen pixels, <a href="b01.xhtml#sectionA.6">A.6</a>). You can change this default value in the <span class="ui">Behavior<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Steps</span> page of the <span class="ui">Preferences</span> dialog.</li>
				<li>With Alt, arrows move selection by 1 screen pixel (not SVG pixel). This means the actual distance will depend on the zoom level—you can do finer moves when you are zoomed in or coarser moves when zoomed out. This is one of the most useful shortcuts because of its precision and adaptability: with Alt, you can move your selection by the minimum distance that is still noticeable at the current zoom.</li>
				<li>With Shift, arrows move selection by 10 times the distance that they would without Shift. So simple Shift-arrows move by 20 px (by default), and Shift-Alt-arrows move by 10 screen pixels at the current zoom.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The ease and predictability of the keyboard move commands make them useful in a lot
of different situations. For example, sometimes I need to do something to objects
obscured by a large foreground object. Alt-clicking to "select under" works
but is not super convenient; moving the foreground object to a new layer and hiding
that layer is also a good option but quite cumbersome. In such cases, I often
select the foreground object and move it off (to the right) with several
→ or Shift-→ keystrokes. When finished, I will select it
again and move it back into place with the exact same number of 
movement keystrokes in the opposite direction. (Do not use Alt-arrows in this case
because you may be at a different zoom level when moving the object back, and that would
affect the distance.) This "move away and then back" trick is also handy for analyzing
complex compositions when I'm trying to figure out which parts of the drawing correspond to
which objects.</p>
			<a id="section6.5.2"/><h3>6.5.2 Scaling</h3>
			<p>The &lt; and &gt; keys (angle brackets)
scale a selection down and up, respectively. Keyboard scaling always preserves aspect ratio and
is performed around the geometric center of an object's bounding box (not around its movable
fixed point). Again, the amount of scaling depends on the modifiers.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Without modifiers, the &lt; and &gt; keys scale so that the larger of the two dimensions of the bounding box grows by 2 px (2 SVG pixel units, not screen pixels). For example, if the object is wider than it is tall, its width grows by 2 px (the left and right edges of the bounding box move by 1 px each in opposite directions), and its height grows by a proportionately smaller amount.  You can change the default value of 2 px in the <span class="ui">Behavior<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Steps</span> page of the <span class="ui">Preferences</span> dialog.</li>
				<li>With Alt, the &lt; and &gt; keys scale so that the larger of the two dimensions of the bounding box grows by 2 screen pixels (not  SVG pixels). The  edges of the bounding box move by 1 screen pixel each in opposite directions. As with Alt-arrows, this means the actual scale depends on the zoom level; you can do finer scaling when zoomed in or coarser when zoomed out.</li>
				<li><a id="99"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_99" title="99"/>Shift has no effect on the &lt; and &gt; keys. This is because on some keyboards, you need to press Shift just to get those characters. By the way, the , (comma) and . (dot) work as &lt; and &gt;, respectively, because on many keyboards they are physically the same keys.</li>
				<li>With Ctrl, the &lt; and &gt; keys scale by a factor of two—that is, they make the selection twice as small and twice as large, respectively. This is convenient when you need to scale something by a large ratio; for example, start by pressing Ctrl-&gt; a few times to get within the ballpark of the required size, then adjust it precisely using the same key with Alt or without modifiers.</li>
			</ul><a id="section6.5.3"/>
			<h3>6.5.3 Rotating and Flipping</h3>
			<p>The [ and ] keys (square brackets) rotate selection
counterclockwise and clockwise, respectively. Rotating is performed around the fixed point
that is visible in Selector's rotate mode; unless you moved it, it's the
geometric center of the object's bounding box.  Again, the amount of rotation depends on
the modifiers.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Without modifiers, the [ and ] keys rotate by 15 degrees. This is the same angle step that is used by mouse rotation with Ctrl. You can change it in the <span class="ui">Rotation snaps every</span> drop-down menu in the <span class="ui">Preferences</span> dialog.</li>
				<li>With Alt, the [ and ] keys rotate by such an angle that the bounding box corners of the selection move by 1 screen pixel. This means the actual rotation angle depends on the zoom level, and you can make finer rotations when zoomed in or coarser when zoomed out.</li>
				<li>Shift has no effect on the [ and ] keys, for the same reason it has no effect on the &lt; and &gt; keys.</li>
				<li>With Ctrl, the [ and ] keys rotate by 90 degrees (one quarter of a full circle).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Also, some common transformations are accessible both as keyboard shortcuts and as
buttons on the Selector tool's controls bar (<a href="#fig6-9">Figure 6-9</a>):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Rotate selection by 90 degrees counterclockwise and clockwise (also
accessible via Ctrl-[ and Ctrl-]).</li>
				<li>Flip (mirror) selection horizontally and vertically (also accessible via the
H and V shortcuts).</li>

			<p>
				To make two objects exchange places, use the <em>double flipping</em> trick. First,
select both objects and flip them as a whole. Then, select each one in turn and flip it
individually to restore it. To make the exchange two-dimensional, simply
perform <a id="100"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_100" title="100"/>this procedure twice, once with horizontal flipping (H) and then
with vertical flipping (V).</p>

			<p>
				Artists sometimes use flipping to check their work.
It's easy to grow progressively more blind to 
errors in your drawing—simply because you're looking at it for
so long. That's when flipping the entire drawing horizontally or vertically gives
you a fresh look and makes many problems with shape, balance, or
composition painfully obvious. You can also use canvas rotation (<a href="c03.xhtml#section3.13">3.13</a>) for the
same purpose.</p>
			<a id="section6.6"/><h2>6.6 Transforming with Numbers: X, Y, W, and H</h2>
			<p>Sometimes, neither mouse nor keyboard transformation methods are quite up to the
task because you
want to move objects a specific distance or to a specific point, or rotate them a specific angle.
Inkscape allows you to specify exact numeric values for
transforming.</p>
			<p>
				One way to do this is via the Selector tool's controls bar, as shown in <a href="#fig6-10">Figure 6-10</a>.</p>

of the page, but you can flip it to the bottom left (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.2">4.2</a>).</p>

			<p>
				To the right of the editable fields, a drop-down menu selects the
unit in which the values are expressed. Supported units
include <span class="ui">in</span> (inches), <span class="ui">pt</span> (points, each point being 1/72 of an inch),<span class="ui">mm</span> (millimeters), and <span class="ui">cm</span> (centimeters). The default unit is<span class="ui">px</span> (SVG pixel, <a href="b01.xhtml#sectionA.6">A.6</a>, which is 1/96 of an inch now,
but it was 1/90 of an inch in Inkscape versions before 0.92).</p>
			<p>
				One of the most useful units is the <span class="ui">%</span> (percent). It lets you scale an object not
to an absolute size but as a percentage relative to its current size. For example, to
scale the selection 1.5 times up, switch the unit to <span class="ui"><strong>%</strong></span> and type <code><strong>150</strong></code> in the <span class="ui"><strong>W</strong></span>
and <span class="ui"><strong>H</strong></span> fields (or, if you click the lock button between them, only in one of them).</p>

				6.7 <a id="101"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_101" title="101"/>The Transform Dialog</h2>
			<p>
				The most powerful tool for transforming objects numerically is the <span class="ui">Transform</span>
dialog (Shift-Ctrl-M). It has separate tabs for each of the four
transformation types we've been discussing (moving, scaling, rotating, and skewing) as well
as a tab for the complete transformation matrix. Generally, you choose one of the tabs,
type the values you want, and click <span class="ui"><strong>Apply</strong></span>.</p>
			<p>Let's look at these tabs in order.</p>
			<a id="section6.7.1"/>
			<h3>6.7.1 The Move Tab</h3>
			<p>
				We'll begin with the <span class="ui">Move</span> tab, shown in <a href="#fig6-11">Figure 6-11</a>.</p>
				<a id="fig6-11"/>
				<figure>
				<img alt="" src="07/transform-move.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 6-11: The <span class="ui">Move</span> tab of the <span class="ui">Transform</span> dialog</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Unlike the <span class="ui">X</span> and <span class="ui">Y</span> values in the Selector controls bar, which always
show you the absolute coordinates of the selection, in the <span class="ui">Move</span> tab,
you can view and specify either
absolute coordinates or relative displacements. By default, the <span class="ui">Relative
move</span> checkbox is on, so the <span class="ui">Horizontal</span> and <span class="ui">Vertical</span> fields
display zeros, and any numbers you type there will move selection<em>by</em> that much (for example, the values of <code><strong>3</strong></code> and <code><strong>0</strong></code> move the selection by 3 units
horizontally to the right).</p>
			<p>
				Now, uncheck the <span class="ui"><strong>Relative move</strong></span> checkbox.
You will see that the fields now display the current coordinates of the selection—the same as the <span class="ui">X</span> and<span class="ui">Y</span> fields in the Selector controls bar. The units drop-down menu also works similarly.</p>
			<a id="section6.7.1.1"/><h4>6.7.1.1 Moving to Adjust Intervals</h4>
			<p>
				If several objects are selected and both the <span class="ui">Apply to each object
separately</span> and <span class="ui">Relative move</span> checkboxes are turned on, each object
will be shifted, not relative to its own previous position, but relative to its
neighbor—the nearest selected object to the left (for X) or below (for Y). This
makes it possible to "space out" or "tighten up" collections of objects.</p>
			<p><a id="102"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_102" title="102"/>For example, if you need to space out a horizontal row of objects, select them and
move them horizontally by 5 px with both checkboxes checked. The leftmost object
will shift by 5 px to the right, the next one by 10 px, and so
on until the rightmost selected object is displaced by 5<em>n</em> px
where <em>n</em> is the number of selected objects. As a result, each interval between
adjacent objects will increase by 5 px, and the whole row will be spaced out,
much like how a letterspacing adjustment spaces out a text string (<a href="c15.xhtml#section15.4.5">15.4.5</a>). Moving these
objects by –5 px will, conversely, squeeze them tighter together, the
leftmost one moving by 5 px to the left, the next one by 10 px,
and so on. For vertical moves, the effect is the same except that it starts from the
object closest to the top (that is, the object with the smallest Y coordinate).</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>The order in which objects are shifted may not be obvious if they overlap. The
rule is that either the left edges (for horizontal moves) or tops (for vertical moves) of the
objects' bounding boxes are sorted to determine which object to move relative to
which. The order in which you selected the objects or their z-order makes no difference.</p>

			<h3>6.7.2 The Scale Tab</h3>
			<p>
				Next we'll look at the <span class="ui">Scale</span> tab, shown in <a href="#fig6-12">Figure 6-12</a>.</p>
				<a id="fig6-12"/>
				<figure>
				<img alt="" src="07/transform-scale.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 6-12: The <span class="ui">Scale</span> tab of the <span class="ui">Transform</span> dialog</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Here, the default unit is <span class="ui">%</span>, which allows you to 
scale selection by a given ratio (such as 200% to scale it up twice or 50% to scale it down
to half the size). The units drop-down menu also contains all the absolute units you may need
(switching to them changes the displayed values from 100% to the width and height of the
selection in the chosen unit). The <span class="ui">Scale proportionally</span> checkbox is
analogous to the lock button on the Selector's controls bar.</p>
			<p><a id="103"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_103" title="103"/>So far, everything this tab can do is also possible via the Selector
tool's <span class="ui">W</span> and <span class="ui">H</span> controls. However, the <span class="ui">Apply to each
object separately</span> checkbox is unique to this dialog. It applies the same scaling to
each selected object, scaling it around its own fixed point (<a href="#section6.4">6.4</a>) instead of
scaling the selection as a whole around its center. For the <span class="ui">%</span> unit, this means
scaling each selected object by the same ratio; for all other units, this results in all
selected objects getting the same specified width and height.</p>
			<p>
				Unlike the <span class="ui">Move</span> tab (and the Selector controls), values on the <span class="ui">Scale</span>
tab do not update automatically when
you transform a selection by other means (such as by dragging handles), nor when you just
select a different object: the values you typed stay put. This is handy if you
want to apply the same size to many different objects, but sometimes this can be a
problem—you may assume that the displayed value in absolute units is that of the
currently selected object when that's not the case. To reset the
values back to 100% of the current selection, click the <span class="ui"><strong>Clear</strong></span>
button.</p>
			<a id="section6.7.3"/><h3>6.7.3 The Rotate Tab</h3>
			<p>
				Now we'll move on to the <span class="ui">Rotate</span> tab, shown in <a href="#fig6-13">Figure 6-13</a>.</p>
				<a id="fig6-13"/>
				<figure>
				<img alt="" src="07/transform-rotate.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 6-13: The <span class="ui">Rotate</span> tab of the <span class="ui">Transform</span> dialog</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Rotate</span> tab contains a single editable field for the rotation
angle. Positive values rotate counterclockwise; negative values rotate clockwise. The
default unit is the degree (360 degrees to a full circle), but you can switch it to
radians (2 × π = 6.283 radians to a full circle). The <span class="ui">Apply to each object
separately</span> checkbox works as expected: instead of rotating the entire selection
around the selection's fixed point (<a href="#section6.4">6.4</a>), it rotates each object separately around
its own fixed point.</p>
			<a id="section6.7.4"/><h3>
				6.7.4 <a id="104"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_104" title="104"/>The Skew Tab</h3>
			<p>
				Next is the <span class="ui">Skew</span> tab, shown in <a href="#fig6-14">Figure 6-14</a>.</p>
				<a id="fig6-14"/>
				<figure>
				<img alt="" src="07/transform-skew.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 6-14: The <span class="ui">Skew</span> tab of the <span class="ui">Transform</span> dialog</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Skew</span> tab contains two editable fields for horizontal and vertical
skewing, which basically means displacing one of the four sides of the bounding box
along itself, slanting the adjacent perpendicular sides. The <span class="ui">Apply
to each object separately</span> checkbox works the same as for scaling and rotating,
skewing each object around its own fixed point.</p>
			<p>The units drop-down menu contains absolute length units, percent, and angular
units (degree and radian). Here's how they work:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>Absolute units</dt>
				<dd>
					With an absolute unit, the <span class="ui">Horizontal</span> value specifies the absolute
displacement of the top edge of the selection to the left (positive) or to the right
(negative); the <span class="ui">Vertical</span> value specifies the displacement of the left edge up
(positive) or down (negative).
				</dd>
				<dt>Percent</dt>
				<dd>
					With the % unit, the amount of displacement is
calculated as the given percentage of the adjacent perpendicular side of the bounding
box. In other words, this percentage is equal to the <em>tangent of the skew angle</em>. For
example, skewing an upright rectangle vertically by 100% results in its 
formerly horizontal sides becoming slanted by 45 degrees. 
				</dd>
				<dt>Angular units</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>This allows you to set the slant angle directly —that is, the
angle of the sides adjacent to the side being moved. For example, vertically skewing an
object by 45 degrees is the same as skewing it by 100% or by the absolute value of the object's
width. Skewing by 90 degrees does not work, because it would create an infinite-sized object.</p>
				</dd>
			</dl><a id="section6.7.5"/>
			<h3>
				6.7.5 <a id="105"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_105" title="105"/>The Matrix Tab</h3>
			<p>
				Finally, we'll look at the <span class="ui">Matrix</span> tab, shown in <a href="#fig6-15">Figure 6-15</a>.</p>
				<a id="fig6-15"/>
				<figure>
				<img alt="" src="07/transform-matrix.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 6-15: The <span class="ui">Matrix</span> tab of the <span class="ui">Transform</span> dialog</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				This tab allows you to edit the object's <em>transformation
matrix</em>, which is stored in its <code>transform</code> attribute (<a href="b01.xhtml#sectionA.7">A.7</a>). A detailed explanation
of the algebra of transformation matrices is outside the scope of this book; for
practical purposes, it's enough to know that the two rightmost values (labeled<span class="ui">E</span> and <span class="ui">F</span>) represent the displacement of the object (how far it has
been moved from the origin), and the four other values collectively encode its scaling, rotation, and
skew.</p>
			<p>
				By default, the <span class="ui">Edit current matrix</span> checkbox is unchecked and the tab
presents an <em>identity matrix</em> where <span class="ui">A</span> and <span class="ui">D</span> are 1 and all other
values are 0. If you change any values and click <span class="ui">Apply</span>, this matrix will be<em>post-multiplied</em> with the current matrix of the object—that is, applied to the selected
object on top of its current transformation. If you check the <span class="ui">Edit current
matrix</span> checkbox, the tab will show and let you directly edit the current matrix
of the selected object. (If more than one object is selected, the matrix of the first or
bottommost selected one will be displayed.)</p>
			<p>
				Here's how you can reset the<code>transform</code> attribute of an object without going to the XML Editor. Check<span class="ui"><strong>Edit current matrix</strong></span>, click <span class="ui"><strong>Clear</strong></span> (this resets the values to the
identity matrix), and then click <span class="ui"><strong>Apply</strong></span>.</p>
			<a id="section6.8"/><h2>6.8 Pasting Sizes</h2>
			<p>
				A quick way to assign a specific size to an object without using any dialogs is
by <em>pasting</em> that size on it. First,  copy 
(Ctrl-C) an object whose size you want to assign to other objects. Then,
use the commands from the <span class="ui"><strong>Paste Size</strong></span> submenu in the <span class="ui"><strong>Edit</strong></span>
menu.</p>
			<p><a id="106"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_106" title="106"/>The commands of this submenu perform various combinations of pasting:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Pasting width only (height is unchanged), height only (width
is unchanged), or size (both width and height).</li>
				<li>
					Pasting to the selection as a whole or to each selected object
separately (analogous to the <span class="ui">Apply to each object separately</span>
checkbox in the <span class="ui">Transform</span> dialog).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				For example, if you imported a number of bitmap images and want to create a
gallery of thumbnails out of them, you can unify their sizes by drawing a rectangle of
the desired thumbnail size, copying it to the clipboard, selecting all the images,
and choosing <span class="ui">Edit<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Paste Size<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Paste Size Separately</span>.</p>
			<a id="section6.9"/><h2>
				6.9 The Measure Tool <span class="NoteHead">[1.1]</span></h2>
			<p>
				To transform by numbers, you first need to know what these numbers are—you need to <em>measure</em>.
As you've seen, selected objects constantly measure themselves, reporting their coordinates and dimensions.
But Inkscape also has a versatile Measure tool (M, the ruler icon on the toolbar on the left)
that will cover more of your measurement needs than you ever thought existed.</p>
			<a id="section6.9.1"/><h3>6.9.1 Hovering</h3>
			<p>
				The first thing you'll notice, even before you click anything, is that the tool displays basic information
about any objects you <em>hover</em> upon. This means you don't need to select an object to look up its size or
X/Y coordinates—just switch to the Measure tool, move your mouse, and read it from your screen.</p>
			<p>
				Just as in Selector, the tool by default treats groups as objects, reporting information about the group. If you need
to look up an object inside a group, simply press Ctrl (again, no clicking, just Ctrl-hover).
For paths (<a href="c12.xhtml#ch12">Chapter 12</a>) and shapes (<a href="c11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11</a>), the tool also reports the <span class="ui">Length</span> of the path, as shown in <a href="#fig6-16">Figure 6-16</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig6-16"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="07/measure.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 6-16: Using the Measure tool: the <span class="ui">Length</span> of a circle with the diameter of 1 equals π.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The first few controls on the tool's controls bar let you adjust aspects of the overlay display: its <span class="ui">Font size</span> (which does not depend on zoom),<span class="ui">Precision</span> (number of fractional digits) of the numbers, <span class="ui">Units</span> of measurement, and the <span class="ui">Scale</span> (default 100%), which allows
you to see all values scaled by some coefficient.  In <a href="#fig6-16">Figure 6-16</a>, I upped the precision to 6 to get
more digits of π.</p>
			<a id="section6.9.2"/><h3>
				6.9.2 <a id="107"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_107" title="107"/>Dragging</h3>
			<p>
				Imagine a spring-loaded measuring tape: you hook it at some point and 
stretch it to another point, then you read the distance between them.
That's exactly what you do in the  Measure tool when you click and drag.
In addition to the <em>length</em>, it also displays the <em>angle</em> (red arc)
of your measuring tape (blue line) from the horizontal (red line), as shown in <a href="#fig6-17">Figure 6-17</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig6-17"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="07/measure-distance.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 6-17: Measuring the distance and angle between two points</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				After you release mouse, the measuring tape you just pulled out stays put on the canvas; its ends
become two round markers that you can freely (or constrainedly with Ctrl)
drag around and see the numbers continuously update. 
If you want to set precise coordinates for one of the handles, Shift-click it
and enter the coordinates in the position dialog that pops up. You can also swap the start and
end of the measurement line with the <span class="ui">Reverse measure</span>  button on the controls bar.</p>
			<p>The  whole  measurement overlay disappears when you switch to another tool—but it will pop back up when you go
back to the Measure tool. Click-and-drag somewhere else to replace the old measurement with a new one;
I have found no way to "retract the tape"—to simply remove the existing measurement.</p>
			<a id="section6.9.3"/><h3>6.9.3 Measuring and Constraining Angles</h3>
			<p>The angle of your measurement line from the horizontal is readily available; measuring arbitrary angles
between lines (neither of which is horizontal) is possible too but a little tricky. If you have two lines and want to measure the angle between them,
start at their intersection and drag along one of the lines. Then, press and release Ctrl (without releasing mouse);
this will reset the base of the angle measurement to the current direction. Then, drag to the second line
and read the angle.</p>
			<p>
				Dragging with Ctrl, as expected, constrains the angle of your measurement line to angle steps
(go to <span class="ui"><strong>Behavior<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Steps</strong></span> in <span class="ui"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> to change). 
However, since pressing Ctrl <em>while dragging</em> resets the base of the angle measure, you need to
press and hold Ctrl <em>before</em> you start to drag if you want to constrain (for example, to measure strictly
horizontally or vertically).</p>
			<a id="section6.9.4"/><h3>6.9.4 Measuring Segments</h3>
			<p>The Measure tool can do something you can't easily do with a measuring tape: measure multiple distances
along the same line. If you let your measurement line cross any objects, you will see that each intersection
divides the line into segments, and the tool reports the length of each segment.</p>
			<p><a id="108"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_108" title="108"/>For example, if you cross an uppercase <em>B</em> with a vertical measurement, you will get as many as six separate readings:
the widths of all three
horizontal stems, the gaps between them, as well as the overall height of the letter, as shown in <a href="#fig6-18">Figure 6-18</a>. (At the bottom, it
also reports the total length of the measurement line, but you're not interested in that because
you could start and end it in random points so long as it crosses what you want to measure.)</p>
			<a id="fig6-18"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="07/measure-b.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 6-18: Measuring the stems and gaps of a letter shape: the red X marks are the intersection points; each segment shows its length.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				This also works for any number of different objects that your line crosses: the tool will report
segment lengths for each one it encounters, covering their widths as well as the gaps inside and between objects.
When crossing stroked (<a href="c09.xhtml#ch9">Chapter 9</a>) paths or shapes, the tool reports only intersections with the path
centerline, not with the visible edge of a stroke.</p>
			<p>You can create a measurement line in
some strategic axis of your drawing and just leave it there as you keep working (it is not shown in
other tools, so it does not get in the way). At any time, switch to the Measure tool to read updated
numbers for the moved or newly created objects that cross your axis.</p>
			<p>
				On its controls bar, the tool has a number of options for how it treats intersections, as shown in <a href="#fig6-19">Figure 6-19</a>.</p>
				<a id="fig6-19"/>
				<figure>
				<img alt="" src="07/measure-bar-5buttons.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 6-19: The Measure tool: options for intersections</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<ul>
				<li>
					You may want to reduce
clutter by reporting only intersections and lengths for <em>selected objects</em>, as opposed to all objects (the default).</li>
				<li><a id="109"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_109" title="109"/>
By default, the tool does not show lengths of the <em>first and last segments</em> because they depend on the position of your
measurement line's ends, which may be somewhat arbitrary; you can change that.</li>
				<li>The third button controls
reporting the lengths between and inside objects; by default it's on, but if you turn it off, you will see only the first
and last intersections on the line and the length between them.</li>
				<li>
					The fourth button controls whether the tool marks <em>hidden intersections</em>. Here, "hidden" does not refer to hidden objects (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.1">4.1</a>) but to those intersections that are obscured (where they cross the measurement line) by other objects on top of them. By default, hidden intersections are shown, but you can hide them to reduce clutter.</li>
				<li>Finally, the fifth option lets you limit intersections and measurement to the current layer; by default, the tool looks at objects in all visible layers.</li>
			</ul><a id="section6.9.5"/>
			<h3>6.9.5 Phantom Measurements</h3>
			<p>
				Whenever you drag to start a new measurement, the old one disappears. What if you want to have two or more
measurements visible at the same time? That is possible if you turn the current measurement into a<em>phantom</em> by clicking the button with the camera (that is, "taking a snapshot") on the controls bar.</p>
			<p>A phantom measurement behaves almost like a normal measurement, except you
cannot drag its ends and it is shown in uniform gray instead of red/blue. Unfortunately, unlike the
current "live" measurement, phantoms do not survive switching to another tool and back, which makes
them not too useful in practical work.</p>
			<a id="section6.9.6"/><h3>6.9.6 Creating Measurement Objects</h3>
			<p>The constructions that the Measure tool creates—both the current measurement and
any phantoms—are not part of your document. It's just an informational overlay.
But if you want to have a real flesh-and-blood object that shows a measurement, the
Measure tool can do that, too.</p>
			<p>
				Before going into objects, however, let's look at <em>guides</em> the Measure tool can also create for you.
Guides (<a href="c07.xhtml#section7.1">7.1</a>) are not quite real either in that they are not printed and not shown by SVG
viewers outside Inkscape; however, they are definitely more real than Measure tool's machinery because
they are visible in any tool (though you can hide them) and are saved/restored with the document. When you press
the <span class="ui">To guides</span> button on the controls bar, the current measurement generates a bunch of guides—one for the
measurement line itself, two horizontal/vertical crosses for its start/end points, and one slanted for each of the intersections, as shown in <a href="#fig6-20">Figure 6-20</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig6-20"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="07/measure-guides.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 6-20: The Measure tool can generate guides.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="110"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_110" title="110"/> The Measure tool's guides are purple-colored (unlike the regular guides that are blue by default) and are helpfully labeled. Still, if you convert more than a couple measurements to guides, your canvas may look rather messy, with bundles of guides continuing infinitely in all directions. In many cases, if you want to save your measurement to posterity, it is better to  convert the whole shebang to an object. That's what the next button on the controls bar, <span class="ui">Convert to object</span>, does (<a href="#fig6-21">Figure 6-21</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig6-21"/>
			<figure>
				<img alt="" src="07/measure-convert.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 6-21: The Measure tool can generate objects, too!</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>At first blush, the newborn object is undistinguishable from the measurement overlay: it faithfully reproduces all the lines, cross marks, and semitransparent labels. And yet it is an object—you can drag it around, zoom into it, ungroup, delete objects inside its group, and so on.</p>
			<p>
				The next button, <span class="ui">Mark dimension</span>, presents yet another approach to object creation. Instead of trying to mimic the Measure tool's overlay, it creates a plain, solid black dimension marking with arrowheads plus a text object giving the length (<a href="#fig6-22">Figure 6-22</a>). This applies only to the overall length of the measurement and ignores any intersections or angles. The only parameter you can adjust is the distance from the measurement line where this object will be placed (<span class="ui">Offset</span> on the controls bar, always in px units).</p>

			<p>
				The Tweak tool (W or Shift-F2) is a versatile instrument that
applies the same "soft brush" metaphor not only to transforming objects but also to
styling them (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.9">8.9</a>) and to path editing (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.6">12.6</a>). This tool has a number of <em>modes</em>; in this chapter, I
describe those modes that deal with transforming, duplicating, and deleting objects. Using
these modes, you can <em>draw by scattering</em>—sweep, sway, or sculpt fields of objects,
such as Spray tool effusions (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.7">4.7</a>) or clone tilings (<a href="c16.xhtml#section16.6">16.6</a>), into complex and naturalistic images.</p>
			<p>
				All modes of the Tweak tool share a number of common features.
In all of them, you use a circular soft-edged brush (the orange circle you see under the
cursor) controlled by the <span class="ui">Width</span> and <span class="ui">Force</span> parameters on the controls
bar and optionally affected by the pen pressure (if you have a pressure-sensitive tablet). You
"paint" with this brush over the selected objects to act on them.</p>
			<p>
				The <em>width</em> of the brush varies from 1 to 100, but these aren't absolute units;
at any zoom, 1 gives you a very small brush and 100 gives you a brush
approximately the size of your screen. The tool shows the current brush width as a circular
brush outline centered on your mouse cursor. To change the width, use the <span class="ui"><strong>Width</strong></span> control on the toolbar or
the ← (narrower) and → (wider) keys. The brush is soft; its
action peaks in the center and smoothly decreases toward the edge following a
bell-like profile.</p>
			<p>
				Similarly, <em>force</em> ranges from 1 (very weak—you need to stroke an object
several times to get  a visible effect) to 100 (very strong—the first stroke of the
brush applies the maximum effect). To change the force, use the toolbar control
or press the ↓ (weaker) and ↑ (stronger) keys.</p>
			<p>
				To get a feeling of how the Tweak tool works, create a number of small objects in a test
drawing—for example, with the Spray tool (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.7">4.7</a>) or just by manually duplicating
(Ctrl-D) or cloning (Alt-D) an object and dragging away the
copies. Now, select all the objects you created, switch to the Tweak tool, adjust the <span class="ui"><strong>Width</strong></span>
so the circle covers several objects at once, set <span class="ui"><strong>Force</strong></span> to a moderate value of 20,
enable one of the modes (described below), and start dragging over the
objects. <a href="#fig6-23">Figure 6-23</a> shows what will happen.</p>

			</figure>
			<dl>
				<dt>Move mode</dt> <dd>
					<p>Moves the selected objects  under the
brush in the direction in which you drag the brush. This is not entirely unlike
just dragging these objects around—except you're not dragging them:
your brush softly "sweeps" the objects it runs across.
Note that the Tweak tool only ever affects selected objects (even though it doesn't show the selection cue);
it's usually best to separate the objects you're tweaking often into a layer, so you can make it current
and select them all with Ctrl-A.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Attract/Repel Objects mode</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>Attracts the selected objects
under the brush toward the cursor (default) or repels them away from the cursor
(with Shift pressed). This way you can "pull in" (make denser) or "push out" (make sparser) different areas of
your scattering of objects.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><a id="112"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_112" title="112"/>Move Jitter mode
				</dt> <dd>
					<p>
						Moves the selected objects under the
brush in random directions by random distances. The harder you press (with a pressure-sensitive pen) and the higher
the <span class="ui">Force</span>, the heavier the jitter is. This is a way to "shake up" your composition in places where 
it's becoming too uniform.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Scale mode</dt> <dd>
					<p>Scales the selected objects under the
brush down (by default) or up (with Shift pressed). This way you can
introduce smooth scale nonuniformities to your scattering—to make objects larger
in some parts of the image and smaller in others.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Rotate mode</dt> <dd>
					<p>Rotates the selected objects under the
brush clockwise (by default) or counterclockwise (with Shift pressed). This
way you introduce rotation non-uniformities to your scattering—for example, to
"bend" your scattering texture to match the dominant directions in different parts
of the image.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Duplicate/Delete mode</dt> <dd>
					<p>Randomly duplicates some of the
selected objects under the brush (by default) or deletes some of them (with
Shift pressed). The chance that an object is duplicated or deleted, as
always, depends on force and pen pressure. This completes the "scatter drawing" toolset
by providing a way to thicken or thin out your scattering wherever necessary.</p>
					<p>
						As with the regular <span class="ui">Duplicate</span> command (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.5">4.5</a>), duplicating with the Tweak tool
places the copies right over the originals, so it is a good idea to use the Jitter mode
after duplicating to ruffle them apart. The duplicates created <a id="113"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_113" title="113"/>by the tool are
automatically added to selection if the original objects were selected.</p>

			<h2>6.11 What Transformations Affect</h2>
			<p>
				Now that you can transform your objects using all kinds of methods, let's look 
at what exactly gets transformed when you do it. As it turns out, Inkscape can optionally
transform or not transform some specific parts or aspects of objects. This is controlled by the
four toggle buttons on the right end of the Selector controls bar, as shown in <a href="#fig6-24">Figure 6-24</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig6-24"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="07/sel-affect.svg.png"/>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<dl>
				<dt><span class="ui">Stroke width</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						This option applies only to scaling and has no effect on
moving, rotating, or skewing. When it's on, any scaled object that has stroke
(<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.2">8.2</a>) will have the width of the stroke scaled by the same ratio. For
example, if you scale an object with a 2-px-wide stroke to twice its current size and this
button is on, the resulting object will have 4-px-wide stroke. If the button is off, it
will have the same unchanged stroke width of 2 px.</p>
					<p>
						When you scale an object without preserving the aspect ratio, if this
button is on, stroke gets scaled by the square root of the product of
vertical and horizontal scale ratios. (I know!)
A slightly simpler way to put it is that the stroke scale ratio will be the<em>geometric mean</em> of the horizontal and vertical ratios.
For example, if you scale an object to twice its
width horizontally but leave its height unchanged, the stroke becomes wider by a
factor of 1.415 (the square root of 2).</p>
					<p>Keeping stroke width unscaled is more commonly useful. For example, in a plan or
draft, you normally want all your objects to have the same fixed stroke width,
unaffected by scaling, so you would toggle this button off. It only makes sense
to turn this on when you're using stroke as a purely visual element (such as
brush-like strokes in a freehand drawing).</p>

			<dl>
				<dt><span class="ui">Rounded rectangle corners</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						This option also applies only to scaling and
has no effect on moving, rotating, or skewing. It controls whether Inkscape scales the
rounded corners of rectangles (<a href="c11.xhtml#section11.2.2">11.2.2</a>). When it's on, a rectangle is scaled as a whole,
just as it would be scaled if converted to path; this may lead to the rounded corner
becoming larger, smaller, and/or nonround. When it's off, Inkscape preserves the
rounded corners exactly as they were. Turning this off can be <a id="114"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_114" title="114"/>useful, for example, in a flowchart
diagram where you want all your boxes to have the same rounded corners regardless of their
sizes.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><span class="ui">Gradients</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						This button controls whether transformations are applied to the
gradients in objects' fills or strokes (<a href="c10.xhtml#section10.1">10.1</a>). Since gradients (more precisely,
positions of gradient stops) can be moved, rotated, and skewed as well as scaled, this
button applies to any kind of transformations. When it's on, the gradient stops are
transformed as a whole with the object carrying the gradient. When it's off, the
gradient stays glued to the canvas (unchanged in position, direction, or scale) while
the object is transformed.</p>
					<p>
						For example, with this button toggled off, it is possible to move an object<em>out</em> of its own gradient or scale it up so that more of the gradient becomes
visible. This is useful when the gradient's position is coordinated with other
objects in your drawing whereas the object itself is simply a "window" onto that gradient, and
you want to move or adjust the edges of that window without touching the gradient
itself.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><span class="ui">Patterns</span></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						This button is analogous to the <span class="ui">Affect
gradients</span> button except it applies to patterns (<a href="c10.xhtml#section10.8">10.8</a>) instead of
gradients.</p>
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<p>
				With a path, another way to "transform" it without affecting stroke width, gradients, or patterns (regardless of these Selector options) is by selecting all of its nodes in the Node tool and transforming the node selection (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.5.7.3">12.5.7.3</a>).</p>

						There's an annoying but harmless bug: regardless of the status of
the transform options, interactive transforming of objects by mouse in the
Selector tool always shows stroke, rounded corners, gradients, and patterns as fully
transformed <em>while you're dragging the mouse</em>. As soon as you release the mouse,
the display of the object is fixed.</p>

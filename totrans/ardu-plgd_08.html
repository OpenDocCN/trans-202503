<div class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Microcontrollers are used in many, if not most, commercial and scientific instruments. They are accurate and versatile, which makes them a relatively low-cost solution to a variety of measurement requirements. This project combines an Arduino microcontroller with a commercial probe and some analog circuitry to construct an accurate meter that measures <em>pH</em>, the relative acidity or alkalinity of a solution.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">There are three basic ways of measuring pH. This project involves using a pH meter and probe. The other approaches are litmus paper indicators, which you might remember from high school chemistry, and colorimeters, the traditional swimming pool maintenance kit. The latter is usually a kit of chemical reagents with a comparison color chart. Of the three, a pH meter is by far the most accurate.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_186"/>But what does pH measure, exactly? The pH value describes the activity of hydrogen ions in aqueous solutions. The higher the activity of hydrogen ions, the more acidic the solution is and the lower the pH is. Less activity of hydrogen ions (and greater activity of hydroxide ions) results in a higher pH.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The pH scale is logarithmic. A difference of one pH measurement unit represents a tenfold increase or reduction of hydrogen-ion activity in the solution. This explains how a solution’s aggressiveness rapidly increases with the distance from the neutral point on the pH scale.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig1">Figure 7-1</a> shows the finished Custom pH Meter, and if you wonder why measuring pH is useful, “<a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07note1">Why Measure pH?</a>” on <a href="ch07.xhtml#page_187">page 187</a> discusses several answers to that question.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="ch07lev1sec1"><strong>Why Build Your Own pH Meter?</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Commercial pH meters run the gamut of prices from low-cost portable units under $60 to full-fledged laboratory instruments costing several hundred or several thousand dollars. Relatively low-cost pH meters can do the job, but all have drawbacks, such as marginal accuracy, relatively short lifetime, calibration issues, and consistency.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A variety of pH meter kits are also available, including many stamps, some designed for the Arduino. (A <em>stamp</em> is a small circuit board with the critical circuitry to perform some function, minus the processor.) I have not had a chance to sample these kits, but they tend to be pricey, running close to or over $100. And they still require a power supply and packaging.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">While this project doesn’t propose to offer a full-scale laboratory instrument, it provides a good, workable pH meter and gives a lot of insight into what actually comprises a pH meter. I’ve made every attempt to tune the circuit for optimal performance, but you may find further adjustment helpful, so if you want to try something different after seeing the circuit, go for it.</p>&#13;

<p class="boxtitle"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_187"/><a id="ch07note1"/><strong>WHY MEASURE pH?</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In the past, pH was a relatively obscure measurement, confined to the laboratory bench and industrial environments (for quality control, process control, measuring and controlling waste effluents, and so on). However, more people have started using scientific measurement in areas that have traditionally relied on rote instructions or trial-and-error experimentation, like home winemaking and beer brewing, hydroponics, home agriculture, hydroculture, and baking. All of these applications can benefit from accurate pH measurement, and they don’t even include the more mundane task of managing the chemistry of your swimming pool, koi pond, fountain, or aquarium.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For example, in baking, dough needs a low pH to rise. The pH of foods also impacts two of the four tastes: low-pH, or acidic, foods tend to taste sour, while higher-pH, or more alkaline, foods taste bitter. Lemon juice is an example of sour, and broccoli rabe or dark chocolate can be considered bitter. In home gardening, pH is an important soil characteristic for particular crops. Simple adjustments in pH can make aquarium water clear and reduce scum deposits on the glass sides, and a balanced pH in ponds keeps fish healthy and reduces algae. And the list goes on.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="ch07lev1sec5"><strong>About the pH Probe</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">At the heart of the Custom pH Meter is a pH probe. This measures the activity of hydrogen ions in a solution, which in turn determines the acidity or alkalinity of that solution. A basic pH probe, like the one in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig4">Figure 7-4</a>, comprises two elements: a reference electrode and a measurement electrode. I won’t go into the chemistry of the probe or the exact mechanism of a pH probe’s operation, but I will describe its output and interface to the circuitry that provides the readout.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A pH probe produces a voltage proportional to the pH of the solution the probe is immersed in. The pH range starts at 0, which is the most acidic, and goes up to 14, which is the most alkaline. The probe delivers an output voltage from approximately –420mV to +420mV, representing an increment of roughly 60mV per unit of pH. A neutral pH of 7.0, at mid-scale from 0 to 14, is represented by 0.0mV.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The nature of the probe’s output makes the Custom pH Meter’s basic function in this project relatively straightforward: it needs to read and display a voltage. But there are a few other things the Custom pH Meter circuit has to account for. First, while commercial probes are built to the highest standards, they can be off by some nominal amount and require adjustment. Second, we’re dealing with relatively small values, so to maintain accuracy, components and circuits have to be carefully selected. Further, as probes are used and age, they tend to change slightly, requiring recalibration.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_190"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f07-04.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch07fig4"/><em>Figure 7-4: A simplified drawing of a pH probe</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Finally, the pH probe has a very high electrical impedance—perhaps 10 to 100 megaohms or higher. Practically speaking, a high impedance means that despite the voltage level, there is very little energy available to change the state or condition of another device, so the circuit needs to amplify that signal. This requires a specialized input circuit involving an op-amp, which is designed to minimize noise while handling the high-impedance signal. Today’s semiconductors are up to the task, and as I discuss in “<a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07lev2sec4">Some Notes on IC Selection</a>” on <a href="ch07.xhtml#page_196">page 196</a>, I checked out several op-amps to find one that seemed to offer the best combination of performance and price. Of course, while a good op-amp is important, the circuitry feeding input to the op-amp must also be as efficient as possible to achieve an accurate reading without introducing noise that could affect the sensitive output of the pH probe.</p>&#13;
<div class="box1">&#13;
<p class="boxtitle"><strong>TAKING CARE OF YOUR pH PROBE</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">While your pH probe probably came with instructions, there are a couple of things you can do to increase its useful life. First, of course, follow the manufacturer’s instructions. Second, unless the manufacturer specifies differently, when storing your probe, immerse the business end in a 3-molar solution of potassium chloride (KCl), as shown in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig5">Figure 7-5</a>. You should be able to buy such a solution wherever you purchase your pH buffer solutions at a very modest cost. (A <em>buffer solution</em> is a mix of relatively weak acidic and alkaline chemicals that produces a specific pH.) You can also compound your own by dissolving about 22 g of KCl in 100 mL of distilled water.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_191"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f07-05.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch07fig5"/><em>Figure 7-5: The pH probe I used for this project. The tip is protected in a small vial of KCl solution with a rubber seal</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Even for relatively short storage times, it is best to keep the probe in a pH 7 buffer solution rather than in air or water. Between samples or when moving the probe to a different buffer solution, make sure to rinse the probe carefully. Most manufacturers suggest rinsing with distilled water. You can gently blot the excess water off the probe, but most manufacturers caution against rubbing or wiping the electrode bulb for fear of creating an error due to polarization.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When calibrating your probe prior to a measurement, the manufacturers of even top-of-the-line pH meters suggest calibrating with a buffer closest to the expected pH of the sample. For example, if you suspect the pH value of the sample to be around 9, use a pH 10 buffer solution to calibrate the instrument.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch07lev1sec6"><strong>The Schematic</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The Custom pH Meter circuits shown in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig6">Figures 7-6</a> and <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig7">7-7</a> comprises a dual op-amp, a voltage inverter to supply ±5V to the op-amp, a voltage regulator, a temperature IC, an Arduino, and an I<sup>2</sup>C LCD. You have the option to build your Custom pH Meter with an Arduino Nano or an Arduino Pro Mini. I had an easier time building the breadboard with a Nano, but my final product (and therefore, the shield PCB file provided for this chapter) uses the Pro Mini to conserve space.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The rest of this section describes the reasoning behind the design decisions made in creating this schematic.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_193"/><em><strong>Integrating the High-Impedance Probe</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Recall that the pH probe delivers a DC output voltage that swings from –420mV to +420mV, giving approximately 60mV per unit of pH. This output is delivered at very high impedance, and the circuit must accept the probe’s high-impedance input without adding spurious signals, reduce the impedance to a manageable level, and amplify the input so it can be read by the analog inputs of the Arduino. The circuit also has to provide a way to adjust the voltage that goes to the display in order to calibrate the probe in terms of both offset and gain (see “<a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07note2">Offset and Gain</a>” on <a href="ch07.xhtml#page_194">page 194</a> for a crash course).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To handle the high-impedance probe output, the input of the op-amp must have a very high impedance, typically in the teraohm (1×10<sup>12</sup> ohms) range, to read any voltage at all. The input of the op-amp must also have a low input current (the two go together); this is typically around 10 picoamps (1×10<sup>−12</sup> amps), though some op-amps offer input current below 25 femtoamps (1×10<sup>−15</sup> amps). It’s also good if the op-amp has very low <em>drift</em> (that is, tendency to change output with no change in input).</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec2"><em><strong>General Design Notes</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The Custom pH Meter is designed to work from a power supply of 9V, selectable between a battery and a plug-in module via a power switch (see the schematics in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig6">Figures 7-6</a> and <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig7">7-7</a>). Because the input from the AC source could be suspect, the Custom pH Meter uses an external voltage regulator rather than the regulator built into the Pro Mini. An LM7805 with bypass capacitors at both the input and output worked well in previous projects, and this project uses the same regulator. This regulator supplies positive 5V to the inverter, the op-amp circuitry, and the Arduino. The power switch is a three-position switch, where the center is off, one position selects the battery, and the other selects AC power.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Because the pH probe provides an output of ±420mV, this circuit has to be able to handle a <em>bipolar</em> (above and below ground) voltage. The simplest way to achieve that is to use an op-amp with positive and negative supplies and a ground in the middle, which in turn requires a power supply that can provide those voltages. The LMC7660 voltage inverter is the solution: it converts the positive 5V from the voltage regulator to +5V and –5V, with ground in the middle. Thus, the op-amp can handle the input signal as long as it doesn’t go above +5V or below –5V.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="bgblack">NOTE</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>Most voltage inverters are very similar to the LMC7660 and require minimal external components—in this case, only two capacitors. This circuit uses tantalum capacitors because of their compact size and reliability, but electrolytic capacitors could be used</em>.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<div class="box1">&#13;
<p class="boxtitle"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_194"/><a id="ch07note2"/><strong>OFFSET AND GAIN</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">To demonstrate how offset and gain work, <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig8">Figure 7-8</a> illustrates the continuum of voltage used in this project, from –5V to +5V.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f07-08.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch07fig8"/><em>Figure 7-8: An illustration of what happens to the voltage when changing the gain and offset on the Custom pH Meter</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Imagine that when the voltage from the pH probe is amplified, there is a voltage range A. In this illustration, voltage A represents half the supply voltage, ranging from –2.5V to +2.5V for a total of 5V. If the gain is adjusted, the voltage range will still center on 0V but will increase or decrease to some voltage range B. Adjusting the gain will always increase or decrease the lower and higher ends of the selected voltage sector equally, provided the original sector is within the total voltage range.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The entire voltage sector can also be shifted within the continuum by adjusting the offset, as illustrated in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig8">Figure 7-8</a>. The range of voltage A2 still encompasses the same total voltage as range A, but its minimum and maximum voltages are different. In this instance, the center of the voltage range is shifted from 0V to 2.5V, such that voltage A2 swings from 0V to 5V.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This offset can be any voltage within the supply range, but in practice, it’s best not to run the voltage to the voltage rails (the maximum and minimum of the supply voltage). Instead, leave some buffer between the rails and the voltage range a project needs.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“<a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07lev1sec11">The Sketch</a>” on <a href="ch07.xhtml#page_205">page 205</a> shows that the Custom pH Meter maps the voltage within the limits of the supply to the Pro Mini (0V to +5V) to be an average of the gain selected. The final gain and offset adjustments for this project are made using the prepared buffer solutions and the potentiometers in the circuit.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_195"/>The Custom pH Meter uses a Deek-Robot Pro Mini Arduino clone because this clone is small and inexpensive; however, a Nano could work if you make your own shield-printed circuit board. While the Pro Mini does not include a USB interface, there are a variety of ways to program it with little effort. See “<a href="ch00.xhtml#ch00lev2sec4">Connecting and Programming an Arduino Pro Mini</a>” on <a href="ch00.xhtml#page_8">page 8</a> if you’ve never used this particular Arduino before.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The I<sup>2</sup>C interface for the display comprises only two wires—clock and data—in addition to power and ground. The I<sup>2</sup>C protocol can also be used with several I<sup>2</sup>C devices at the same time, if required.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec3"><em><strong>The Op-Amp Circuit in Detail</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In the op-amp circuit, there are resistors and capacitors to minimize the effect of spurious signals and to couple the circuits. The amplifier circuit has two stages, which are both included in the single package of the opamp: the first handles the high impedance from the probe and offers gain adjustment, while the second is a buffer that provides the offset, both for calibration and to accommodate the 0 to +5V analog input required by the Arduino. Each stage has a 10-turn trimmer potentiometer. The trimmer in the first stage is 1 megaohm, and it sets the gain; the trimmer in the buffer stage is 10 kilohms, and it is used for the offset.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The first stage provides most of the gain (the output is roughly six times the value of the input), which is adjustable via a negative feedback resistor (R2) and a potentiometer (R3). The adjustment range is a bit wider than required, but it works out quite well. Initially, I tightened up on the range but found that for some probes, a smaller range makes calibration difficult.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The second stage op-amp circuit uses a fixed feedback resistor of 10 kilohms (R5), while the noninverting input uses a combination of two resistors of 10 kilohms each (R1 and R2) and a 10-kilohm potentiometer (R4) to provide the offset adjustment. This stage provides a small amount of gain in addition to the offset adjustment to allow the pH probe voltage to center on 0mV (pH of 7) and swing between –420mV (pH of 0) and +420mV (pH of 14). In addition, this buffer stage changes the scale from a negative and positive voltage to a positive-only voltage for the Arduino.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Using the buffer stage to both provide the calibration offset and convert the plus-minus voltage swing works out conveniently with little, if any, discernable downside. Optionally, a separate reference voltage could be generated, but that would add additional components and offers little advantage over offsetting the voltage from the buffer stage and referencing the voltage to ground.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">At the output end of the buffer, a Zener diode (D1) and resistor (R9) are added to protect the Pro Mini from any overvoltage condition. No protection was added to protect against a negative voltage to the analog input pin; however, during initial setup and experimentation, the analog pin accidentally received a negative voltage many times with no adverse effects.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_196"/><em><strong>Some Notes on IC Selection</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindentb">Before settling on an IC for any project, it is a good idea to test multiple ICs to see which works best in your situation. When sampling chips, I suggest keeping notes on the pros and cons of each chip. For example, these are my notes on op-amp possibilities for the Custom pH Meter:</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent-s"><strong>TL072</strong>   Worked well; a good all-around solution</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent-s"><strong>TLC2262</strong>   A good all-around solution; a toss-up between this and the TL072</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent-s"><strong>OPA129</strong>   Worked well, but not available in DIP</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent-s"><strong>LMC6001</strong>   Worked well, but a little pricey for no advantage, at around $20</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent-s"><strong>LMC6042</strong>   Probably would have worked, but was difficult to set up</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent-s"><strong>LMP7702</strong>   Probably would have worked, but a little pricey and was difficult to set up</p>&#13;
<p class="indentt">After trying several op-amp circuits in the public domain with mostly disappointing results, I used a generalized circuit to test each of these op-amps in turn, and for each test, the circuit required a certain amount of tuning to work. This tuning included changing the circuitry to stabilize gain and minimize spurious signals and stray voltages. The Texas Instruments TL072P op-amp proved the best option, and once I made that selection, I adjusted the circuit further to optimize it for the Custom pH Meter. The TLC2262 also would have worked well; I used it in some prototype samples.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The other op-amps I sampled might have worked as well, or almost as well, if optimized like the TL072; however, that would have been time consuming for a marginal or zero gain. The final Custom pH Meter circuit represents a best effort within self-imposed limitations, like budget. For example, a top-shelf op-amp, like the Texas Instruments OPA627/637, probably would have worked well, but the chip alone had a price tag between $25 and $50, depending on the version. That would have brought the total budget for the project to well over $100, a self-imposed limit. The decision to continue the project itself was already problematic because of the probe’s cost ($36 at the time of writing); however, I believe the probe’s capabilities warrant the expense.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch07lev1sec7"><strong>Preparing the LCD</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Before you build the circuit on a breadboard, make sure the LCD is prepared for prototyping. Though the LCD used in this project can be purchased with the I<sup>2</sup>C adapter board, I have often had to buy the LCD and the adapter board separately, as was the case this time. When you buy them separately, the adapter board usually comes with header pins installed, and all you should have to do is insert them into the display and solder them. “<a href="ch00.xhtml#ch00lev1sec2">Affixing the I<sup>2</sup>C Board to the LCD</a>” on <a href="ch00.xhtml#page_3">page 3</a> describes this process.</p>&#13;
<div class="box1">&#13;
<p class="boxtitle"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_197"/><strong>ON LCD BACKLIGHTS</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">When I initially wired the I<sup>2</sup>C board to the display board for the Custom pH Meter, I cut off the cathode (K) header terminal on the display board. The anode and cathode headers allow you to provide a voltage to power the display’s backlight. The idea behind severing the connection was to include a separate switch to turn the backlight on and off to preserve battery current. It turned out the display was not readable without the backlight except in extremely bright light, so I abandoned that effort and manually rewired the backlight. You can experiment with other displays to try to find an ambient-light readable display.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch07lev1sec8"><strong>The Breadboard</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Like most of my Arduino projects, the Custom pH Meter began with a breadboard (see <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig9">Figure 7-9</a>). Despite the somewhat ragged appearance, the breadboard iteration worked well.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f07-09.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch07fig9"/><em>Figure 7-9: This circuit on a breadboard served as a proof of concept for the Custom pH Meter</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In addition to the basic Custom pH Meter circuit, I added a separate circuit (visible in the upper-left area of the breadboard in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig9">Figure 7-9</a>) to supply a continuous, variable ±500mV test voltage so I could check the circuit and do some preliminary calibration prior to testing with the probe itself. This test circuit, shown in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig10">Figure 7-10</a>, comprises a separate voltage inverter, a pair of voltage dividers, and a potentiometer to vary the voltage. You may want to set up this small circuit on a separate breadboard and use it to do the preliminary adjustment of the finished unit.</p>&#13;

<p class="figcap"><a id="ch07fig10"/><em>Figure 7-10: This circuit provided the test voltage for the Custom pH Meter</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig9">Figure 7-9</a>, the pH probe is held by an inexpensive burette clamp attached to an old machinist’s magnetic gauge holder. The probe was too thin to fit in the holder, so I wrapped some foam around the probe to clamp it.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Preparing this breadboard turned out to be a little messier and more convoluted than usual because there’s a lot on the board. As shown in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig9">Figure 7-9</a>, I used a large breadboard that included four vertical breadboards and a strip across the top for positive and negative rails. Initially, I used an Arduino Nano clone to build the Custom pH Meter on the breadboard. In the finished version, however, I suggest using a Deek-Robot Pro Mini board to reduce the size. Both Arduinos use the same 5V, 16 MHz Atmel 328 processor and other components. In keeping with the requirement to have the shortest possible connection to the input of the op-amp, the BNC connector is situated to provide a relatively direct connection to the noninverting input of the op-amp. The voltage regulator, an LM7805, is located in the upper right of the breadboard and is powered with either a 9V alkaline battery or a 7.5V to 12V wall adapter.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here are the steps I took to construct the breadboard:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">Connect all vertically oriented positive and negative rails (marked by red and blue stripes, respectively) to the horizontal positive and negative rails across the top of the breadboard.</p></li>&#13;

<li><p class="noindent">Mount capacitor C3 (10 μF) between pins 2 and 4 of the LMC7660. (Make sure to observe polarity: connect the positive side to pin 2 and the negative side to pin 4.)</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">Mount capacitor C4 (10 μF) between pin 5 of the LMC7660 and the blue negative rail. (Make sure to observe polarity: the plus side of the cap goes to the blue negative rail.)</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">Connect pin 3 of the LMC7660 to the blue negative rail.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">Connect pin 8 of the LMC7660 to the red positive rail.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_199"/>Insert the voltage regulator (LM7805) into the right-hand section of the breadboard.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">Connect pin 1 of the LM7805 to a blank row that will accept the incoming 9V or 7.5V voltage. (It can accept from +7V to +12V, as shown in the schematic.)</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">Connect pin 2 of the LM7805 to the blue negative rail.</p></li>&#13;

<li><p class="noindent">Connect the ground of the BNC to the closest spot available on the blue negative rail. (I used a panel-mount BNC connector and screwed a piece of stiff wire to the flange so I could mount it very close.)</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">Connect pin 4 of the TL072 to the negative voltage of the LMC7660 (pin 5).</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">Insert one lead of capacitor C6 (0.1 μF) to pin 4 of the TL072, as close to the chip as possible.</p></li>&#13;

<li><p class="noindent">Insert the outside pins of potentiometer R7 (1 megaohm) between pins 1 and 2 on the TL072.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">Insert a short jumper from pin 2 to pin 3 of potentiometer R7. The potentiometer will work with only the two pins (center and one end) used. For convention and stability, I usually connect the center to the pin not being varied.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">Insert capacitor C7 (0.1 μF) from pin 1 to pin 2 of the TL072.</p></li>&#13;

<li><p class="noindent">Insert the Arduino Nano into the breadboard. I placed it in the second row from the left toward the bottom of the board so the USB connection would be easily available.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">Connect 5V from the Nano (pin 27) to the red positive rail.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">Connect the ground of the Nano (pin 29) to the blue negative rail.</p></li>&#13;

<p class="indent">In <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig9">Figure 7-9</a>, at the upper left of the board, you will see four resistors and a potentiometer on three wires. That’s the probe voltage simulator circuit in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig10">Figure 7-10</a>. To wire up the simulator circuit, make the following connections:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">Connect the open end of resistor R5 (10 kilohms) to negative 5V (pin 5 of the LMC7660).</p></li>&#13;

</ol>&#13;
<p class="indent">The temperature sensor is not included in the breadboard.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Finally, calibrate the Custom pH Meter. I suggest calibrating first with the simulator circuit and then with the actual probe, as described in the next section.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch07lev1sec9"><strong>Calibrating the Custom pH Meter</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Calibrating the Custom pH Meter for the first time may be a little trying, but it shouldn’t take long to get the hang of it, and it should work well afterward. First, set both the scale and offset potentiometers as close to the middle of their ranges as possible. Because pH 7 is neutral, start there, put the probe in the pH 7 solution, and adjust the offset until the display reads 7.00.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Next, clean the probe, place it in the pH 4 solution, and adjust the scale trimmer until the display reads 4.00. After that, clean the probe again, and try the pH 7 solution again; the reading should remain close to center. If it is off center, then adjust the offset to exactly 7.0 again, and repeat the process. This time, it should require only a small adjustment to set the scale to pH 4.0. Now, check the display with the probe in the pH 10 buffer solution, see how far off the reading is, and adjust the scale trimmer accordingly. Repeat this process until the readings match all three buffer solutions. (After about three or four tries, adjusting both scale and offset, I got it to line up perfectly.)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you know the meter works, I suggest resetting it and calibrating it again for practice. I was able to do it quite a bit faster the second time, with only two repetitions. I rechecked my pH meter several times over a period of about three weeks, and it seemed to stay in calibration; you should have similar results.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="bgblack">NOTE</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>As a preliminary test, I also used the test voltage circuit in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig10">Figure 7-10</a> to perform initial calibration. You will also need a digital voltmeter. I started with 0V and adjusted the offset potentiometer until the LCD showed a pH of 7. Next, I adjusted the test voltage circuit to output 180mV on my digital voltmeter and turned the scale potentiometer until the LCD showed a pH of 10. I then adjusted the test voltage to –180mV and adjusted the scale until the LCD showed a pH of 4. After only a couple of tries, I had good results, so I disconnected the test supply and replaced it with the probe. This time, I was able to calibrate the meter in only a single try</em>.</p>&#13;

<p class="boxtitle"><strong>IN AN ANALOG FRAME OF MIND</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Some of us dinosaurs still like analog readouts, and for those holdouts mired in the 20th century, I have included provisions in the schematics in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig6">Figures 7-6</a> and <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig7">7-7</a>, the sketch, and the final shield PCB file for using an analog readout. This was a bit of an afterthought and it’s optional, so the series resistor for the meter is not included in the shield; however, the Pro Mini pin connections to the readout are. The single required resistor can be mounted on the rear of the meter movement. In <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig11">Figure 7-11</a>, I simply connected the meter to the breadboard circuit.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f07-11.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch07fig11"/><em>Figure 7-11: The Custom pH Meter breadboard circuit, with both the digital display and a 20 mA meter movement</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I’ve collected analog meters and movements over the years; the meter pictured is a Simpson 20 mA meter movement. To drive the meter, I simply used the PWM (pulse-width modulation) output from pins 5 and 6 on the Pro Mini, hooked directly to the meter with a resistor in series. In the sketch, I centered the meter on 0V so it uses a positive and negative voltage.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_203"/>I ended up using a variable resistor to set the analog meter’s minimum and maximum to –420mV and +420mV, respectively. This eliminated the problem of attempting to set the gain and offset to match the digital readout. However, that in no way affects the accuracy of either readout, and the digital and analog readouts match. They also track identically through the entire pH range.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For many meters, the case can be removed to easily place a different scale, as has been done in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig11">Figure 7-11</a>. The face on this project’s meter was prepared with a laser printer to make the scale reflect pH value and show an mV scale for reference. A nice scale can be made using a drawing program such as Corel Draw or Adobe Illustrator, and you can purchase full sheets of adhesive-backed label stock to adhere it to the original meter plate. Just be careful not to damage the needle or movement in the process.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch07lev1sec10"><strong>About the Effects of Temperature</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Thus far, I have not addressed the issue of temperature, but a solution’s pH value is temperature-dependent, as illustrated in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig12">Figure 7-12</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f07-12.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch07fig12"/><em>Figure 7-12: How pH varies with temperature</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The effect of temperature on pH at or around room temperature (25°C) is nominal. In fact, according to the chart, the difference in pH from 25°C to 0°C would measure as little as half a pH unit at both pH extremes. At 100°C, however, the difference is more pronounced and could be as much as 1.5 pH units.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Given that information, the question becomes exactly how to handle the effect of temperature on pH.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec5"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_204"/><em><strong>Adding a Temperature Sensor</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The first step to address the effects of temperature is to include a temperature sensor in the circuit so the Custom pH Meter knows what the temperature is. One of the easiest and most widely used temperature sensors in Arduino land is the LM35, which according to the data sheet outputs a linear 10mV/°C at 25°C, with half-degree accuracy. You can see this sensor in the schematics in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig6">Figures 7-6</a> and <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig7">7-7</a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I hooked up the chip and included it in the sketch, but I was somewhat concerned about the accuracy. Unfortunately, I didn’t have a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) temperature standard to go by, so I compared the Arduino sensor readings to a glass scientific thermometer, a bimetal dial thermometer, and a Radio Shack digital thermometer. None of these agreed with each other or the Arduino.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec6"><em><strong>Checking Accuracy</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The obvious way to calibrate the temperature sensor was to check it against two temperature values I really knew: the freezing and boiling point (at sea level) of distilled water. Because I live about 12 feet above sea level, the altitude would not be a problem. The result of my ice water and boiling tests indicated that the sensor was indeed off by about 2 percent. This was probably due to something in the external circuitry, such as the reference voltage, and is compensated for in the sketch. The temperature IC and connections were protected in a heat-shrink tube to eliminate any moisture getting to the connections, as described in “<a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07lev1sec13">Construction</a>” on <a href="ch07.xhtml#page_211">page 211</a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">According to the manufacturer for the glass electrode I used in this project, the error caused by temperature can be calculated as follows:</p>&#13;
<p class="center">Error in pH = 0.003 × (Calibrated temperature − Current temperature) × (Neutral pH − Actual pH)</p>&#13;
<p class="indentb">For example, if the electrode is calibrated at room temperature (25°C) and is measuring a sample around pH 4 at around 5°C, you would calculate the error as follows:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">Calculate the temperature difference: 25°C – 5°C = 20°C</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">Calculate how far away from neutral the pH is: 7 pH – 4 pH = 3 pH</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent">The total error is: 0.003 × 20 × 3 = 0.18 pH.</p></li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p class="indent">As of this writing, I have not attempted to integrate the temperature reading into the sketch to adjust the pH automatically. The Custom pH Meter does, however, display the temperature on the LCD, so you can decide whether or not it’s worth adjusting. As you can see in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig12">Figure 7-12</a>, the effect is minimal and can easily be approximated from the chart or calculated with tests similar to mine.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Chances are that most of your measurements will be at or near room temperature. Temperature compensation is generally required only in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_205"/>severe environmental and industrial environments. If you are taking pH readings at extreme temperatures, you may want to include the formula in your sketch.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">The basic pH measurement functionality is straightforward: it reads an analog value from the analog output of the op-amp circuitry and feeds that value to an analog input pin of the Pro Mini. The pH and temperature are read every time the main loop runs and then stored in <code>pHvalue</code> and <code>tempC</code>, respectively. My first version of the sketch printed these directly to the LCD.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_208"/>But when I laid out the circuit on the breadboard and adjusted the components, I noticed that the output was a little jumpy. The pH value jumped around by two or three tenths of a pH unit, plus or minus some core value. For example, the reading might fluctuate from a pH of 4 to 4.1, then to 3.9 and back to 4.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec7"><em><strong>Smoothing the pH and Temperature Output</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">I went back to the drawing board. I played with the circuit, trying to find where the jumpiness was coming from, and failed to nail it down. Then, because the pH was unlikely to change quickly, I decided to average a few readings. While that stabilized the reading, the drawback was that the more samples I took, the slower the reading.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">However, I didn’t think that was a problem, as some expensive commercial pH meters I’ve used took some time to stabilize, very likely for the same reason. But there was still room for improvement.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Fortunately, there is a useful sketch on the Arduino website written by David Mellis and subsequently modified by Tom Igoe that uses an array to smooth a signal. (You can see the original sketch in full at <em><a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Smoothing/">https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Smoothing/</a></em>.) I used this example as a model to smooth out the pH voltage in this project’s sketch. I experimented with several different values and found that somewhere between 5 and 10 samples worked well. I set <code>numReadings</code> equal to 10, and that resulted in a minimal drag on stabilization period, smoothing things out fairly well. The sketch shown in this book stores the result after smoothing in the <code>average</code> variable, which is printed to the LCD at the end of the main loop. In addition, I continued to fine-tune the circuit, so the sketch required less and less averaging.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notice that the same smoothing technique has been employed in the part of the sketch that handles input from the temperature-sensing circuit. (The <code>average2</code> variable contains the smoothed temperature reading result.) This was necessary for the same reason smoothing was needed for the pH voltage: even the temperature sensor output was a bit jittery. My first suspicion was that perhaps the Arduino Pro Mini and its voltage reference was causing hiccups in both the pH and temperature voltages. However, I hooked the temperature sensor directly up to my multimeter with a well-filtered power supply and experienced the same disruptions. In the end, the smoothing approach solved the problem.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="bgblack">NOTE</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>While the smoothing approach used in this sketch worked well, that isn’t the only approach you could take. For example, a moving average approach could also work well</em>.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec8"><em><strong>Centering an Analog Meter</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">If you choose to use an analog meter, the Arduino will need to drive the positive and negative sides of the meter. The sketch maps the meter drive to reverse the PWM values on two pins as follows.</p>&#13;
<pre><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_209"/>meterdrive1 = map(average, 0, 14, 0, 255);<br/>meterdrive2 = map(average, 14, 0, 0, 255);</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">To obtain <code>meterdrive1</code>, the average value (the average of pH values measured) is mapped from 0 to 14, while <code>meterdrive2</code> is the same average value mapped from 14 to 0. Both mappings use the <code>map()</code> function from Arduino’s preloaded libraries.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The <code>map()</code> function is a useful tool that lets you map a number from one range to another. The syntax is as follows:</p>&#13;
<pre>map(<span class="codeitalic">value, fromLow, fromHigh, toLow, toHigh</span>)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">The <code>map()</code> function can be used to shift a set of values or, as in this case, to reverse the values going from 0, 14 and from 14, 0. If you want to use an analog meter and don’t want to reset the indicator to the center, you can simply use either output pin 5 or pin 6 (leave the one you don’t use open) and change the value of the resistor to result in a correct reading.</p>&#13;
<div class="box1">&#13;
<p class="boxtitle"><strong>A NOTE ON SIGNIFICANT FIGURES</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The following line of code prints the pH to the LCD, showing two decimal places:</p>&#13;
<pre>lcd.print(average,2); //Truncate to two decimal places</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">An earlier draft of the sketch called <code>lcd.print(average,1)</code> instead, showing only one decimal place, but when I was trying to minimize the jitter on the Custom pH Meter, I changed the display code to include two decimal places for finer granulation. For the most part, the pH reading remained extremely stable even to the second decimal place.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the final sketch, I kept two decimal places, but to be honest, I’m not sure how meaningful or accurate the second decimal place is. It has a slight tendency to drift as the probe sits in the solution, which I believe is normal. I dutifully researched and learned a lot more about <em>significant figures</em> (the digits in a measurement that actually have meaning) than I ever wanted to know, but I was still left without a definitive answer.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here’s the bottom line: all of the literature I perused regarding pH discussed pH in terms of integers—or at best, to the tenths position. Only in some references to scientific and industrial applications was the hundredths position even used at all.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For most practical applications, you can change the sketch to use a single significant digit if you prefer. I do also strongly recommend that you use only a single significant digit during preliminary calibration, as the additional digit could be confusing. If you must (as much for ego as anything), you can put the second significant digit back, but know that its accuracy is suspect and, in my experience, it doesn’t really buy you anything.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch07lev1sec12"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_210"/><strong>The Shield</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The Custom pH Meter shield, shown in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig13">Figure 7-13</a>, is designed to minimize noise from the pH probe to the input. The Pro Mini and the LCD in this project can generate a little electrical noise; thus, all of the active analog input components are at one end of the PCB, while the Pro Mini and interface to the display are at the opposite end of the board. The inverter IC and associated components are located under the Pro Mini to conserve space.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f07-13.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch07fig13"/><em>Figure 7-13: The shield PCB has headers soldered in place only for the pins this project uses on the Pro Mini. The voltage inverter and capacitors are located under where the Pro Mini will plug in</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For this project, I decided to use a double-sided circuit board. This made the PCB layout a lot simpler than trying to squeeze everything on one side, and it allowed the amplifier, buffer stage IC, and associated components to be arranged in close proximity. You can see the layout file for this shield, which you can download with the rest of this book’s resource files, in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig14">Figure 7-14</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f07-14.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch07fig14"/><em>Figure 7-14: The top traces in the shield layout are the darkest, the bottom traces are second darkest, and the silkscreen layer is the lightest. Notice that the silkscreen layer shows boxes around various components</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig15">Figure 7-15</a> shows the completed printed circuit board before and after population. When populating this board, make sure to take precautions to prevent static electricity damage to the TL072. Because of this chip’s very high input impedance, it is particularly sensitive to static discharge from handling. I used a socket to hold the op-amp so in case it got damaged, replacing it would not be a major job.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_211"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f07-15.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch07fig15"/><em>Figure 7-15: The shield PCB before and after population. The voltage inverter and associated components are under the Pro Mini. The populated version is shown with the display connected</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Also note that many resistors on this PCB are mounted vertically to save space and reduce lead length and circuit-board-trace lengths. I used 0.100-inch female headers to mount the Pro Mini, which leaves plenty of room for the components underneath. It is not necessary to fully populate the board with headers to fit all the Pro Mini’s pins; you just need enough to mechanically support the Pro Mini and provide the necessary electrical connections. I found it helpful to place headers at the very end of at least one side to align the pins and simplify my aim when plugging in the Pro Mini board.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch07lev1sec13"><strong>Construction</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Be sure the sketch is loaded onto the Arduino, and solder all components to your PCB now, including wires for power and ground and for the jack for the (optional) temperature sensor. Place the op-amp into its socket now as well, but bend pin 3 of the op-amp so that it sticks out. You will need to be able to access pin 3 in a later stage of the construction process.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When the Custom pH Meter circuit is soldered and the sketch is loaded onto the Arduino, only one step remains in terms of actual construction: putting everything inside a protective box. This section describes some suggestions for an enclosure and for how to mount the circuit board inside. <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig16">Figure 7-16</a> shows the finished enclosure.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_212"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f07-16.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch07fig16"/><em>Figure 7-16: The finished Custom pH Meter in the enclosure. This close-up illustrates the positioning of the holes for the offset (labeled</em> Ofst) <em>and gain (labeled</em> Scale) <em>calibration adjustments</em>.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec9"><em><strong>The Custom pH Meter Enclosure</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Your choice of enclosure will depend on how you want to use the Custom pH Meter, whether or not you elect to include an analog meter, and the level of portability required. I selected a standard ABS clear plastic box with outside measurements of approximately 1.3×2.45×4.4 inches. The space was somewhat tighter than I planned, but I was able to squeeze in the printed circuit board, display, switch, connectors, and battery.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch07lev3sec1"><strong>Making Room for the Display</strong></h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This project’s enclosure is a Hammond Manufacturing case, model 1591 BTCL. <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig17">Figure 7-17</a> shows a drawing of the top of the plastic box, marked with lines for cutting the display hole and drilling the mounting holes.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f07-17.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch07fig17"/><em>Figure 7-17: Template for the cover of the enclosure, showing an opening for the 16×2 display (shaded area) and where to drill mounting holes</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_213"/>You can download this drawing with this book’s resource files (see <em><a href="https://www.nostarch.com/arduinoplayground/">https://www.nostarch.com/arduinoplayground/</a></em>) and use it as a template for center punching the holes.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I needed as much vertical room as possible inside the enclosure to accommodate the battery, so cutting out the top of the enclosure was necessary. Be careful, though: some displays have slightly different footprints, so measure yours and check it against the drawing first. If there’s a discrepancy, adjust the measurements.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The ABS plastic the enclosure is made of cuts easily, so cutting out the display hole shouldn’t pose any major problems. Before you get started, clamp the enclosure securely to a piece of scrap wood attached to a workbench or table.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="bgblack">WARNING</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>When you use a relatively large bit to drill into a thin layer of ABS plastic, the bit will tend to grab the plastic. Do not hold the enclosure by hand</em>.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">To follow this template, first drill the two big holes in the opposing corners of the display area, using the punch marks as centers. I found 1/2 inches to be a good size for these holes, but just make them big enough to accommodate the saw blade you’re going to use to make the cutout. You may want to drill the centers of the 1/2-inch holes with a smaller drill first to make sure they are on center. Then, use a keyhole saw to cut out the smaller rectangle.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To make sure there is enough room for the battery, I suggest mounting the display off center, as shown in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig16">Figure 7-16</a>, with the measurements indicated in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig17">Figure 7-17</a>. When your display hole is cut, drill the smaller holes for mounting the LCD with a #30 or 1/8-inch drill to accommodate the 4-40 screws.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch07lev3sec2"><strong>Drilling Holes for Other Hardware</strong></h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Once the top is prepared, drill holes for the BNC connector (A), on/off switch (B), power input switch (C), and optional temperature jack (D) in the two smaller sides of the main body of the case, according to the template in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig18">Figure 7-18</a>. The hole for the BNC connector is 3/8 inches, while the holes for the switches and the temperature jack are all 1/4 inches.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f07-18.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch07fig18"/><em>Figure 7-18: Approximate layout for the holes for the BNC connector (A) on the left side of the enclosure, and the on/off switch (B), battery/AC switch (C), and optional 3.5 mm temperature sensor input jack (D) on the right side</em>.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec10"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_214"/><em><strong>Mounting the Circuit Board</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Finally, choose where to mount the printed circuit board to the inside of the case. For both pH meters that I made, I held a nonpopulated shield PCB inside the case and marked the locations of the four mounting holes on the plastic; you can use a printout of the board layout in this book’s resource files as a pattern if you prefer. With your four holes marked, gently center punch and drill them. Be careful not to crack the plastic enclosure, and make sure they line up with the mounting holes indicated on the PCB. I suggest using a #41 drill bit (about 3/32 inches) to drill these holes.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you use the shield design included with this book, you may also need to drill the circuit board’s mounting holes to the correct size. Conventional manufacturing practice would advise using a spacer, screw, and nut to hold the board inside the enclosure, but instead, I drilled and tapped the circuit board itself. I used a #50 bit to drill the circuit board in all four corners and tapped it with a 2-56 tap. I then used 2-56 screws to fasten the board in place. While this may not be a recommended practice for all applications, the board was light enough that it worked out well.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Furthermore, I would not expect a finished pH meter to be subjected to much physical punishment. With that in mind, I just put a strip of foam on the noncomponent side of the board and screwed the board to the side of the case—but not too hard. If you expect the unit to experience repeated and extreme vibration, you can put a dab of Thread-Lok or another anaerobic adhesive on the screw threads before assembly.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Once the board is mounted, mark the access holes for the gain and offset trimmers. Place the cover on the enclosure, look straight down through the cover, and use a Sharpie marker to mark the locations of the two trimmer access holes. Remove the top from the enclosure, and drill 1/4-inch holes corresponding to the screw heads on the trimmers (see <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig16">Figure 7-16</a>).</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec11"><em><strong>Installing the Other Hardware</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Now you can install the BNC connector, on/off switch, power switch, and (optional) temperature jack. I found it easiest to mount the switches and jack inside the enclosure first and solder the wires to them later. The same technique works well with the BNC connector, though you may wish to solder the ground wire beforehand. I took a piece of 22-gauge solid wire, wrapped it three-quarters of a turn around the base of the connector, tightened it with the retaining nut, and soldered it to a ground tap on the PCB (see <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig13">Figure 7-13</a>).</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="bgblack">NOTE</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>While I did not bring out the signals for the analog meter for my personal build, if you build the shield, you’ll see the two connections marked with a small box around them</em>.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch07lev3sec3"><strong>Connecting the Probe to the Op-Amp</strong></h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">“<a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07lev2sec1">Integrating the High-Impedance Probe</a>” on <a href="ch07.xhtml#page_193">page 193</a> describes special considerations required for using the pH probe as an input to the Custom <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_215"/>pH Meter. It turns out that even high-quality FR-4 circuit board material can cause some current leakage, from dirt or moisture on the surface or other contamination. To minimize leakage, connect the input from the IC directly to the probe. In order to do this, place the IC in close physical proximity to the BNC connector inside the case. Then, instead of soldering pin 3 of the op-amp to the board or plugging that pin into a socket, bend it out and wire it directly to the BNC connector (see <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig19">Figure 7-19</a>).</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f07-19.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch07fig19"/><em>Figure 7-19: To minimize spurious signals, the connection from the BNC connector to the IC pin is soldered directly</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Because this is the only high-impedance part of the circuit, some other precautions mentioned in the op-amp’s data sheet (such as ground-isolation rings around the other inputs) are not required. However, this project’s shield PCB does keep critical traces as short as possible and places components in close proximity.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch07lev3sec4"><strong>Connecting the Temperature Sensor</strong></h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">For the optional temperature sensor, you will need to mount a 3.5 mm three-conductor jack inside the enclosure; the drilling hole for this is marked D in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig18">Figure 7-18</a>. Wire this jack to the temperature IC connections on the PCB, which are the three holes between the display connections and regulator IC in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig20">Figure 7-20</a>. The sleeve of the connector is ground, the ring is positive, and the tip is the output of the temperature-sensing IC.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f07-20.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch07fig20"/><em>Figure 7-20: The three connections for the temperature sensing IC are just above the word</em> Therm.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can protect the IC itself from liquid immersion by encapsulating it in a short length of heat-shrink tubing with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_216"/>sealant, as shown in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig21">Figure 7-21</a>. This heat-shrink tubing is readily available online. The sealant on the inside of the tubing should make a completely waterproof seal for the IC. To seal the IC, just insert it into the tubing and heat with a heat gun or a hair dryer on high heat until it is completely sealed.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/f07-21.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch07fig21"/><em>Figure 7-21: This LM35 temperature IC is completely encapsulated in a short length of heat-shrink tubing with a sealant thermal gel. The thermal gel can barely be seen where the wires enter the tubing</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Once all hardware is mounted inside the enclosure and all components are soldered to the PCB, screw the LCD to the cover and close it all up to finish. You might also want to label your potentiometers and switches, as shown in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig16">Figure 7-16</a>, for ease of operation later.</p>&#13;

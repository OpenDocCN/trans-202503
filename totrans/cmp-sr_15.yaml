    but to make you feel safe by letting you know the kinds of threats that are out
    there and how to protect against them. Once you know how to do that, you should
    feel much more confident!

- en: One of the greatest threats you can encounter on your computer is a *virus*,
    a malicious app or program whose purpose is to attack your computer. There are
    many different viruses that do many different things—from stealing your passwords
    and bank details to trying to convince you to buy fake apps for your computer.
    You might also have heard the terms *malware, trojan, spyware*, and *worm*, but
    we’ll just call them all viruses. Luckily, there are things you can do to protect
    against the threat of viruses and to combat them if your computer gets infected.

    from an exhaustive list, here are some common signs of a virus:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*****   **Unexpected messages popping up on your computer, even when you’re
    not browsing the internet:** Sometimes viruses will even appear as a fake app
    or website asking you to pay money to remove other viruses from your computer!
    Be wary of pop-up messages from sites or programs you don’t recognize or trust.'

    viruses will interfere with your search results, redirecting you to (often unsavory)
    websites.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*****   **Unexpected credit card charges or money missing from your bank account:**
    Sometimes you’ll first find out that your computer has a virus via a phone call
    from the bank. Some viruses will try to steal credit card and bank details you’ve
    typed in on an infected computer.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*****   **Unexpected fake emails, Skype messages, or Facebook posts being sent
    from your computer to other people:** If your friends are telling you that they’ve
    received messages from you that you haven’t sent, you might have a virus. Viruses
    sometimes spread themselves by sending out these sorts of messages, and some will
    even use these messages to ask your friends to send you money, when it’s going
    to the virus creator.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*****   **Your computer is very slow or experiencing a lot of errors:** Some
    viruses will use your computer for their own purposes, slowing it down in the
    process. Of course, there are many, many reasons for a slow computer other than
    a virus, so don’t jump to conclusions based off this one symptom alone.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although this may sound scary, there are steps we can take to protect ourselves
    from viruses. Perhaps the most important tool available for staying safe online
    is an *antivirus app*, which will scan every file you open and every website you
    visit for signs of a virus. If it does find a virus or even suspects that something
    might be infected, it will prevent the program from running or the website from
    opening. An antivirus app can also scan your computer for viruses that are already
    present and remove any it finds.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many antivirus apps are available, some for free and some you need to pay for.
    You might have heard of antivirus apps such as Norton and McAfee, but here we’ll
    focus on Microsoft’s Windows Defender app, which is free and comes with Windows
    10\. Even if you’re using a different antivirus app, you can still run a scan
    with Windows Defender to give you a second opinion.

    a lottery you never entered or have been named the sole heir to a deceased Nigerian
    prince, or they might ask you for money for some urgent situation with the promise
    that they will pay you back in full—and then some.

    a small amount of money to cover customs duties, processing, fees, or some other
    type of expense. The scammers will then extract as much money as they can out
    of you before moving on. If you ever receive one of these emails, it’s best to
    delete it without responding, even if you have only the slightest suspicion that
    it’s a scam.

- en: 'Phishing attacks also usually come in the form of emails. In this attack, scammers
    typically send an email pretending to be from a legitimate company, like your
    bank, and try to get you to click a link in the email. That link will often take
    you to a website that’s a near exact replica of the real bank’s website, where
    they’ll ask for your login details. If you hand them over, the scammers will likely
    drain your bank accounts! Phishing emails pretending to be from a bank are some
    of the most common, but scammers will also try to impersonate your internet service
    provider; popular sites like Facebook, Amazon, eBay, and PayPal; or even the IRS!
    Phishing attacks are generally subtler than other types of scams and thus harder
    to identify. Here are some tips that can help you identify a phishing email:'

    from banks and other sites usually address you by name.'

    You would, for example, expect a real email from the Bank of America to come from
    an **[@bankofamerica.com](mailto:@bankofamerica.com)** email address. Therefore,
    if you receive an email from an **[@gmail.com](mailto:@gmail.com)** address claiming
    to be from the Bank of America, it’s probably a fake. Beware, though: it’s not
    always so easy to spot the difference. A fake email from **[@bankofannerica.com](mailto:@bankofannerica.com)**
    might look at first glance like it’s coming from the right place!'

- en: '*****   **Poor spelling and grammar:** Many phishing emails are sent from countries
    where English isn’t the primary language, so they often contain spelling and grammatical
    errors. Real companies usually proofread their emails, so any mistakes are a possible
    sign of a phishing email.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*****   **Urgent language:** Many phishing emails will try to pressure you
    into responding by including language such as “your account will be disabled if
    this isn’t completed within 24 hours.” A real bank probably wouldn’t email you
    about something that important, but would phone you instead!'
  prefs: []

    without replying. Under no circumstances should you do as the email instructs.
    If you’re unsure, try contacting the company the email claims to be coming from
    on the telephone and asking whether they sent it. We encourage you to take a look
    at *[http://www.sonicwall.com/phishing/](http://www.sonicwall.com/phishing/)*

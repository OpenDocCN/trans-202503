<p class="ChapterIntro">Every day of their working lives, DevOps engineers immerse themselves in cloud-based trends and technologies. Meanwhile, everyone else in engineering is expected to be familiar with DevOps and keep pace with how it is evolving. The reason is simple: DevOps is an integral part of software development. However, you probably don’t have time to both do your day job and keep tabs on the ever-changing landscape of DevOps—and luckily, you don’t have to. Just gain an understanding of the foundational concepts, terms, and tactics of DevOps, and you’ll go far.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xvi" id="Page_xvi"/>On the other hand, when it comes time to deliver code, you can’t just put your head in the sand and hope someone else will deal with it. Writing configuration files, enforcing observability, and setting up continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines have become the norm in software development. You therefore need to be well versed in code and infrastructure.</p>
<p>If you’re a software engineer, developer, or systems administrator, this book will teach you the concepts, commands, and techniques that will give you a solid foundation in DevOps, reliability, and modern application stacks. But be aware that this is an introduction to DevOps, not a definitive guide. I’ve chosen to keep the knowledge fire hose turned down low, and I’ll focus on the following foundational concepts:</p>
<ol class="none">
<li>Infrastructure as code</li>
<li>Configuration management</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Containerization and orchestration</li>
<li>Delivery</li>
<li>Monitoring and alerting</li>
<li>Troubleshooting </li>
</ol>
<p>Plenty of other great books will take you on a deep dive into the concepts and culture of DevOps. I encourage you to read them and learn more. But if you just want to get started with the basics, <em>DevOps for the Desperate</em> has you covered.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502482f06-0001">What Is the Current State of DevOps?</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Over the past few years, different trends have emerged in DevOps. There is a heavy focus on microservices, container orchestration (Kubernetes), automated code delivery (CI/CD), and observability (detailed logging, tracing, monitoring, and alerting). These topics aren’t new to the DevOps community, but they’re gaining more attention because everyone has swallowed the red pill and gone down the cloud-and-containerization rabbit hole.</p>
<p>Automating and testing the “code to customer” experience is still one of the most important parts of DevOps, and it will continue to be as late adopters play catch-up. As engineering ecosystems mature, more and more DevOps work is occurring higher up the tech stack. In other words, DevOps engineers are heavily relying on tools and processes so software engineers can self-serve shipping code. Because of this, sharing DevOps practices and techniques with feature teams is paramount to delivering standardized and predictable software.</p>
<p>A few more emerging trends are worth a brief mention here. The first is security. DevSecOps is becoming an essential part of the build process rather than a post-release afterthought. Another trend is the use of machine learning for data-driven decisions like alerting. Machine learning insights can be extremely useful in heuristics and will play a larger role going forward. </p>
<h2 id="h1-502482f06-0002"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xvii" id="Page_xvii"/>Who Should Read This Book?</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">This book is aimed at helping software engineers feel at home and thrive in a modern application stack. As such, it provides just the right amount of introductory information about DevOps tasks. This is not to say it has nothing to offer established DevOps engineers. On the contrary, it provides plenty of useful information about containerization, monitoring, and troubleshooting. If you are a DevOps engineer or software engineer in a small shop, you can even use this book to help you create your whole application stack, from local development to production. </p>
<p>So, if you’re a software developer looking for knowledge about DevOps, this book is for you. If you’re interested in becoming more of a generalist, this book is for you. And if I’ve paid you money to read this book—well, this book is definitely for you. </p>
<h2 id="h1-502482f06-0003">How This Book Is Organized</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">This book is divided into three parts, as follows: </p>
<h3 id="h2-502482f06-0001">Part I: Infrastructure as Code, Configuration Management, Security, and Administration</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Part I introduces the concepts of infrastructure as code (IaC) and configuration management (CM), which are essential for building systems with a repeatable, versioned, and predictable state. We’ll also explore host-based and user-based security.</p>
<ol class="none">
<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 1: Setting Up a Virtual Machine </span>  This chapter discusses the concepts of IaC and CM. It then introduces two technologies, Vagrant and Ansible, that you’ll use to create and provision an Ubuntu VM. </li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 2: Using Ansible to Manage Passwords, Users, and Groups </span>  This chapter looks at how to use CM for user and group creation to restrict file and directory access. It also explains how to use CM to enforce complex passwords.</li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 3: Using Ansible to Configure SSH </span>  This chapter shows you how to set up public key and two-factor authentication over SSH, thus making it harder for unauthorized users to gain access to your host and sensitive data.</li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 4: Controlling User Commands with sudo </span>  This chapter shows you how to create a security policy that delegates command access for a specific user and group. Controlling the command access that users and groups have on a host can help you avoid unnecessary exposure to attackers. At a minimum, it prevents you from having a poorly configured OS.</li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 5: Automating and Testing a Host-Based Firewall </span>  This chapter describes how to create and test a minimal firewall that will block all unwanted access while permitting approved traffic. By limiting port exposure, you can reduce the vulnerabilities your host and application may encounter from the outside.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="h2-502482f06-0002"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xviii" id="Page_xviii"/>Part II: Containerization and Deploying Modern Applications</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Part II introduces the concepts of containerization, orchestration, and delivery. It also explores some of the components that make up a modern stack.</p>
<ol class="none">
<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 6: Containerizing an Application with Docker </span>  This chapter introduces containers and containerization, and it shows how to create a sample containerized application. Having a basic understanding of containers and how to use them for local development and production is key to your ability to work with any modern application stack.</li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 7: Orchestrating with Kubernetes </span>  This chapter introduces container orchestration and explores how to use technologies like Kubernetes and minikube to deploy an application on a local cluster. It also serves as an example of how to set up a local development environment.</li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 8: Deploying Code </span>  This chapter discusses the concept of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). It also explores some core technologies, like Skaffold, that allow you to create a pipeline on a local Kubernetes cluster. After building an effective CI/CD pipeline, you’ll have a good understanding of how to build, test, and deploy software.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="h2-502482f06-0003">Part III: Observability and Troubleshooting</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Finally, Part III introduces the concepts of monitoring, alerting, and troubleshooting. It looks at metric collection and visualization for applications and hosts. It also discusses some common host and application issues, as well as tools you can use to diagnose them.</p>
<ol class="none">
<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 9: Observability </span>  This chapter introduces the concept of a monitoring and alerting stack, and it explores the technologies (Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana) that make up this stack. You’ll learn how to detect a system’s state and alert on it when things are out of scope.</li>
<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 10: Troubleshooting Hosts</span>  The last chapter discusses common issues and errors on a host and some tools you can use to troubleshoot them. Being able to analyze issues on a host will help you in times of crisis and help you understand performance issues in your own code and applications.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="h1-502482f06-0004">What You’ll Need</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">In order to explore the DevOps concepts in this book, you’ll install some tooling and the free VirtualBox virtualization technology for x86 hardware that allows you to run other operating systems on your local host. Unfortunately, some of the tools needed for these tasks won’t work natively on some OSes and CPUs, such as Windows and Apple Silicon. Using Linux <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xix" id="Page_xix"/>or an Intel-based Mac as the host machine is the most straightforward option. The following list summarizes what you can expect for each OS: </p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Linux</b></p>
<ol class="none">
<li>If you’re on a Linux host, all the examples and sample applications will work out of the box. Since you’ll be installing VirtualBox, you’ll want to be running a desktop version of Linux rather than a headless server.</li>
</ol>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Intel-based Mac </b></p>
<ol class="none">
<li>If you’re running an Intel-based Mac, as with Linux, all the examples and sample applications will work without any modifications. Use the Brew package manager (<a href="https://brew.sh" class="LinkURL">https://brew.sh</a>) to install software.</li>
</ol>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Windows </b></p>
<ol class="none">
<li>If you’re on a Windows host, installing all the tools and applications in this book can be a challenge. For example, you’ll use Ansible to explore configuration management, but there’s no easy way to install Ansible on Windows. As a workaround, you can use an Ubuntu VM as your starting point. I recommend creating the VM with Hyper-V, since it’s native to Windows. You’ll need Windows 10 or 11 Pro to use Hyper-V. See the Ubuntu Wiki (<a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Hyper-V" class="LinkURL">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Hyper-V</a>) for instructions on creating an Ubuntu VM on Hyper-V.
<p class="ListBody">You’ll also need to enable nested virtualization since you’ll be installing VirtualBox inside the Hyper-V Ubuntu VM. To enable this feature, enter the following command in an administrative PowerShell terminal:</p>
<pre><code><code class="bold">Set-VMProcessor -VMName </code><var class="bold">VMName</var><code class="bold"> -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $true</code></code></pre>
<p class="ListBody">You’ll need to run this command when the Ubuntu VM is stopped, or it will fail. Replace <var>VMName</var> with the name of the Ubuntu VM you just created. </p>
<p class="ListBody">After your VM is up and running, you’ll install VirtualBox using the Ubuntu version listed at <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads" class="LinkURL">https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads</a>. After completing that installation, you’ll be able to perform the book’s examples from within the newly created VM.</p>
<p class="ListBody">For older versions of Windows, you can use VirtualBox (yes, VirtualBox within VirtualBox) or VMware (<a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html" class="LinkURL">https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html</a>) to create the Ubuntu VM. Instructions for these options are beyond the scope of this book.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Apple Silicon </b></p>
<ol class="none">
<li>If you’re using an Apple Silicon computer as your host machine, VirtualBox is not an option. Apple Silicon’s CPU is based off the ARM architecture, and VirtualBox works only on x86. Instead, you’ll need <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xx" id="Page_xx"/>to use a virtualization technology like Parallels (<a href="https://parallels.com" class="LinkURL">https://parallels.com</a>), VMware Fusion (<a href="https://vmware.com" class="LinkURL">https://vmware.com</a>), or Qemu (<a href="https://www.qemu.org" class="LinkURL">https://www.qemu.org</a>) to create an ARM-based virtual machine. The first two options are paid software and may provide a better user experience. Qemu is free and open source, and it requires some extra configuration steps. Visit the companion GitHub repository (<a href="https://github.com/bradleyd/devops_for_the_desperate/tree/main/apple-silicon/" class="LinkURL">https://github.com/bradleyd/devops_for_the_desperate/tree/main/apple-silicon/</a>) for detailed instructions on how to set up a suitable lab to follow along on your Apple Silicon Mac.</li>
</ol>
<p>To get the best experience, your host should have a minimum of 8GB of memory and at least 20GB of free disk space available; your mileage might vary if you have less. This book also makes some basic assumptions about your comfort level with Linux and the command line. You should be familiar with Bash and feel at home editing files.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502482f06-0004">Downloading and Installing VirtualBox</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Download the installer from <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads/" class="LinkURL">https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads/</a>. Choose the latest version and the correct download for your specific operating system. As mentioned previously, Windows users using Hyper-V will install VirtualBox for Ubuntu Linux. For Intel-based Macs, click the OS hosts link and download the installer. For Linux, you guessed it—click the Linux distributions link to find the download for your distribution. The VirtualBox website has excellent instructions for the different OSes at <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/" class="LinkURL">https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/</a>.</p>
<p>Launch VirtualBox from where you installed it to verify that it works. If everything is okay, you should be greeted with a start screen (see Figure 1).</p>

<section class="note">
<span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xxi" id="Page_xxi"/><h2><span class="NoteHead">WARNING</span></h2>
<p>	If you are running macOS, you’ll need to allow VirtualBox extra permissions when trying to launch the virtual machine. You will be prompted to allow VirtualBox to control your computer, and you should go ahead and do so.</p>

<h3 id="h2-502482f06-0005">Companion Repository</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">As this is a book for the desperate, I have taken the liberty of creating IaC files, Kubernetes manifests, an example application, and other things that will help you follow along throughout. I have put all the examples and source code in a Git repository located at <a href="https://github.com/bradleyd/devops_for_the_desperate.git" class="LinkURL">https://github.com/bradleyd/devops_for_the_desperate.git</a>. To follow along with the chapters and examples, you’ll need to clone the book’s repository. Your OS should have Git installed by default, but if it does not, visit <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" class="LinkURL">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a> for information on how to download and install Git for your specific OS.</p>
<p>From your terminal, enter the following command to clone the companion repository:</p>
<pre><code>$ <b>git clone https://github.com/bradleyd/devops_for_the_desperate.git</b></code></pre>
<p>Feel free to clone this repository to anywhere you like. I have added some information in the <em>README</em> file as well if you need any additional guidance. We’ll revisit this repository throughout this book.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502482f06-0006">Editor</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Throughout this book, you’ll need to edit and view files to complete tasks. For example, in some of the Ansible files, I’ve either left portions commented out that you’ll need to uncomment, or you’ll need to fill in some missing information. </p>
<p>I recommend using any editor you are comfortable with. You won’t need any special plug-in or dependency to follow along in this book. However, if you look hard enough, I am sure you can find syntax plug-ins to help with editing the different types of files, like Ansible and Vagrant manifests. I use Vim as my editor, but feel free to substitute your favorite.</p>
<p>And now, with all the background out of the way, you are ready to get started! In <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 1">Chapter 1</span>, we’ll dive into setting up a local virtual machine.</p>

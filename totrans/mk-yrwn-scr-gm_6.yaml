    weird? Don’t worry—that’s normal. Maybe you’re saying, “I don’t *feel* like a
    game designer yet,” but this book can’t hear you. It doesn’t have ears.

- en: It’s easy to feel like you’re not qualified to call yourself something, because
    labels are tricky. Some game designers work in big teams, and everyone contributes
    a small part of the finished game. Other game designers sit in their bedrooms
    making fun things on their computer. Still other game designers go to the park
    to play catch with friends and come up with different ways of playing, such as
    saying “What if we have to toss the ball under our leg?” or “What if we’re not
    allowed to touch the ball with our hands?” There are loads of different ways to
    be a game designer.

    on a cool fact about game design: if you’re doing it right, it should always be
    a bit of a challenge. Even people who’ve designed games for years still ask questions:
    “What if you can only move one space every day?” “What kind of game can you play
    at a protest?” “Why don’t games let you make friends with the monsters instead
    of fighting them?”'

    thing. Maybe they need to work together to steer a giant robot (one player controls
    the legs while the other player controls the arms). Or maybe your game could be

    In Scratch’s keyboard **Sensing** block, the arrow keys are at the very top of
    the list. But if you have access to video game consoles, how could you move a
    character using the controller? There’s probably either a d-pad with arrows or
    a stick that can point in different directions.
  prefs: []

- en: Just because people usually do things one way doesn’t mean it’s the only way
    to do it (or even the best way!). A controller can look like anything. If you
    made a game about learning to walk in a strange, new robot body, would it make
    sense for the controls to be familiar? The way we control a game is part of the
    game’s experience. Try to imagine controls that match what the game’s experience
    is supposed to be.

    the experience of using a keyboard or mouse. What about a game where the player’s
    been shrunk? Instead of being next to each other, the keys for moving around can
    be far across the keyboard from each other. You can make an overlay for the keyboard
    that has holes for just those keys.'

- en: Or how about a game where the player tries to get around a space station in
    zero gravity by pushing off the walls and ceiling? You could hang the mouse in
    the center of a cardboard box (its cord dangling through a hole in the top) so
    the player needs to find somewhere on the side or top of the box to move the mouse
    against. It would be a game about a mouse, controlled using the mouse, and you
    could put little ears on the computer mouse so it looks like a real mouse. The
    possibilities are limited only by your arts and crafts supplies!

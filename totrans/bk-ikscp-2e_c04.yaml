    book is devoted to various types of objects, their properties, and techniques
    for working with them. However, regardless of type, all Inkscape objects have
    a lot of things in common.

- en: An object is just a thing somewhere on the canvas—a part of your drawing. Of
    course, it's not always that simple; what looks like a separate object may be
    either a part of some other object or a combination of several objects. Identifying
    individual objects takes experience and effort.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Inkscape has a number of dialogs for manipulating properties of objects, but
    only one of them is generic enough to be called simply Object Properties (accessible
    by pressing Shift-Ctrl-O, from the right-click menu on the object, or from the
    Object menu). Select ([Chapter 5](c05.xhtml#ch5)) a single object to view its
    properties, as shown in [Figure 4-1](#fig4-1).

- en: The *identifier* (ID field) of an object is the `id` attribute of the corresponding
    element in the SVG source of the document ([Appendix A](b01.xhtml#chA)). Its value
    is always unique within the document; Inkscape provides unique IDs for all objects
    automatically, but you can change this value so long as it remains unique.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Assigning meaningful names to objects is a useful approach to organizing complex
    artwork. The ID is not the best way to do this, however; per XML rules, you can
    use only a very limited set of characters in element IDs—no spaces, only Latin
    letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, and dots. For a more human-friendly alternative,
    use the object's Label (it corresponds to the `inkscape:label` extension attribute
    in SVG). It can be of any length, use any characters whatsoever, and need not
    be unique.

- en: The Hide and Lock checkboxes control the locked and hidden status of the selected
    object. A *locked* object is visible, but most selection methods cannot select
    it, so it cannot be changed. A *hidden* object is both invisible *and* unselectable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I do not recommend hiding or locking individual objects. You may find yourself
    in a trap where you need to select an object to unlock or unhide it—but you cannot
    because it is hidden or locked. Specifically for such situations, the Object menu
    contains two commands, Unhide All and Unlock All, that will reveal and make selectable
    all objects in the current layer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's much more convenient to act on the layer containing the objects you want
    to hide or lock. Hiding and locking via layers is not only faster (affects multiple
    objects at a time), it's also easier—even if it's locked or hidden, you can always
    access any layer (via the Layers dialog, see [4.9.4](#section4.9.4)) to change
    its status.

    size in the familiar rectangular coordinate system with a horizontal X axis and
    a vertical Y axis.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In Inkscape, the coordinate origin is always in one of the corners of the page
    frame ([2.3](c02.xhtml#section2.3)). Older versions of Inkscape placed the coordinate
    origin in the bottom left corner of the page, with Y values increasing upward.
    However, the SVG standard places the origin in the top-left corner, with Y values
    increasing downward (X values always increase to the right), and more recently
    Inkscape made this the default in its UI as well. You can still switch it to the
    old (and frankly more natural) bottom-left origin on the Interface page of Preferences
    ([3.1](c03.xhtml#section3.1)); just remember that this affects only the UI—when
    editing your document's SVG code (for example, in Inkscape's XML Editor,[4.10](#section4.10)),
    all coordinates assume the origin in the top-left corner.
  prefs: []

- en: The rulers at the edge of your canvas area are one way to measure the coordinates
    (press Ctrl-R to reveal them if they are hidden). As you move your mouse over
    the canvas, small triangular markers on the rulers reflect its current position.
    Also, the X and Y coordinates of the mouse pointer are always displayed on the
    right end of the status bar, just before the zoom field marked Z ([Figure 4-2](#fig4-2)).

    ([Figure 4-3](#fig4-3)). This rectangle is the visual representation of what is
    called the *bounding box* of the object—the smallest possible rectangle that completely
    encloses the object. The bounding box is always upright—that is, its sides are
    parallel to the coordinate axes; if you rotate an object, its bounding box may
    or may not change its size, but it won't rotate with the object. (Switch to Selector
    and rotate the ellipse by pressing the square bracket keys, [ and ].)

    depending on the coordinate origin preference, [4.2](#section4.2)); the W and
    H give the width and height of the bounding box. If multiple objects are selected,
    the values reflect the bounding box of the entire selection. You can change the
    unit of measurement of these fields in the drop-down menu on the right; initially,
    it's set to the document unit ([3.5.1](c03.xhtml#section3.5.1)).

    visible* about the object—most notably its entire stroke ([9.1](c09.xhtml#section9.1))
    but also markers ([9.5](c09.xhtml#section9.5)) and filter margins ([17.5.4](c17.xhtml#section17.5.4)).

    An object on top in the z-order may obscure those below it, if they overlap and
    if the top object is not transparent. The term *z-order* implies a third coordinate
    axis, Z, imagined to extend perpendicular to the X/Y plane of the drawing toward
    the viewer. Objects higher in the z-order are thus "closer" to the viewer.'

    each new one will be drawn on top of the previous ones, as shown in [Figure 4-4](#fig4-4).

    all the way to the top or bottom of the layer, correspondingly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another thing to remember is that all z-order commands work only *within the
    layer*. If you have several layers in your document, these layers form their own
    z-order, and an object in a lower layer can never be on top of an object in a
    layer above. For rearranging the z-order of layers, use the layer commands described

    in the same position on the canvas. This is equivalent to copying and then pasting
    in place, except that Duplicate does not change the contents of your clipboard.

    transform a selection (move, scale, rotate, or skew) by dragging the mouse in
    the Selector tool (see [2.7](c02.xhtml#section2.7)), you can press spacebar to
    leave behind a copy of the selection without interrupting the interactive transformation.
    For example, if you grab and drag an ellipse and then press and hold the spacebar
    while dragging, the object being moved will leave a trail of its copies on the
    canvas. Stamping also works in the Node tool when you drag a selection of nodes

    tool, click any object in a group, and the entire group gets selected. In this
    sense, a group is a "saved selection." After selecting, it is easy to move, scale,
    or paint the group just as you would a number of separate selected objects.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, grouping is a natural way to *organize complex artwork*. When you have
    thousands of objects in your drawing, sorting out what belongs together is difficult.
    One way to structure such complex documents is via layers, as discussed later
    in this chapter. Often, however, layers are too much hassle—for example, if you
    just want to ensure that the nose and the eyes in your portrait are never accidentally
    moved relative to each other, the easiest way to do that is by grouping them together.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    otherwise. One such effect is *group transparency* (see [8.3](c08.xhtml#section8.3)
    for more on transparency).
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the individual objects, as shown in [Figure 4-10](#fig4-10).

    now, the checkered background shows through, but the overlapping area of the rectangle

    has its own place in the z-order stack of your document, and all the members of
    the group share its z-order position.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This means that if object A is on top of B, and B is on top of C, you cannot
    group A and C without changing the z-order. If you attempt to do that, C will
    jump up on top of B, and you will have a group containing A and C lying on top
    of the object B.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ungrouping, in that case, will not restore the original z-order. If you ungroup
    the "A and C" group, you will have three independent objects, but they will be
    now in the order A, C, B (top to bottom). (Of course, if you simply Ctrl-Z to
    undo right after grouping, both grouping and the z-order change will be reverted.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the same reason, you cannot group objects from different layers. Both layers
    and groups are branches of the XML tree of the document, and you cannot have a
    branch (group) growing from more than one parent branch (layer). If you try to
    group objects selected in different layers or within different groups, Inkscape
    will complain (with a message in the status bar) and do nothing.

    or rearrange.'
  prefs: []

    object belongs to, just select that object and look at the status bar. It will
    say something like Rectangle in layer Layer 1; here, Layer 1 is the name of the
    layer. You can, of course, select objects from different layers, in which case
    the status bar will say, for example, 2 objects in 2 layers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the layers in the document is always *current*. Any new objects you create,
    paste, or import are added to the current layer. To make layers in complex drawings
    easier to work with, Inkscape's current layer *follows selection*. That is, if
    you are in layer A and select some objects in layer B (for example, by clicking
    it), layer B becomes your new current layer. Conversely, if you change the current
    layer, your selection is deselected.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Inkscape remembers the current layer when saving the document and restores it
    when you load it afterward. A new document template (see [3.2](c03.xhtml#section3.2))
    usually contains one initial layer called Layer 1; it is current when you load
    the template—so, if you don't create any new layers, all your objects will end
    up in Layer 1.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just like individual objects, layers may be locked or hidden. In a*locked* layer,
    objects are visible but cannot be selected. In a *hidden* layer, objects are both
    invisible and cannot be selected. You cannot add new objects to a layer that's
    either hidden or locked.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Typically, layers are hidden when you want to simplify a complex piece of artwork
    to concentrate on some parts of it. Hiding complex layers may speed up screen
    redraw considerably and thus make working more comfortable. Locking layers is
    useful when you want some background objects to be visible but not selectable—usually
    to make it easier to select the foreground objects by clicking or dragging around
    them.

  prefs: []

    This is useful for organizing complex artwork. Instead of a flat list of layers,
    you may have a hierarchical tree, where related layers are grouped by a common

    the entire branches of the tree instead of individual layers one by one.

    choose **Enter group** from the pop-up menu.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    transform, style, view its bounding box, and so on) with the advantages of layers
    (a layer defines a context that you can comfortably work in—for example, by adding
    new objects to it). In particular, the easiest way to move some object *into*
    an existing group without ungrouping is to cut the object (Ctrl-X), enter the
    group, and paste the object there (Ctrl-V, or Ctrl-Alt-V if you want to preserve

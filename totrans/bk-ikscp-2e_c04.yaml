    book is devoted to various types of objects, their properties, and techniques
    for working with them. However, regardless of type, all Inkscape objects have
    a lot of things in common.

    course, it's not always that simple; what looks like a separate object may be
    either a part of some other object or a combination of several objects. Identifying
    individual objects takes experience and effort.

    only one of them is generic enough to be called simply Object Properties (accessible
    by pressing Shift-Ctrl-O, from the right-click menu on the object, or from the
    Object menu). Select ([Chapter 5](c05.xhtml#ch5)) a single object to view its
    properties, as shown in [Figure 4-1](#fig4-1).

    element in the SVG source of the document ([Appendix A](b01.xhtml#chA)). Its value
    is always unique within the document; Inkscape provides unique IDs for all objects
    automatically, but you can change this value so long as it remains unique.

- en: Assigning meaningful names to objects is a useful approach to organizing complex
    artwork. The ID is not the best way to do this, however; per XML rules, you can
    use only a very limited set of characters in element IDs—no spaces, only Latin
    letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, and dots. For a more human-friendly alternative,
    use the object's Label (it corresponds to the `inkscape:label` extension attribute
    in SVG). It can be of any length, use any characters whatsoever, and need not
    be unique.

    in a trap where you need to select an object to unlock or unhide it—but you cannot
    because it is hidden or locked. Specifically for such situations, the Object menu
    contains two commands, Unhide All and Unlock All, that will reveal and make selectable
    all objects in the current layer.

    to hide or lock. Hiding and locking via layers is not only faster (affects multiple
    objects at a time), it's also easier—even if it's locked or hidden, you can always
    access any layer (via the Layers dialog, see [4.9.4](#section4.9.4)) to change

    frame ([2.3](c02.xhtml#section2.3)). Older versions of Inkscape placed the coordinate
    origin in the bottom left corner of the page, with Y values increasing upward.
    However, the SVG standard places the origin in the top-left corner, with Y values
    increasing downward (X values always increase to the right), and more recently
    Inkscape made this the default in its UI as well. You can still switch it to the
    old (and frankly more natural) bottom-left origin on the Interface page of Preferences
    ([3.1](c03.xhtml#section3.1)); just remember that this affects only the UI—when
    editing your document's SVG code (for example, in Inkscape's XML Editor,[4.10](#section4.10)),
    all coordinates assume the origin in the top-left corner.

    called the *bounding box* of the object—the smallest possible rectangle that completely
    encloses the object. The bounding box is always upright—that is, its sides are
    parallel to the coordinate axes; if you rotate an object, its bounding box may
    or may not change its size, but it won't rotate with the object. (Switch to Selector

    transform a selection (move, scale, rotate, or skew) by dragging the mouse in
    the Selector tool (see [2.7](c02.xhtml#section2.7)), you can press spacebar to
    leave behind a copy of the selection without interrupting the interactive transformation.
    For example, if you grab and drag an ellipse and then press and hold the spacebar
    while dragging, the object being moved will leave a trail of its copies on the
    canvas. Stamping also works in the Node tool when you drag a selection of nodes
    ([12.5.7](c12.xhtml#section12.5.7)).

    the two toggle buttons on the left, indicates whether that layer is hidden (the
    eye button) and/or locked (the lock button), as shown in [Figure 4-12](#fig4-12).

    Hidden layers' names are gray. A temporary layer (such as a group that you entered,
    [5.10](c05.xhtml#section5.10)) uses italics for its name.

    space on screen. However, it is adequate only if your layer structure is small
    and simple. In more complex documents, it quickly becomes unwieldy. That's when
    you need to use the Layers dialog (Shift-Ctrl-L), shown in [Figure 4-14](#fig4-14).

    slider controls let you set the opacity or blur level of the entire current layer.

    layers, rearrange them, or set the blend mode ([17.2](c17.xhtml#section17.2)),
    blur, and opacity levels for any layer or an individual object. You can toggle
    the visible (V column) and locked (L) status of any object, and you can convert
    groups to layers and back (click the icon in the T column for a group or layer).
    The dialog also marks objects that are clipped or masked (CM) and lets you choose
    the color of the path highlight (HL) that this object—if it's a path—will have
    in the Node tool ([12.5.1](c12.xhtml#section12.5.1)).

    editors. This is where you can see the entire raw source of your document, with
    nothing hidden or (mis)interpreted. Simply put, if something is not shown in the
    XML Editor, it's not in your document.

    the objects or properties of your document, the XML Editor is the tool for you.
    Here, you can do absolutely anything to your document. I might even say that XML
    Editor is the only essential part of the program, everything else being optional
    conveniences!

    change in the XML Editor.

    or vertically (with the toggle in the bottom-right corner). You can also hide
    the attributes pane with the Show attributes switch, bottom left.

- en: This pane shows the entire tree of the document you are editing. Each node of
    the tree (each line in this list) is either an XML element or a text node. In
    SVG, text nodes are used only for holding the text content of text objects; all
    other objects are element nodes. For example,`svg:rect` is a rectangle, and `svg:g`
    is either a group or a layer (here, `svg` is the namespace prefix; see [A.2](b01.xhtml#sectionA.2)).
    Of all the attributes a node might have, this pane only shows the `id` attribute
    (which is unique, so it's a natural way to tell nodes of the same type apart).

    things (such as metadata) that you don't see on the canvas. For more on various
    SVG and Inkscape elements, refer to [Appendix A](b01.xhtml#chA).

- en: In the document tree, you can select any element by clicking it. This list selection
    is synchronized with the regular object selection in Inkscape. If the selected
    node corresponds to a visible object, that object gets selected on the canvas;
    conversely, when you select an object on canvas, the XML tree pane scrolls to
    the corresponding node and highlights it. This is one way to reach elements that
    are otherwise inaccessible, such as those that are locked or hidden ([4.1](#section4.1)).

- en: 'Above the tree pane, there''s a small toolbar with buttons for generic XML
    operations: creating a new element or text node and duplicating or deleting the
    selected node. The last four buttons are for moving the selected node (and its
    children) in the tree. You can shift a node sideways to change the nesting level
    (the left arrow button converts a node from a child of its parent to its sibling;
    the right arrow button converts a node into a child of its preceding sibling)
    or use the up/down arrows to move a node among its siblings. You can also rearrange
    nodes by dragging them within the tree.'

    of a table. The order of the attributes does not matter in XML.

    If the existing value is too long to fit on one line, a convenient little window
    pops out where you can edit the auto-wrapped value. (This is typically the case
    for `style` attributes; however, see [8.1](c08.xhtml#section8.1) for a more convenient
    way to edit an object's style properties.) Pressing Enter accepts the changes.

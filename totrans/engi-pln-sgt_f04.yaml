- en: In mid-2009, as the world was just escaping the most severe economic meltdown
    since the 1930s, I was escaping university with an undergraduate liberal arts
    degree and not a single prospect for gainful employment. Rather than take my chances
    in the dreadful job market, I decided to spend a little more time (and a lot more
    money) on my education. Facing the difficult reality that a university degree
    could not guarantee a job, I diligently cross-referenced my various interests
    against their occupational prospects to refocus my career path in a more dependable
    and less ambiguous direction. I settled on civil engineering, a subject about
    which I knew almost nothing but that seemed both exciting and responsible. Incredibly,
    I was accepted into my top choice for graduate school and started my studies that
    fall.

    up to my graduate-level classmates, I began the engineering coursework. I have
    always been generally curious about science, technology, and how things work.
    Still, nothing could have prepared me for the remarkable transformation of perspective
    I would receive during the rest of my studies. Structural design classes had me
    staring at every beam and column to be spotted in each new building I visited.
    Circuits labs pointed out the details and complexities of electric transmission
    lines and substations. Stormwater engineering lectures compelled me to notice
    every drain, manhole, channel, and detention basin while biking or driving around
    town. Each and every class was like turning on a lamp to illuminate some innocuous
    part of the constructed environment that I had never noticed before. I was captivated.

    looking at the world. It didn’t take long for that enthusiasm and excitement about
    infrastructure to overflow into my personal life, including my hobby YouTube channel.
    What started as a way to share my woodworking projects with other makers and craftspeople
    slowly turned into an outlet for introducing topics in engineering to the world.
    Now I produce educational videos full-time, and *Practical Engineering* has millions
    of viewers each month.

- en: Even the most unexceptional parts of the built environment are monuments to
    the solutions to hundreds of practical engineering problems. Understanding even
    a small subset of those challenges and their resolutions had the power to instill
    astonishment and wonder in me, and I never stopped feeling that way. Now my entire
    life is essentially a treasure hunt for all the interesting little details of
    the constructed world. My spontaneous stops at each dam and bridge for a photograph
    or a better look drive my wife a little crazy on road trips. I regularly lose
    my train of thought on walks when noticing some new or different piece of infrastructure.
    And there is a tiny part of my brain that is dedicated—no matter where I am or
    what I’m doing—to following the path that stormwater will take as it runs off
    along the ground. Engineering opened my eyes to the infrastructure that surrounds
    and supports our modern lives. If any of that eagerness comes across in this book,
    I have succeeded.

- en: This is not a comprehensive field guide. Infrastructure takes a myriad of shapes
    and forms that vary around the world. This book focuses on the United States,
    but constructed works can look quite different even between states, counties,
    and cities. It wouldn’t be practical to try to document them all. Plus, it would
    ruin the fun. Part of the joy of “infrastructure spotting” is using your detective
    skills to deduce the purpose of random bits and bobs as you come across them.
    I hope what follows can ignite that joy and further your journey as an enthusiastic
    beholder of the constructed environment.

- en: The most direct way to produce parametric 3D objects is through manipulating
    2D sketches. In the last chapter, you produced a cube by extruding a square. In
    this chapter, you’ll learn how to use the Revolve feature to produce a spherical
    object from a sketch, then practice tying features together by smoothing them
    out with fillets and chamfers.

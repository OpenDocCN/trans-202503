    measures that we put in place to protect our people, equipment, and facilities.
    In most places, you’ll find physical security measures such as locks, fences,
    cameras, guards, and lighting. In higher-security environments, you might also
    notice iris scanners, mantraps (an access control that requires you to step through
    two locking doors to enter a building, similar to a phone booth with two entrances),
    or identification badges equipped to store certificates.

    in September 1947, when someone discovered a moth shorting two connections in
    a system together, causing the system to malfunction. When workers removed the
    moth, they described the system as having been debugged.[⁵](notes.xhtml#ch09fn5)
    You can see the actual “bug” in question in [Figure 9-5](#ch9fig5).

    the property. Minimal measures might control vehicle traffic to make sure it doesn’t
    enter undesirable places. For example, this can take the form of *security landscaping*,
    which can include trees, large boulders, and cement planters, placed in front
    of buildings or next to driveways to prevent vehicle entry. More secure facilities
    might also have fences, concrete barriers, and other more obvious measures. Such
    controls are generally deterrents but may be preventive, as well.

    them for business reasons. You may also find more complex physical access controls
    in place in such areas, such as biometric systems.

    who might violate your security, detective measures alert you to potential intrusions,

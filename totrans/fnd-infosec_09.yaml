    measures that we put in place to protect our people, equipment, and facilities.
    In most places, you’ll find physical security measures such as locks, fences,
    cameras, guards, and lighting. In higher-security environments, you might also
    notice iris scanners, mantraps (an access control that requires you to step through
    two locking doors to enter a building, similar to a phone booth with two entrances),
    or identification badges equipped to store certificates.

    conditions is crucial to continued operations. Computing equipment can be sensitive
    to changes in power, temperature, and humidity, as well as electromagnetic disturbances.
    In areas with large quantities of equipment, maintaining the proper conditions
    can be challenging, to say the least.

    electrical power, like generators, as well as systems that can heat, cool, and
    moderate the humidity as required. Unfortunately, these controls are expensive,
    and smaller facilities might not be appropriately equipped.

- en: In this chapter, you learned how to mitigate physical security issues using
    deterrent, detective, and preventive measures. Deterrents aim to discourage those
    who might violate your security, detective measures alert you to potential intrusions,
    and preventive controls physically prevent intrusions from taking place. None
    of these controls is a complete solution by itself, but together, they can put
    you on stronger footing.

    you can generally replace data and equipment, you can’t replace people. One of
    the best ways to protect them is to remove them from dangerous situations quickly.
    You can also implement a variety of administrative controls to keep them safe
    in their working environments.

    Make sure your data is available when you need it and that it’s completely deleted
    when you no longer need it. Ensure its availability by keeping backups, whether
    by using RAID to protect against storage media failures or with removable devices,
    such as DVDs or magnetic tape.

- en: Protecting your equipment, although the lowest of your priorities, is still
    a vital task. When selecting the location of your facility, consider relevant
    threats and take steps to mitigate them. Take the necessary steps to secure access
    to and within your facility. Lastly, maintain the environmental conditions appropriate
    for your equipment.

			<p class="ChapterIntro">In a parallel universe, preparing for disasters could be like shopping for car insurance: a boring necessity taken care of in a day and then duly forgotten for another year. Here in our dimension, that’s most certainly not the case. For many preppers, what starts as a cautious inquiry into a fringe subculture soon morphs into a passion that influences most other aspects of life.</p>
			<p>For some, the allure of prepping lies in the intellectual thrill of conducting complex thought experiments. For others, it’s about the connections made with like-minded hobbyists on the internet. And for a small minority, the fascination is rooted in a darker impulse: the conviction that the world is rotten and deeply unjust, and that it’s only a matter of time before the deception is laid bare and everything spirals out of control.</p>
			<p>
				Whatever the motivation, the existence of a vibrant and driven community provides fertile ground for peddlers of doomsday goods. From camouflage clothing to custom-designed backyard bunkers, there’s no <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_48" title="48"/>limit to how much a fearful prepper can spend. Yet, buying more stuff never offers closure. As soon as one shipment arrives, the doomsayer celebrities on YouTube come up with another “tactical” and “mil-spec” essential to add to the cart.</p>
			<p>I believe that such fear-driven consumption isn’t a game worth playing. It’s much healthier to look at emergency preparedness as having a Plan B just in case, rather than putting the apocalypse smack dab in the middle of your Plan A. Any expenditure of time, money, or mental energy on survival strategies must be balanced against the impact it will have on your normal life.</p>
			<p>This isn’t to say that there’s no room for survival tools in a comprehensive preparedness plan. In due time, we’ll examine topics ranging from the value of an extra jug of water to the merits of firearms. But in an attempt to break with the tired formulas of the genre, I want to devote the second part of this book to lifestyle adaptations that don’t involve spending a single penny on specialized prepper equipment or learning how to skin deer. Much of the content in the next couple of chapters revolves around topics that are considered unbecoming of any hard-boiled survivalist, from personal finance to staying safe online. But what this advice lacks in glamour, it should make up for in utility and depth.</p>

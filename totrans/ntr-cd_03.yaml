    nearly 2,000 years old. It stated that if an object is moving, some sort of force
    is required to keep it moving. Unless that moving thing is being pushed or pulled,
    it will slow down or stop. This theory was borne out through observation of the
    world. For example, if you toss a ball, it falls to the ground and eventually
    stops moving, seemingly because the force of the toss is no longer being applied.
  id: totrans-17

- en: This older theory, of course, isn’t true. As Newton established, in the absence
    of any forces, no force is required to keep an object moving. When an object (such
    as the aforementioned ball) is tossed in Earth’s atmosphere, its velocity changes
    because of unseen forces such as air resistance and gravity. An object’s velocity
    will remain constant only in the absence of any forces or only if the forces that
    act on it cancel each other out, meaning the net force adds up to zero. This is
    often referred to as **equilibrium** (see [Figure 2.1](ch02.xhtml#ch2fig1)). The
    falling ball will reach a terminal velocity (which stays constant) once the force
    of air resistance equals the force of gravity.

    would include separate cases for static friction (a body at rest against a surface)
    and kinetic friction (a body in motion against a surface), but for simplicity

    for each of these approaches. I’d like to at least discard the first one, since
    I tend to prefer an object-oriented approach rather than an arbitrary function
    not tied to either the `Mover` or `Attractor` class. Whether you pick option 2
    or option 3 is the difference between saying, “The attractor attracts the mover”
    and “The mover is attracted to the attractor.” Option 4 is really my favorite,

    the examples are clearer continuing with the same technique of using this method

    force. Can you create an example in which all the `Body` objects are attracted
    to the mouse but repel one another? Think about how you need to balance the relative
    strength of the forces and how to most effectively use distance in your force
    calculations.

    the canvas in a pattern that resembles a spiral galaxy? You may need to include
    an additional large body in the center to hold everything together. A solution
    is offered in my “Mutual Attraction” video in the Nature of Code series on the
    Coding Train website (*[https://thecodingtrain.com/nbody](https://thecodingtrain.com/nbody)*).

    (for example, water versus mud, or the current of a river) affect the way a character
    moves through an ecosystem?

    creature to interact with. Does the creature experience attraction or repulsion
    to things in its world? Can you think more abstractly and design forces based
    on the creature’s desires or goals?

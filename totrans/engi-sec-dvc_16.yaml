    practitioners with a useful, practical overview of embedded system security that
    would help them navigate the jungle of possible threats, protection measures,
    security marketing, and complete despair. Well, here we are. If you belong to
    one of those groups and have made it to this point, I’m convinced you’ve discovered
    new territory, probably learned something useful, and maybe even identified your
    next personal challenge.

  zh: 当我决定写这本书时，我的目标是为学生和从业者提供一本有用的、实用的嵌入式系统安全概述，帮助他们在各种威胁、保护措施、安全营销和完全绝望的丛林中找到出路。好吧，我们走到了这里。如果你属于这两个群体之一并已经读到这里，我相信你已经发现了新的领域，可能学到了有用的东西，甚至可能找到了下一个个人挑战。
- en: If you’ve already transferred the topics of this book into your day-to-day job
    and brought them to life in the specific embedded system on your desk, you can
    be proud of yourself. It was probably all but trivial and required tireless effort.
    However, don’t celebrate just yet. This is only the beginning of your security
    journey. It’s not the end of the story. Industries like pay-TV, automotive, and
    gaming consoles have already learned that if there is something large enough to
    gain, attackers will do whatever it takes to find it.

  zh: 如果你已经将本书中的主题转化为日常工作，并在你桌面上的特定嵌入式系统中付诸实践，你可以为自己感到自豪。这可能并非易事，且需要不懈的努力。然而，现在还不是庆祝的时候。这仅仅是你安全之旅的开始，并不是故事的结局。付费电视、汽车和游戏主机等行业已经意识到，只要有足够大的利益可图，攻击者会不惜一切代价找到它。
- en: During the last two decades, the topic of *side-channel analysis* slowly found
    its way out of the academic arena and into select industries. These attacks exploit
    physical characteristics like runtime, power consumption, or electromagnetic emission
    of crypto algorithms and other protection measures to extract information about
    secrets and intermediate values processed within a microchip. Although this approach
    requires specialized knowledge and suitable hardware and software, it has already
    been practically applied to pay-TV systems, electronic locks, and automotive components,
    just to name a few.

  zh: 在过去的二十年里，*侧信道分析*这一话题逐渐从学术领域走向了某些特定行业。这些攻击利用了加密算法和其他保护措施的物理特性，如运行时间、电力消耗或电磁辐射，来提取关于秘密和微芯片内处理的中间值的信息。尽管这种方法需要专门的知识以及适当的硬件和软件，但它已经在付费电视系统、电子锁和汽车组件等领域得到了实际应用，仅举几个例子。

    a set of countermeasures and protected implementations to choose from.

- en: 'Stefan Mangard, Elisabeth Oswald, and Thomas Popp wrote *Power Analysis Attacks:
    Revealing the Secrets of Smart Cards* (Springer, 2007) as one of the first books
    in the field, if you’re interested in the foundations of this topic. Additionally,
    *The Hardware Hacking Handbook* (No Starch Press, 2021) by Jasper van Woudenberg
    and Colin O’Flynn (this book’s technical reviewer) contains a variety of practical
    examples for good and bad implementations, and provides tips to enhance your personal
    side-channel analysis skills.'

  zh: 斯特凡·曼加德、伊丽莎白·奥斯瓦尔德和托马斯·波普撰写了*《功耗分析攻击：揭示智能卡的秘密》*（Springer，2007），这是该领域的第一本书之一，如果你对该主题的基础知识感兴趣，可以参考。此外，贾斯珀·范·沃登贝格和科林·奥弗林（本书技术审阅者）所著的*《硬件黑客手册》*（No
    Starch Press，2021）包含了多种好的和不好的实现实例，并提供了提升个人侧信道分析技能的技巧。
- en: Another powerful class of threats are *fault injection* attacks that use voltage
    or clock glitches, electromagnetic pulses, or even laser beams to intentionally
    force microchips to jump over instructions or process corrupted data. Does it
    sound like science fiction? Such attacks obviously require adversaries with sophisticated
    knowledge and professional equipment, but they have already been performed on
    several gaming consoles in practical settings—for example, to circumvent firmware
    authenticity verification during a secure boot process. Afterward, attackers were
    able to boot and execute their custom software on those devices. Again, a practical
    introduction to the topic including real-world examples can be found in *The Hardware
    Hacking Handbook*.

  zh: 另一类强大的威胁是*故障注入*攻击，这些攻击通过电压或时钟故障、电磁脉冲，甚至激光束，故意迫使微芯片跳过指令或处理损坏的数据。听起来像科幻小说吗？这些攻击显然需要具备高水平知识和专业设备的对手，但它们已经在一些游戏主机上在实际环境中实施过——例如，在安全启动过程中绕过固件认证验证。之后，攻击者能够在这些设备上启动并执行他们自定义的软件。同样，关于这个话题的实际介绍，包括现实世界的例子，可以在*《硬件黑客手册》*中找到。
- en: In addition to advanced attacks on the hardware level, rising complexity on
    the software level leads to an increased attack surface. Therefore, *secure software
    segmentation* of applications with varying criticality is another follow-up security
    topic for complex software architectures on devices. For example, some products
    already implement virtualization or container technologies to separate user-defined
    software from a manufacturer’s system applications. And suddenly, threats like
    applications breaking out of their restricted environments, which we know from
    cloud systems, become absolutely relevant for embedded systems. In addition, devices
    aiming for rather high security might move critical software applications to dedicated,
    secure execution environments, such as ARM TrustZone. But this also requires hardware
    support, a specific firmware architecture, and significant implementation expertise,
    all of which contribute to system complexity and facilitate further attack vectors.
    In short, you won’t ever grow bored.

  zh: 除了对硬件层面的高级攻击外，软件层面的复杂性上升也导致了攻击面增加。因此，针对具有不同重要性的应用程序进行*安全软件分段*，是复杂软件架构中设备的另一个后续安全话题。例如，一些产品已经实现了虚拟化或容器技术，将用户定义的软件与厂商的系统应用程序隔离开来。突然间，像应用程序突破其受限环境这样的威胁——我们在云系统中也见过——变得对嵌入式系统来说同样相关。此外，旨在提供较高安全性的设备可能将关键软件应用迁移到专用的安全执行环境中，如ARM
    TrustZone。但这也需要硬件支持、特定的固件架构以及大量的实施经验，这些都增加了系统复杂性，并为进一步的攻击向量提供了便利。简而言之，你永远不会感到无聊。

    require magical powers. All you need are engaged, motivated, and clever people
    who work together as a team. Go for it!'

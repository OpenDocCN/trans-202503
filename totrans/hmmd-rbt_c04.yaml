- en: Solder is a fusible metal alloy used to make permanent electrical connections
    between wires and other electronic components. If you really want to dive deep
    into robotics, eventually you’ll need to learn to solder. By using solder that
    melts under relatively low temperatures of a few hundred degrees, you can join
    two pieces of metal together and create an electrical bond. This requires both
    a particular set of tools and a number of safety precautions.

    Although you can spend hundreds of dollars on a fancy soldering iron, a $15 adjustable
    iron (rated for about 60 W) should suffice to get started.

    after each use. Two commonly available options are wire pads, which tend to last
    longer, and slightly dampened sponges, which you should be able to find around
    your house. Use whichever you prefer.

    solder. It melts at a slightly higher temperature than lead solder and is a bit
    harder to work with, but it’s not as toxic to handle. At the end of the day, your
    health should take priority over ease of use.

    your lungs. When melted, solder releases nasty fumes that you should avoid breathing
    in. It is best to use a filtered exhaust fan while soldering. At the very least,
    solder in a place with decent airflow blowing away from you to prevent the exhaust
    fumes from lingering.

    way as you would hold a pencil, but with a very important exception. Instead of
    grasping the soldering iron near the tip, your hand should always grasp the insulated

    melt solder. You can test that it’s ready simply by touching the tip to some solder
    and seeing if it melts. If it does, you are ready to begin soldering. Also, while
    you are at it, turn on your exhaust fan, and make sure that you have the solder
    and soldering iron cleaning pad on hand.

    ends off of two sections of wire and twist or hook the metallic ends together.
    Next, heat up the metal ends of the wires while pushing a piece of solder into
    the joint. The solder should liquify and spread over the joint, fusing the two
    together. If done correctly, the joint should look silver and shiny without any
    black patches or bulbous bits of solder protruding from it.

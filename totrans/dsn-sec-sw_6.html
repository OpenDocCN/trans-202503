<p class="ChapterIntro">Terminology that is specific to software security may seem straightforward, but nuances are important to get right. I have evolved the following security-specific meanings of terms based on my experience across multiple companies and many diverse projects, and while these definitions are generally accepted, don’t be surprised if you find diversity in the terminology used in the wild. If you pay close attention, you’ll notice that security specialists define and use the same terms in slightly different ways, bringing their own unique perspectives to the foundational precepts of the field. Expect to hear many variations, because there is no accepted standard vocabulary; usually, however, these variations are easy to deduce in context. </p>

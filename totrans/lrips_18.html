another delivery immediately. This telescope would be the last, but Laurie still wondered how on
Earth they fit into Winsome’s plan.</p><p>“Some things in life you just have to see for yourself!” Winsome said with a
smile.</p><p>Laurie found it hard to argue with the excitement in Winsome’s voice, so she just
trusted the usual set of odd directions to lead her to an answer. Before long, she and Xor reached
an enormous tree. A long, twisty staircase wrapped around the trunk and up into the leaves, and a
young woman stood at the base.</p><p>“Hello, Laurie! Glad you made it. My name is Ping Baudot. I’ve been waiting for
you.”</p><p>“Hello. Wait, how did you know my name?”</p><p>“Oh, Fresnel told me all about you.”</p><p>“Fresnel? He lives way over on Elegant Island!”</p><p>“Yes, isn’t it wonderful? You and Winsome have been making lots of deliveries
lately. The Network is getting quite big now! I can hardly keep up with all the
chatter.”</p><p>“But I don’t—”</p><p>“You should be very proud. Here, let me help you with that.” Ping took the package
and raced up the stairs, round and round the trunk of the tree. Laurie followed as best she
could.</p><p>When they arrived at the treehouse near the top, Laurie gasped in surprise. It was a tree
<span class="emphasis"><em>lighthouse</em></span>! Not only that, but the lighthouse keeper’s room was filled
with telescopes pointing in all directions. A neat label was attached to each one.</p><p>“Well? What do you think?” Ping said.</p><p>“Why do you need so many telescopes?” Laurie asked.</p><p>“See for yourself.”</p><p>Laurie put an eye to the ‘scope labeled ELEGANT. A red, round splotch was hanging in the
air. And was that a rope?</p><p>“Hey, that’s Fresnel’s balloon! I can see him! He’s waving!”
Laurie exclaimed.</p><p>Laurie looked into other telescopes. Each one was pointed at a different lighthouse. The one
for ABSTRACT showed the lighthouse keeper who didn’t say very much, up in his tall white tower
by the sea, looking back through a telescope of his own. He didn’t wave. The BYZANTIUM
telescope showed half a pyramid covered in giant mechanical turtles. Bruto was busy counting
bricks.</p><p>Ping put down the heavy package Laurie had delivered and released the latches. Inside was a
squat telescope. “Excellent! I’ve been waiting for this.”</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00050a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00050"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="figs/web/133fig01.png.jpg"/></div></div><p>“It’s for the Network, right? Will you show me how it works?” Laurie
asked.</p><p>“Of course,” Ping said. “Watch this.” She went to the middle of the
room and turned a giant wheel until a red arrow pointed directly at Elegant Island. Then she pulled
a lever up and down quickly:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>FLOP. FLOP. FLIP. FLOP. FLIP.</p><p>FLOP. FLIP. FLIP. FLOP. FLOP.</p></blockquote></div><p>“Now look at Fresnel again,” she said.</p><p>Laurie put her eye to the Elegant Island telescope. Fresnel had pointed
<span class="emphasis"><em>his</em></span> light at <span class="emphasis"><em>them</em></span> and began blinking a message:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>FLOOSH. FLOOSH. FLASH. FLOOSH. FLASH.</p><p>FLOOSH. FLASH. FLASH. FLOOSH. FLOOSH.</p></blockquote></div><p>“He answered back! What did he say?” Laurie asked.</p><p>“Oh, he just said ‘hi.’”</p><p>“All that just for ‘hi’?”</p><p>“That’s how the Baudot Code works,” said Ping. “Sentences are made of
words, and words are made of letters, right? In the same way, we make <span class="emphasis"><em>letters</em></span>
out of FLIPs and FLOPs. Like this.”</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>01001 = L</p><p>11000 = A</p><p>10011 = U</p><p>01010 = R</p><p>01100 = I</p><p>10000 = E</p></blockquote></div><p>“That’s pretty neat! But I still think it’s a lot of work just to say
‘hi.’” Laurie said.</p><p>“Maybe you’re right,” Ping said, smiling. “But now that the hard work
of building the Network is finished, we can do something <span class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> interesting:
use the Network to make itself better.”</p><p>“How do you do that?”</p><p>“Well, I’m working on a way to use two colors of lights. Fresnel has an idea for a
simpler Code that uses only four FLIPs or FLOPs, though I’m not too sure how that will work.
We use the old Baudot Code to talk to each other about our ideas for new codes, and then try them
out.”</p><p>“So . . . you can use the Network to talk about how to use the Network?”</p><p>“And you helped make it possible, Laurie, by delivering all of those telescopes. Now,
the Network will only get better and better as we learn how to use it. We can already pass a message
from one end of the Network to the other in just a few minutes! Even the
<span class="emphasis"><em>Doppelganger</em></span> takes a couple of days to deliver the mail that far. Everyone will
want to use it once we work out the bugs.”</p><p>“But . . . what about Winsome? Is she going to lose her job?” Laurie asked.</p><p>“What? No, not at all! The Network was her idea.”</p><p>“It was?”</p><p>“Sure! All of us work for Winsome. She doesn’t want to spend her days hauling mail
bags around. That reminds me,” Ping said, searching through a pile of paper, “Winsome
says she has one more job for you.”</p><p>“Oh! What is it?” Laurie asked.</p><p>“She wants you to deliver this letter to a person on the other side of the Garden of
Forking Paths.”</p><p>There was no name on the envelope, but that wasn’t half as strange as some of the
assignments Laurie had been given in her time on the <span class="emphasis"><em>Doppelganger</em></span>. If she got
it done quickly, she could come back here and play with the Network. “So how do I get to the
Garden?”</p><p>“You’re in a hurry, huh? I’ll show you where it is.”</p></div></body></html>

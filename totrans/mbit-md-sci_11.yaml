- en: The projects in this book use a lot of parts, and unfortunately, there is no
    one supplier that has all of them. If you find a project you want to build or
    an experiment you want to try, carefully look through the “What You’ll Need” section
    and make a note of the things you don’t have. This will be your shopping list.

    name or description, and you’ll usually find somewhere you can buy it.

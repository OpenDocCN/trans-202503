<p class="noindent">When I decided to write this book, I set out to provide students as well as practitioners with a useful, practical overview of embedded system security that would help them navigate the jungle of possible threats, protection measures, security marketing, and complete despair. Well, here we are. If you belong to one of those groups and have made it to this point, I’m convinced you’ve discovered new territory, probably learned something useful, and maybe even identified your next personal challenge.</p>
<p class="indent">If you’ve already transferred the topics of this book into your day-to-day job and brought them to life in the specific embedded system on your desk, you can be proud of yourself. It was probably all but trivial and required tireless effort. However, don’t celebrate just yet. This is only the beginning of your security journey. It’s not the end of the story. Industries like pay-TV, automotive, and gaming consoles have already learned that if there is something large enough to gain, attackers will do whatever it takes to find it.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_240"/>During the last two decades, the topic of <em>side-channel analysis</em> slowly found its way out of the academic arena and into select industries. These attacks exploit physical characteristics like runtime, power consumption, or electromagnetic emission of crypto algorithms and other protection measures to extract information about secrets and intermediate values processed within a microchip. Although this approach requires specialized knowledge and suitable hardware and software, it has already been practically applied to pay-TV systems, electronic locks, and automotive components, just to name a few.</p>
<p class="indent">However, if you have to face such powerful attackers, you’re not lost. You have a set of countermeasures and protected implementations to choose from.</p>
<p class="indent">Stefan Mangard, Elisabeth Oswald, and Thomas Popp wrote <em>Power Analysis Attacks: Revealing the Secrets of Smart Cards</em> (Springer, 2007) as one of the first books in the field, if you’re interested in the foundations of this topic. Additionally, <em>The Hardware Hacking Handbook</em> (No Starch Press, 2021) by Jasper van Woudenberg and Colin O’Flynn (this book’s technical reviewer) contains a variety of practical examples for good and bad implementations, and provides tips to enhance your personal side-channel analysis skills.</p>
<p class="indent">Another powerful class of threats are <em>fault injection</em> attacks that use voltage or clock glitches, electromagnetic pulses, or even laser beams to intentionally force microchips to jump over instructions or process corrupted data. Does it sound like science fiction? Such attacks obviously require adversaries with sophisticated knowledge and professional equipment, but they have already been performed on several gaming consoles in practical settings—for example, to circumvent firmware authenticity verification during a secure boot process. Afterward, attackers were able to boot and execute their custom software on those devices. Again, a practical introduction to the topic including real-world examples can be found in <em>The Hardware Hacking Handbook</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to advanced attacks on the hardware level, rising complexity on the software level leads to an increased attack surface. Therefore, <em>secure software segmentation</em> of applications with varying criticality is another follow-up security topic for complex software architectures on devices. For example, some products already implement virtualization or container technologies to separate user-defined software from a manufacturer’s system applications. And suddenly, threats like applications breaking out of their restricted environments, which we know from cloud systems, become absolutely relevant for embedded systems. In addition, devices aiming for rather high security might move critical software applications to dedicated, secure execution environments, such as ARM TrustZone. But this also requires hardware support, a specific firmware architecture, and significant implementation expertise, all of which contribute to system complexity and facilitate further attack vectors. In short, you won’t ever grow bored.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite all that, always remember one point: engineering secure devices doesn’t require magical powers. All you need are engaged, motivated, and clever people who work together as a team. Go for it!</p>

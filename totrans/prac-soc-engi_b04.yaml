    try posing as a confused fellow employee, calling an internal number, and asking
    the target if they can access a few sites and resources; tell them you cannot
    access a certain site and then ask if they can. Alternatively, call the company
    as if you were a person interested in working for it. Leverage your “community
    college classes” to segue into asking about IT.

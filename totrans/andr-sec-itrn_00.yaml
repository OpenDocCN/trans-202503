- en: In a relatively short period of time, Android has become the world’s most popular
    mobile platform. Although originally designed for smartphones, it now powers tablets,
    TVs, and wearable devices, and will soon even be found in cars. Android is being
    developed at a breathtaking pace, with an average of two major releases per year.
    Each new release brings a better UI, performance improvements, and a host of new
    user-facing features which are typically blogged about and dissected in excruciating
    detail by Android enthusiasts.

- en: One aspect of the Android platform that has seen major improvements over the
    last few years, but which has received little public attention, is security. Over
    the years, Android has become more resistant to common exploit techniques (such
    as buffer overflows), its application isolation (sandboxing) has been reinforced,
    and its attack surface has been considerably reduced by aggressively decreasing
    the number of system processes that run as root. In addition to these exploit
    mitigations, recent versions of Android have introduced major new security features
    such as restricted user support, full-disk encryption, hardware-backed credential
    storage, and support for centralized device management and provisioning. Even
    more enterprise-oriented features and security improvements such as managed profile
    support, improved full-disk encryption, and support for biometric authentication
    have been announced for the next Android release (referred to as *Android L* as
    I write this).

- en: As with any new platform feature, discussing cutting-edge security improvements
    is exciting, but it’s arguably more important to understand Android’s security
    architecture from the bottom up because each new security feature builds upon
    and integrates with the platform’s core security model. Android’s sandboxing model
    (in which each application runs as a separate Linux user and has a dedicated data
    directory) and permission system (which requires each application to explicitly
    declare the platform features it requires) are fairly well understood and documented.
    However, the internals of other fundamental platform features that have an impact
    on device security, such as package management and code signing, are largely treated
    as a black box beyond the security research community.

- en: One of the reasons for Android’s popularity is the relative ease with which
    a device can be “flashed” with a custom build of Android, “rooted” by applying
    a third-party update package, or otherwise customized. Android enthusiast forums
    and blogs feature many practical “How to” guides that take users through the steps
    necessary to unlock a device and apply various customization packages, but they
    offer very little structured information about how such system updates operate
    under the hood and what risks they carry.

- en: This books aims to fill these gaps by providing an exploration of how Android
    works by describing its security architecture from the bottom up and delving deep
    into the implementation of major Android subsystems and components that relate
    to device and data security. The coverage includes broad topics that affect all
    applications, such as package and user management, permissions and device policy,
    as well as more specific ones such as cryptographic providers, credential storage,
    and support for secure elements.

- en: It’s not uncommon for entire Android subsystems to be replaced or rewritten
    between releases, but security-related development is conservative by nature,
    and while the described behavior might be changed or augmented across releases,
    Android’s core security architecture should remain fairly stable in future releases.

- en: This book should be useful to anyone interested in learning more about Android’s
    security architecture. Both security researchers looking to evaluate the security
    level of Android as a whole or of a specific subsystem and platform developers
    working on customizing and extending Android will find the high-level description
    of each security feature and the provided implementation details to be a useful
    starting point for understanding the underlying platform source code. Application
    developers can gain a deeper understanding of how the platform works, which will
    enable them to write more secure applications and take better advantage of the
    security-related APIs that the platform provides. While some parts of the book
    are accessible to a non-technical audience, the bulk of the discussion is closely
    tied to Android source code or system files, so familiarity with the core concepts
    of software development in a Unix environment is useful.

    API。尽管本书的部分内容适合非技术性读者，但大部分讨论与 Android 源代码或系统文件密切相关，因此对 Unix 环境中软件开发核心概念的了解将非常有帮助。

  zh: 前提条件
- en: The book assumes basic familiarity with Unix-style operating systems, preferably
    Linux, and does not explain common concepts such as processes, user groups, file
    permissions, and so on. Linux-specific or recently added OS features (such as
    capability and mount namespaces) are generally introduced briefly before discussing
    Android subsystems that use them. Most of the presented platform code comes from
    core Android daemons (usually implemented in C or C++) and system services (usually
    implemented in Java), so basic familiarity with at least one of these languages
    is also required. Some code examples feature sequences of Linux system calls,
    so familiarity with Linux system programming can be helpful in understanding the
    code, but is not absolutely required. Finally, while the basic structure and core
    components (such as activities and services) of Android apps are briefly described
    in the initial chapters, basic understanding of Android development is assumed.

    Android 子系统之前简要介绍。大部分平台代码来自核心 Android 守护进程（通常是 C 或 C++ 实现）和系统服务（通常是 Java 实现），因此至少熟悉其中一种语言是必需的。某些代码示例涉及
    Linux 系统调用的序列，因此熟悉 Linux 系统编程对于理解代码可能有帮助，但并非绝对必要。最后，虽然本书在最初几章简要描述了 Android 应用程序的基本结构和核心组件（如活动和服务），但假定读者对
    Android 开发有基本了解。

- en: The description of Android’s architecture and implementation in this book (except
    for several proprietary Google features) is based on source code publicly released
    as part of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). Most of the discussion and
    code excerpts reference Android 4.4, which is the latest publicly available version
    released with source code at the time of this writing. The master branch of AOSP
    is also referenced a few times, because commits to master are generally a good
    indicator of the direction future Android releases will take. However, not all
    changes to the master branch are incorporated in public releases as is, so it’s
    quite possible that future releases will change and even remove some of the presented
    functionality.

    earlier) was announced shortly after the draft of this book was completed. However,
    as of this writing, the full source code of Android L is not available and its
    exact public release date is unknown. While the preview release does include some
    new security features, such as improvements to device encryption, managed profiles,
    and device management, none of these features are final and so are subject to
    change. That is why this book does not discuss any of these new features. Although
    we could introduce some of Android L’s security improvements based on their observed
    behavior, without the underlying source code, any discussion about their implementation
    would be incomplete and speculative.

    access, and data analytics—all contribute to a variety of needs and challenges
    across nearly every industry. To put it simply, most modern products need some
    kind of computer integrated into them. More specifically, they usually require
    an *embedded system*, which means an electronic system including a processing
    unit, memory, and input/output interfaces that are embedded within a larger mechanical
    or electronic system.

- en: The application domains of embedded systems are extremely wide. They’re used
    in controllers, sensors, and actuators in industrial automation, transportation,
    and critical infrastructure systems. Communication and network hardware like routers,
    switches, and base stations are based on them too. In the consumer market, typical
    products with embedded systems include smart washing machines, intelligent heating
    systems, and gaming consoles. Even the plastic cards we use for banking and building
    access control can be considered a type of embedded system.

    face constraints, like the need to keep down manufacturing costs or run on hardware
    with low to moderate computational power, in addition to the rather limited options
    for input and output capabilities. Embedded systems are used in very specific,
    sometimes critical areas, and they usually operate with few user interactions,
    if any. Further, these devices are built from a wide range of hardware, firmware,
    and operating systems in use across different products, manufacturers, and industries.

    make the life of an embedded systems engineer easier. The development of security
    measures for these devices, their specific application environments, and their
    constrained resources lead to challenging tasks for architects and developers.
    As if all these things weren’t enough, in many cases, embedded systems also face
    physical attackers, which are a more powerful attack model in comparison to remote
    access on cloud or web services, for example.

- en: If we look at different application domains and industries, the state of security
    measures in embedded systems varies greatly. For example, smart card solutions
    for pay-TV were confronted with fraud cases as early as the 1990s. If people could
    circumvent the scrambling and shuffling algorithms, they were able to watch pay-TV
    for free. In addition, if attackers succeeded in cloning those smart cards, they
    could sell them at a lower price, leading to a loss in revenue for the original
    provider. Since the business model was under pressure, the security awareness
    of these companies was relatively high, and corresponding investments and developments
    in smart card security were prioritized.

    gaming consoles. The natural interest of console manufacturers is that only original
    game media can be played on their devices. If attackers succeed in running cloned
    discs, the business model suffers. After the reverse engineering community gained
    interest in analyzing game consoles, which, for example, led to the renowned book
    *Hacking the Xbox* by Andrew Huang (No Starch Press, 2003), the industry responded
    with increased security mechanisms. As a result, they reached a solid state of
    embedded system security that requires attackers to invest in a lot of resources,
    expertise, and sophisticated tools to successfully bypass protection measures.'

    have such mature security features. In 2016, this became quite obvious with the
    discovery of the *Mirai* malware that exploited hundreds of thousands of internet
    of things (IoT) devices, mainly IP cameras and home routers, turning them into
    botnets that performed enormous distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against
    websites. Further, the compilations of vulnerabilities dubbed *Ripple20* and *Amnesia:33*
    showed various weaknesses in TCP/IP stacks for embedded systems in 2020\. According
    to estimates, more than 15 million devices were affected, from medical to building
    automation to industrial control systems (ICS).

    where robustness and reliability are crucial, also have long security to-do lists.
    Although the *Stuxnet* incident reports in 2010 were a wake-up call for industrial
    automation manufacturers, more than 10 years later, the market still has a significant
    lack of well-protected devices. In 2022, a collection of vulnerabilities in operational
    technology (OT) components was published under the name of *OT:ICEFALL*. The authors
    characterized the security engineering failings as *insecurity by design* because
    the analyzed products missed even the most basic security controls.

    only marginal security awareness would probably exist. However, since we’ve seen
    many of these issues during the last 20 years while at the same time online connectivity,
    digital services, and data analytics grew increasingly relevant to companies,
    cybersecurity “suddenly” has become a requirement—for example, in the procurement
    process.

    knowledge, but they increasingly demand risk analyses, protection measures, or
    a (random) collection of standards to be fulfilled by product manufacturers. From
    my experiences in the industrial context, this sometimes initiates communication
    between customers and manufacturers to find a compromise between the practical
    need for security and the associated costs, which can be a reasonable and fruitful
    discussion for both parties.

    laws and signing international agreements pushing for basic security requirements
    that every product on the market should fulfill. In Europe, the Cybersecurity
    Act (CSA) of 2019 aims to establish a security certification framework for all
    products and services sold in the European Union, and the Cyber Resilience Act
    (CRA) of 2024 regulates cybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements.
    The European Standard ETSI EN 303 645 already defines baseline security requirements,
    especially for consumer IoT products. On the other side of the Atlantic Ocean,
    Biden’s Executive Order 14028 from May 2021 takes a similar line and aims to improve
    cybersecurity in IoT devices and software solutions. The National Institute of
    Standards and Technology (NIST) already provides recommendations for cybersecurity
    labeling of these products.

    standards in their fields. A prominent example is International Electrotechnical
    Commission (IEC) standard 62443, targeting ICS security and the industrial IoT
    (IIoT). It combines security requirements for operators, system integrators, and
    component manufacturers, which allows for a unified and interrelated security
    view of industrial systems. Regarding secure device engineering, Parts 4-1 and
    4-2 of IEC 62443 are the most relevant: Part 4-1 covers practices for a secure
    development process, and Part 4-2 is concerned with technical product security
    requirements.'

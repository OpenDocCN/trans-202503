		<p class="dedicationa"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_v"/>This book is dedicated to my loving wife, Shea Graham, who supported me throughout this process. I want the world to know how much I love you. Thanks for reading all the rough drafts. This book would not have been possible without your encouragement and support. May our future children be inspired to share their ideas with the universe and grow into a prosperous generation of Christians.</p>
		<p class="dedication">And to my family: my father, Errol Graham, son of a carpenter and the first in our family to go to college; my mother, Angelique Graham, who loves us unconditionally and always supported us; my sister, Dr. Dominique Vaughn, who is my friend for life; and my brother-in-law Adrian Vaughn, my father-in-law Les Tinsley, and my mother-in-law Fay Tinsley.</p>

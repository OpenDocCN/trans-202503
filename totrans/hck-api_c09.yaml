    of the top API vulnerabilities discussed in Chapter 3. The secret to successfully
    discovering most API vulnerabilities is knowing where to fuzz and what to fuzz
    with. In fact, you’ll likely discover many API vulnerabilities by fuzzing input
    sent to API endpoints.

    with various types of input to an endpoint in order to provoke an unintended result.
    While “various types of input” and “unintended result” might sound vague, that’s
    only because there are so many possibilities. Your input could include symbols,
    numbers, emojis, decimals, hexadecimal, system commands, SQL input, and NoSQL
    input, for instance. If the API has not implemented validation checks to handle
    harmful input, you could end up with a verbose error, a unique response, or (in
    the worst case) some sort of internal server error indicating that your fuzz caused
    a denial of service, killing the app.

    you are fuzzing with. The trick is to look for API inputs that are leveraged for
    a consumer to interact with the application and send input that is likely to result
    in errors. If these inputs do not have sufficient input handling and error handling,
    they can often lead to exploitation. Examples of this sort of API input include
    the fields involved in requests used for authentication forms, account registration,

    One way to do this is to understand what ordinary responses look like. You can
    establish this baseline by sending a set of expected requests or, as you’ll see
    later in the lab, by sending requests that you expect to fail. Then you can review
    the results to see if a majority of them are identical. For example, if you issue
    100 API requests and 98 of those result in an HTTP 200 response code with a similar
    response size, you can consider those requests to be your baseline. Also examine
    a few of the baseline responses to get a sense of their content. Once you know
    that the baseline responses have been properly handled, review the two anomalous
    responses. Figure out what input caused the difference, paying particular attention

    Comparer to get a side-by-side comparison of the differences within the responses.
    Right-click the result you’re interested in and choose **Send to Comparer (Response)**.

    act of thoroughly testing an individual request with a variety of inputs, replacing
    headers, parameters, query strings, endpoint paths, and the body of the request

    APIs. When you’re hacking, you’ll quickly discover that APIs can greatly vary
    in size. Certain APIs could have only a few endpoints and a handful of unique
    requests, so you may be able to easily test them by sending a few requests. An
    API can have many endpoints and unique requests, however. Alternatively, a single
    request could be filled with many headers and parameters.
  prefs: []

    used to test for issues across all unique requests. Typically, you can fuzz wide
    to test for improper assets management (more on this later in this chapter), finding
    all valid request methods, token-handling issues, and other information disclosure
    vulnerabilities. Fuzzing deep is best used for testing many aspects of individual
    requests. Most other vulnerability discovery will be done by fuzzing deep. In

    the tool’s Collection Runner makes it easy to run tests against all API requests.
    If an API includes 150 unique requests across all the endpoints, you can set a
    variable to a fuzzing payload entry and test it across all 150 requests. This
    is particularly easy to do when you’ve built a collection or imported API requests
    into Postman. For example, you might use this strategy to test whether any of
    the requests fail to handle various “bad” characters. Send a single payload across
    the API and check for anomalies.

- en: Improper assets management vulnerabilities arise when an organization exposes
    APIs that are either retired, in a test environment, or still in development.
    In any of these cases, there is a good chance the API has fewer protections than
    its supported production counterparts. Improper assets management might affect
    only a single endpoint or request, so it’s often useful to fuzz wide to test if
    improper assets management exists for any request across an API.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As discussed in Chapter 3, you can find improper assets management vulnerabilities
    by paying close attention to outdated API documentation. If an organization’s
    API documentation has not been updated along with the organization’s API endpoints,
    it could contain references to portions of the API that are no longer supported.
    Also, check any sort of changelog or GitHub repository. A changelog that says
    something along the lines of “resolved broken object level authorization vulnerability
    in v3” will make finding an endpoint still using v1 or v2 all the sweeter.

    you can see that the `baseURL` variable used within all requests for this collection

    indicate that the API is vulnerable. Make sure to insert this test at the collection
    level so that it will be run on every request when you use the Collection Runner.

    step will be to test the non-production endpoint for additional weaknesses. This
    is where your information-gathering skills will be put to good use. On the target’s
    GitHub or in a changelog, you might discover that the older version of the API
    was vulnerable to a BOLA attack, so you could attempt such an attack on the vulnerable
    endpoint. If you don’t find any leads during reconnaissance, combine the other
    techniques found in this book to leverage the vulnerability.

    For example, for an email field in a PUT request, an API provider may do a pretty
    decent job at requiring that the contents of the request body match the format
    of an email address. In other words, anything sent as a value that isn’t an email
    address might result in the same 400 Bad Request error. Similar restrictions likely
    apply to integer and Boolean values. If you’ve thoroughly tested a field and it

    tests or save it for more thorough testing in a separate attack.

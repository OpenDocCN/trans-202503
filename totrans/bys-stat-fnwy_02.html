<div class="image1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/common.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In this first chapter, I’ll give you an overview of <em>Bayesian reasoning</em>, the formal process we use to update our beliefs about the world once we’ve observed some data. We’ll work through a scenario and explore how we can map our everyday experience to Bayesian reasoning.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The good news is that you were already a Bayesian even before you picked up this book! Bayesian statistics is closely aligned with how people naturally use evidence to create new beliefs and reason about everyday problems; the tricky part is breaking down this natural thought process into a rigorous, mathematical one.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In statistics, we use particular calculations and models to more accurately quantify probability. For now, though, we won’t use any math or models; we’ll just get you familiar with the basic concepts and use our intuition to determine probabilities. Then, in the next chapter, we’ll put exact numbers to probabilities. Throughout the rest of the book, you’ll learn how we can use rigorous mathematical techniques to formally model and reason about the concepts we’ll cover in this chapter.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_4"/><strong>Reasoning About Strange Experiences</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="bq">One night you are suddenly awakened by a bright light at your window. You jump up from bed and look out to see a large object in the sky that can only be described as saucer shaped. You are generally a skeptic and have never believed in alien encounters, but, completely perplexed by the scene outside, you find yourself thinking, <em>Could this be a UFO?!</em></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Bayesian reasoning involves stepping through your thought process when you’re confronted with a situation to recognize when you’re making probabilistic assumptions, and then using those assumptions to update your beliefs about the world. In the UFO scenario, you’ve already gone through a full Bayesian analysis because you:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Observed data</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Formed a hypothesis</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Updated your beliefs based on the data</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p class="indent">This reasoning tends to happen so quickly that you don’t have any time to analyze your own thinking. You created a new belief without questioning it: whereas before you did not believe in the existence of UFOs, after the event you’ve updated your beliefs and now think you’ve seen a UFO.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In this chapter, you’ll focus on structuring your beliefs and the process of creating them so you can examine it more formally, and we’ll look at quantifying this process in chapters to come.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s look at each step of reasoning in turn, starting with observing data.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec1"><strong><em>Observing Data</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Founding your beliefs on data is a key component of Bayesian reasoning. Before you can draw any conclusions about the scene (such as claiming what you see is a UFO), you need to understand the data you’re observing, in this case:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li class="noindent">An extremely bright light outside your window</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">A saucer-shaped object hovering in the air</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="indent">Based on your past experience, you would describe what you saw out your window as “surprising.” In probabilistic terms, we could write this as:</p>&#13;
<p class="equ"><em>P</em>(bright light outside window, saucer-shaped object in sky) = very low</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">where <em>P</em> denotes <em>probability</em> and the two pieces of data are listed inside the parentheses. You would read this equation as: “The probability of observing bright lights outside the window and a saucer-shaped object in the sky is very low.” In probability theory, we use a comma to separate events when we’re looking at the combined probability of multiple events. Note that this data does not contain anything specific about UFOs; it’s simply made up of your observations—this will be important later.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_5"/>We can also examine probabilities of single events, which would be written as:</p>&#13;
<p class="equ"><em>P</em>(rain) = likely</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This equation is read as: “The probability of rain is likely.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For our UFO scenario, we’re determining the probability of <em>both</em> events occurring <em>together</em>. The probability of one of these two events occurring on its own would be entirely different. For example, the bright lights alone could easily be a passing car, so on its own the probability of this event is more likely than its probability coupled with seeing a saucer-shaped object (and the saucer-shaped object would still be surprising even on its own).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">So how are we determining this probability? Right now we’re using our intuition—that is, our general sense of the likelihood of perceiving these events. In the next chapter, we’ll see how we can come up with exact numbers for our probabilities.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec2"><strong><em>Holding Prior Beliefs and Conditioning Probabilities</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You are able to wake up in the morning, make your coffee, and drive to work without doing a lot of analysis because you hold <em>prior beliefs</em> about how the world works. Our prior beliefs are collections of beliefs we’ve built up over a lifetime of experiences (that is, of observing data). You believe that the sun will rise because the sun has risen every day since you were born. Likewise, you might have a prior belief that when the light is red for oncoming traffic at an intersection, and your light is green, it’s safe to drive through the intersection. Without prior beliefs, we would go to bed terrified each night that the sun might not rise tomorrow, and stop at every intersection to carefully inspect oncoming traffic.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Our prior beliefs say that seeing bright lights outside the window at the same time as seeing a saucer-shaped object is a rare occurrence on Earth. However, if you lived on a distant planet populated by vast numbers of flying saucers, with frequent interstellar visitors, the probability of seeing lights and saucer-shaped objects in the sky would be much higher.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In a formula we enter prior beliefs after our data, separated with a | like so:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0005-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">We would read this equation as: “The probability of observing bright lights and a saucer-shaped object in the sky, <em>given</em> our experience on Earth, is very low.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The probability outcome is called a <em>conditional probability</em> because we are <em>conditioning</em> the probability of one event occurring on the existence of something else. In this case, we’re conditioning the probability of our observation on our prior experience.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_6"/>In the same way we used <em>P</em> for probability, we typically use shorter variable names for events and conditions. If you’re unfamiliar with reading equations, they can seem too terse at first. After a while, though, you’ll find that shorter variable names aid readability and help you to see how equations generalize to larger classes of problems. We’ll assign all of our data to a single variable, <em>D</em>:</p>&#13;
<p class="equ"><em>D</em> = bright light outside window, saucer-shaped object in sky</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">So from now on when we refer to the probability of set of data, we’ll simply say, <em>P</em>(<em>D</em>).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Likewise, we use the variable <em>X</em> to represent our prior belief, like so:</p>&#13;
<p class="equ"><em>X</em> = experience on Earth</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We can now write this equation as <em>P</em>(<em>D</em> | <em>X</em>). This is much easier to write and doesn’t change the meaning.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch01lev3sec1"><strong>Conditioning on Multiple Beliefs</strong></h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">We can add more than one piece of prior knowledge, too, if more than one variable is going to significantly affect the probability. Suppose that it’s July 4th and you live in the United States. From prior experience you know that fireworks are common on the Fourth of July. Given your experience on Earth <em>and</em> the fact that it’s July 4th, the probability of seeing lights in the sky is less unlikely, and even the saucer-shaped object could be related to some fireworks display. You could rewrite this equation as:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0006-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Taking both these experiences into account, our conditional probability changed from “very low” to “low.”</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch01lev3sec2"><strong>Assuming Prior Beliefs in Practice</strong></h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In statistics, we don’t usually explicitly include a condition for all of our existing experiences, because it can be assumed. For that reason, in this book we won’t include a separate variable for this condition. However, in Bayesian analysis, it’s essential to keep in mind that our understanding of the world is always conditioned on our prior experience in the world. For the rest of this chapter, we’ll keep the “experience on Earth” variable around to remind us of this.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec3"><strong><em>Forming a Hypothesis</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">So far we have our data, <em>D</em> (that we have seen a bright light and a saucer-shaped object), and our prior experience, <em>X</em>. In order to explain what you <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_7"/>saw, you need to form some kind of <em>hypothesis</em>—a model about how the world works that makes a prediction. Hypotheses can come in many forms. All of our basic beliefs about the world are hypotheses:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li class="noindent">If you believe the Earth rotates, you predict the sun will rise and set at certain times.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">If you believe that your favorite baseball team is the best, you predict they will win more than the other teams.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">If you believe in astrology, you predict that the alignment of the stars will describe people and events.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="indent">Hypotheses can also be more formal or sophisticated:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li class="noindent">A scientist may hypothesize that a certain treatment will slow the growth of cancer.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">A quantitative analyst in finance may have a model of how the market will behave.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">A deep neural network may predict which images are animals and which ones are plants.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="indent">All of these examples are hypotheses because they have some way of understanding the world and use that understanding to make a prediction about how the world will behave. When we think of hypotheses in Bayesian statistics, we are usually concerned with how well they predict the data we observe.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you see the evidence and think <em>A UFO!</em>, you are forming a hypothesis. The UFO hypothesis is likely based on countless movies and television shows you’ve seen in your prior experience. We would define our first hypothesis as:</p>&#13;
<p class="equ"><em>H</em><sub>1</sub> = A UFO is in my back yard!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">But what is this hypothesis predicting? If we think of this situation backward, we might ask, “If there was a UFO in your back yard, what would you expect to see?” And you might answer, “Bright lights and a saucer-shaped object.” Because <em>H</em><sub>1</sub> predicts the data <em>D</em>, when we observe our data given our hypothesis, the probability of the data increases. Formally we write this as:</p>&#13;
<p class="equ"><em>P</em>(<em>D</em>| <em>H</em><sub>1</sub>,<em>X</em>) &gt;&gt; <em>P</em>(<em>D</em>| <em>X</em>)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This equation says: “The probability of seeing bright lights and a saucer-shaped object in the sky, given my belief that this is a UFO and my prior experience, is much higher [indicated by the double greater-than sign <em>&gt;&gt;</em>] than just seeing bright lights and a saucer-shaped object in the sky without explanation.” Here we’ve used the language of probability to demonstrate that our hypothesis explains the data.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_8"/><strong><em>Spotting Hypotheses in Everyday Speech</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">It’s easy to see a relationship between our everyday language and probability. Saying something is “surprising,” for example, might be the same as saying it has low-probability data based on our prior experiences. Saying something “makes sense” might indicate we have high-probability data based on our prior experiences. This may seem obvious once pointed out, but the key to probabilistic reasoning is to think carefully about how you interpret data, create hypotheses, and change your beliefs, even in an ordinary, everyday scenario. Without <em>H</em><sub>1</sub>, you’d be in a state of confusion because you have no explanation for the data you observed.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec2"><strong>Gathering More Evidence and Updating Your Beliefs</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Now you have your data and a hypothesis. However, given your prior experience as a skeptic, that hypothesis still seems pretty outlandish. In order to improve your state of knowledge and draw more reliable conclusions, you need to collect more data. This is the next step in statistical reasoning, as well as in your own intuitive thinking.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To collect more data, we need to make more observations. In our scenario, you look out your window to see what you can observe:</p>&#13;
<p class="bq">As you look toward the bright light outside, you notice more lights in the area. You also see that the large saucer-shaped object is held up by wires, and notice a camera crew. You hear a loud clap and someone call out “Cut!”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You have, very likely, instantly changed your mind about what you think is happening in this scene. Your inference before was that you might be witnessing a UFO. Now, with this new evidence, you realize it looks more like someone is shooting a movie nearby.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">With this thought process, your brain has once again performed some sophisticated Bayesian analysis in an instant! Let’s break down what happened in your head in order to reason about events more carefully.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You started with your initial hypothesis:</p>&#13;
<p class="equ"><em>H</em><sub>1</sub> = A UFO has landed!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In isolation, this hypothesis, given your experience, is extremely unlikely:</p>&#13;
<p class="equ"><em>P</em>(<em>H</em><sub>1</sub> | <em>X</em>) = very, very low</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">However, it was the only useful explanation you could come up with given the data you had available. When you observed additional data, you immediately realized that there’s another possible hypothesis—that a movie is being filmed nearby:</p>&#13;
<p class="equ"><em>H</em><sub>2</sub> = A film is being made outside your window</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_9"/>In isolation, the probability of this hypothesis is also intuitively very low (unless you happen to live near a movie studio):</p>&#13;
<p class="equ"><em>P</em>(<em>H</em><sub>2</sub> | <em>X</em>) = very low</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notice that we set the probability of <em>H</em><sub>1</sub> as “very, very low” and the probability of <em>H</em><sub>2</sub> as just “very low.” This corresponds to your intuition: if someone came up to you, without any data, and asked, “Which do you think is more likely, a UFO appearing at night in your neighborhood or a movie being filmed next door?” you would say the movie scenario is more likely than a UFO appearance.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now we just need a way to take our new data into account when changing our beliefs.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec3"><strong>Comparing Hypotheses</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You first accepted the UFO hypothesis, despite it being unlikely, because you didn’t initially have any other explanation. Now, however, there’s another possible explanation—a movie being filmed—so you have formed an <em>alternate hypothesis</em>. Considering alternate hypotheses is the process of comparing multiple theories using the data you have.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you see the wires, film crew, and additional lights, your data changes. Your updated data are:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0009-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">On observing this extra data, you change your conclusion about what was happening. Let’s break this process down into Bayesian reasoning. Your first hypothesis, <em>H</em><sub>1</sub>, gave you a way to explain your data and end your confusion, but with your additional observations <em>H</em><sub>1</sub> no longer explains the data well. We can write this as:</p>&#13;
<p class="equ"><em>P</em>(<em>D</em><sub>updated</sub> | <em>H</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>X</em>) = very, very low</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You now have a new hypothesis, <em>H</em><sub>2</sub>, which explains the data much better, written as follows:</p>&#13;
<p class="equ"><em>P</em>(<em>D</em><sub>updated</sub> | <em>H</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>X</em>) &gt;&gt; <em>P</em>(<em>D</em><sub>updated</sub> | <em>H</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>X</em>)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The key here is to understand that we’re comparing how well each of these hypotheses explains the observed data. When we say, “The probability of the data, given the second hypothesis, is much greater than the first,” we’re saying that what we observed is better explained by the second hypothesis. This brings us to the true heart of Bayesian analysis: <em>the test of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_10"/>your beliefs is how well they explain the world</em>. We say that one belief is more accurate than another because it provides a better explanation of the world we observe.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Mathematically, we express this idea as the ratio of the two probabilities:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0010-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">When this ratio is a large number, say 1,000, it means “<em>H</em><sub>2</sub> explains the data 1,000 times better than <em>H</em><sub>1</sub>.” Because <em>H</em><sub>2</sub> explains the data many times better than another <em>H</em><sub>1</sub>, we update our beliefs from <em>H</em><sub>1</sub> to <em>H</em><sub>2</sub>. This is exactly what happened when you changed your mind about the likely explanation for what you observed. You now believe that what you’ve seen is a movie being made outside your window, because this is a more likely explanation of all the data you observed.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec4"><strong>Data Informs Belief; Belief Should Not Inform Data</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">One final point worth stressing is that the only absolute in all these examples is your data. Your hypotheses change, and your experience in the world, <em>X</em>, may be different from someone else’s, but the data, <em>D</em>, is shared by all.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Consider the following two formulas. The first is one we’ve used throughout this chapter:</p>&#13;
<p class="equ"><em>P</em>(<em>D</em> | <em>H</em>,<em>X</em>)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">which we read as “The probability of the data given my hypotheses and experience in the world,” or more plainly, “How well my beliefs explain what I observe.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">But there is a reversal of this, common in everyday thinking, which is:</p>&#13;
<p class="equ"><em>P</em>(<em>H</em> | <em>D</em>,<em>X</em>)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We read this as “The probability of <em>my beliefs</em> given the data and my experiences in the world,” or “How well what I observe supports what I believe.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the first case, we change our beliefs according to data we gather and observations we make about the world that describe it better. In the second case, we gather data to support our existing beliefs. Bayesian thinking is about changing your mind and updating how you understand the world. The data we observe is all that is real, so our beliefs ultimately need to shift until they align with the data.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_11"/>In life, too, your beliefs should always be mutable.</p>&#13;
<p class="bq">As the film crew packs up, you notice that all the vans bear military insignia. The crew takes off their coats to reveal army fatigues and you overhear someone say, “Well, that should have fooled anyone who saw that . . . good thinking.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">With this new evidence, your beliefs may shift again!</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec5"><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Let’s recap what you’ve learned. Your beliefs start with your existing experience of the world, <em>X</em>. When you observe data, <em>D</em>, it either aligns with your experience, <em>P</em>(<em>D</em> | <em>X</em>) = very high, or it surprises you, <em>P</em>(<em>D</em> | <em>X</em>) = very low. To understand the world, you rely on beliefs you have about what you observe, or hypotheses, <em>H</em>. Oftentimes a new hypothesis can help you explain the data that surprises you, <em>P</em>(<em>D</em> | <em>H</em>, <em>X</em>) &gt;&gt; <em>P</em>(<em>D</em> | <em>X</em>). When you gather new data or come up with new ideas, you can create more hypotheses, <em>H</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>H</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>H</em><sub>3</sub>, . . . You update your beliefs when a new hypothesis explains your data much better than your old hypothesis:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0011-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Finally, you should be far more concerned with data changing your beliefs than with ensuring data supports your beliefs, <em>P</em>(<em>H</em> | <em>D</em>).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">With these foundations set up, you’re ready to start adding numbers into the mix. In the rest of <a href="part01.xhtml#part01">Part I</a>, you’ll model your beliefs mathematically to precisely determine how and when you should change them.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec6"><strong>Exercises</strong></h3>&#13;

    much more than that, but photo processing is, indeed, one of its most valuable
    uses. This is why the first manipulations we demonstrated in [1.3 Working with
    Images](ch01s03.html "1.3 Working with Images") dealt mainly with photographs
    and why we devote two chapters to the subject—this one and [Chapter 5](ch05.html
    "Chapter 5. Composite Photography"). The main difference between these two chapters
    is that in this chapter we process only one photograph at a time, whereas in [Chapter 5](ch05.html
    "Chapter 5. Composite Photography") we’ll process several simultaneously to create
    composite images.

    initial photograph") needs to be cropped and straightened. We then need to restore
    the perspective. This image could also use some lighting correction to enhance
    visibility inside the church. First, however, we’ll straighten out the picture.
    To do this, we determine the rotation angle and then use the Rotate tool to level
    the image.

    In its options dialog, check the USE INFO WINDOW box. A good place to measure
    the angle is along the window frame. Zoom into the image and position it in the
    Image window so the top of the frame occupies the width of the Image window. To
    zoom, click the menu at the bottom of the Image window and select 100%. To reposition
    the image, use the crossed arrows in the bottom-right corner of the Image window.
    You can also reposition an image by holding down the ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1453920.png.jpg)
    key and moving the mouse or by using the scroll wheel on your mouse. The scroll
    wheel moves the image vertically, by default, or horizontally if you press ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1453922.png.jpg).
    Pressing ![](httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1453844.png.jpg) while using
    the scroll wheel allows you to zoom in or out.

    large to fit on the monitor. Recall that a 1024 × 768 image, which fills a small
    screen, will be only 3.4 inches (8.7 cm) wide when printed. This is because screen
    resolution is 72 or 96 pixels per inch (ppi), whereas in print the standard is
    300 ppi. Thus if you want to print your photograph with a 6-inch (15-centimeter)
    width, your image file must be at least 1800 pixels wide. Note that on an inkjet

    format. When a smaller file is needed (i.e., for a website), resize a copy of
    the image to 1024 × 768 or even 800 × 600 and export it as a JPEG. To print a
    photograph at 300 ppi, compute its new width by multiplying the desired width
    (in inches) by 300 (or by 118 if the desired width is in centimeters). For example,
    a 10 × 15 cm print should be 1180 × 1770 pixels. Don’t worry too much about the
    math, however. The software that controls your printer should be able to resize
    the print to whatever dimensions you want. Generally, you should adjust the dimensions
    of an image when printing it via the printing software. This leaves the image
    file unaltered, preventing the loss of quality that’s inherent in resizing.

    tool. The only difference is that the pixels need not be contiguous; this is an
    advantage if you want to select an area consisting of many small, separate parts
    that are all approximately the same color. Sometimes, however, unwanted pixels
    are included in a selection simply because they are similar enough to the target
    color. Thus, each tool is useful in different circumstances.

    the outline of the target area to make a selection. If the target area is delimited
    by strong contrasts with the background, then Scissors Select automatically follows
    the outline, however complicated it may be. [Figure 2-49](ch02s03.html#selecting_with_the_scissors_select_tool

    final selection") shows the resulting selection, obtained after closing the path
    and clicking in the center of the selection. In the example selection, we cut
    off the feet and include the area between the legs of the statue, but we could
    easily fix that by continuing the initial selection to the base of the statue
    and then removing the area between the legs using Subtract mode.

    by the difference that photo retouching can make. These days hiding blemishes,
    removing wrinkles, and even changing the color of a person’s eyes is very easy.
    Let’s experiment with a portrait of a very unimportant person, one of the authors
    of this book. [Figure 2-109](ch02s05.html#initial_photograph-id00032 "Figure 2-109. The

    the proper exposure for scenes with strong contrast can be difficult, even impossible.
    Taking multiple shots of a high-contrast scene at different exposures is one way
    to handle the challenge. Many digital cameras even offer a mode called “auto exposure
    bracketing,” wherein the camera takes three shots at various exposures in quick
    succession around the optimal, automatic exposure.

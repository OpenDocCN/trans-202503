    to have him purchase something with it. That’s how we got hooked ourselves. In
    this chapter, we’ll help you perform your first Bitcoin transaction, without worrying
    about too much technical stuff. Along the way, though, we’ll discuss how Bitcoin
    works. After reading this chapter, you’ll understand the basics of Bitcoin—enough
    to chat about it at any cocktail party.

    money, and as mentioned in [Chapter 1](../Text/ch01.html#ch01), no central authority
    (e.g., bank or government) is involved. To best understand how the system works,
    let’s walk through an example using dollars first.

    list of all the people who possess that money. Everyone, including you (even though
    you have only $5), has a copy of this list. When you give $2 to your friend, you
    must subtract $2 from your entry on the list and add $2 to her entry. After informing
    her of the transaction, she updates her list as well. In fact, everyone in the
    world needs to update the list; otherwise, the list would be inaccurate. Therefore,
    not only do you need to notify your friend, but you also need to publicly announce
    that you are updating the list. If you tried to cheat the system and send your
    friend $1000, your cheating attempt would be easy to catch because everyone knows
    you have only $5 to give.

    to the entire currency system, whereas bitcoins are the units of the currency.
    Although the total currency supply is capped at 21 million bitcoins, each one
    can be subdivided into smaller denominations; for example, 0.1 bitcoins and 0.001
    bitcoins. The smallest unit, a hundred millionth of a bitcoin (0.00000001 bitcoins),
    is called a *satoshi* in honor of Satoshi Nakamoto. As a result, goods can be
    priced in Bitcoin very precisely, and people can easily pay for those goods in
    exact change (e.g., a merchant can price a gallon of milk at 0.00152374 bitcoins,
    or 152,374 satoshis).

    BTC. Despite the fact that the BTC abbreviation has been widely used since the
    beginning of Bitcoin’s development, more recently some merchants and websites
    have started using XBT because it conforms better to certain international naming
    standards.^([1](../Text/footnote.html#footnote5)) As bitcoins have appreciated
    in value, it has become increasingly common to work with thousandths or even millionths
    of bitcoins, which are called *millibitcoins (mBTC)* and *microbitcoins (μBTC)*,
    respectively. Many people have suggested simpler names for Bitcoin’s smaller denominations,

    pseudonym for a person (or group of people, business, etc.), and the use of pseudonyms
    is why people can use bitcoins without revealing personal information. The following

    and numbers (usually beginning with the number 1). To send bitcoins to others
    (e.g., an online merchant, a friend, or a family member), you only need to know
    their Bitcoin address. In turn, when you share your address with others, they
    can send you bitcoins. Because Bitcoin addresses are cumbersome to type, many
    people use *quick response (QR) codes* to represent their address (see [Figure
    2-1](../Text/ch02.html#ch02fig1)).^([2](../Text/footnote.html#footnote6)) For
    convenience, you can put your Bitcoin address, either typed or as a QR code (or
    both), on your business card, personal website, or storefront (if you’re a merchant).
    Although you need an Internet connection to *send* bitcoins, you don’t need to
    be connected to *receive* them. For example, if you work for a charity and pass
    out thousands of business cards containing your Bitcoin address and a statement
    like “Please consider donating in bitcoins,” your organization can collect bitcoins
    while you sleep.

    means that the bank would update its privately held ledger that listed every account
    at that bank. If a fire or other disaster destroyed that ledger, information about
    who owned the assets at the bank might be lost forever. Although Bitcoin also
    uses a ledger, identical copies of it are distributed across millions of computers
    around the world. Consequently, no central point of failure exists, and transactions
    recorded on the Bitcoin ledger are permanent and impossible to erase. Moving bitcoins
    from one address to another is equivalent to sending an instruction to all of
    the computers on the Bitcoin network to update each ledger in the same way.

    balance at that address will be known to everyone (including all incoming and

    transaction is authorized before making any updates to the public ledger. Specifically,
    they check whether the transaction has been *digitally signed* using a private
    key. A digital signature is extra data appended to a transaction that can only
    be created by someone possessing the corresponding private key. Similar to a PIN,
    a private key should be kept secret. If someone obtains your private key, he will

    different from making an online payment with a credit card. When you use a credit
    card, you provide your credit card number to someone to authorize a transaction.

    forever. Clearly, it is extremely important not to lose your private key! Fortunately,
    you can easily make digital backups of your private keys or write them on a piece
    of paper and keep them in a safe place. Losing your Bitcoin address is not a problem,

    that the two addresses are linked, such as making a single purchase using bitcoins

    Bitcoin wallets is not always used consistently. Often, Bitcoin wallet programs
    are called *Bitcoin wallets* for short, confusing these two distinct concepts.
    When you save a Bitcoin wallet (perhaps to make a backup copy), you create a *wallet

    2-4](../Text/ch02.html#ch02fig4)). Electrum uses this seed to create your Bitcoin
    addresses and private keys; therefore, the seed must be kept secret, similar to
    your private keys. Because we’ll be dealing with only small amounts of bitcoins
    in this chapter, you don’t need to be too careful just yet. However, you should
    start keeping these security details in mind. A major benefit of a seed is that
    if you lose your computer (say, in a fire or theft), everything—your wallet, your
    Bitcoin address, your private keys, and (most importantly) your money—can be recovered

    your Bitcoin wallet on your computer in an encrypted form, the wallet is useless
    without the password. With many other Bitcoin wallet programs if you forget your

    details of what they do later in the chapter. For now, keep in mind that anyone
    can be a miner (including you) by running open source Bitcoin-mining software
    on a computer that is connected to the Bitcoin network. At any given moment, tens
    of thousands of miners are connected to the Bitcoin network. All volunteer their
    computers for the purpose of adding new transactions to the blockchain (we’ll
    explain why they do this in a moment).

    Then everyone else on the Bitcoin network follows suit and updates their own copy
    of the blockchain (this includes other miners and Bitcoin wallet programs). Why
    does only one miner add a block, and how is it decided which of the thousands
    of miners it is? This is where Bitcoin gets interesting—and a little technical.

    if you wanted to complete transactions, your Bitcoin wallet program would need
    the latest copy of the blockchain. However, you might not want to send or receive
    bitcoins for months, so why bother updating your copy of the blockchain in the
    meantime? For the Bitcoin system to work, many people need to keep up-to-date
    copies of the blockchain. The reason is that if only one person had the latest
    copy, she could manipulate the number of bitcoins people had on record. Therefore,
    good will alone isn’t sufficient to keep the system running. But the lure of a
    reward is always an attraction.

    imagine Crowley wants to buy a $10,000 car from Clarice. (You’ll learn more about
    our friend Crowley the Crocodile in the comic in [Chapter 5](../Text/ch05.html#ch05).)
    Using traditional currency, two people engaging in this transaction would probably
    go to a bank and have the money transferred between their bank accounts (or use
    a cashier’s check, which is analogous to this; see [Figure 2-10](../Text/ch02.html#ch02fig10)).

    Clarice can trust; that is, to affirm that the ledger has been updated correctly.

    adjusting the blockchain by adding a block to it. It turns out anyone can fill
    this role, as long as he is not connected with either party in the transaction,
    because that could lead to a conflict of interest. Picking a person randomly through
    a lottery helps accomplish this. So with Bitcoin, a lottery picks a random miner,
    who then announces to the network that certain Bitcoin transactions are valid
    (see [Figure 2-11](../Text/ch02.html#ch02fig11)).

    transactions of the previous lottery winner (see [Figure 2-12](../Text/ch02.html#ch02fig12)).'

    which is a certain amount of bitcoins. The reward includes all of the transaction
    fees for the transactions in that block, which motivates miners to collect as
    many transactions into a block as possible, increasing their reward. To be eligible
    for the reward from the next block, which is added 10 minutes later, a miner needs
    to have the latest copy of the block-chain to participate in the next round. This
    process is done automatically by open source Bitcoin-mining software that runs
    on computers controlled by the people involved in mining. Because of this incentive
    structure, thousands of miners constantly help process the transactions of Bitcoin
    users, making sure that the blockchain is always up-to-date.

    until they find a winning one. This takes about ten minutes. The community then
    verifies (also through cryptography) that the number found by the individual miner
    is the winner, and the miner adds a new block to the blockchain and collects the
    reward. When this happens, the phrase commonly used is that a miner has *found
    a block*.

- en: A *transaction confirmation* is a common concept in Bitcoin. Some online merchants
    that accept bitcoins may require one or more transaction confirmations before
    delivering their good or service. Every transaction exists in some block on the
    blockchain. The blocks behind it are older, and the blocks ahead of it are newer.
    The position of a block relative to the tip of the blockchain is known as the
    *block depth*. The most recently added block has a depth of 1, the block behind
    it has a depth of 2, and so on. The number of confirmations a transaction has
    is equal to the depth of its block. So a transaction that has not been added to
    the blockchain (yet) has zero confirmations; it has one confirmation when it is
    added in a new block; it has two confirmations when a block is added ahead of
    it; and so on. The concept is simple enough, but why do merchants require transaction
    confirmations?

- en: For low-value transactions, such as buying a cup of coffee, merchants normally
    forgo the transaction confirmation. You just send your bitcoins, grab your coffee,
    and go on your way. In general, Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, and merchants
    know within a few seconds after you click Send that you’ve paid for your drink
    (or whatever you’re buying). However, if a merchant sells a high-priced item,
    such as a car, it becomes critical to consider transaction confirmations.

- en: A malicious user with very significant computational resources (think of a James
    Bond–style supervillain) can try to *double spend* his bitcoins, which is essentially
    an attempt to trick the receiver into accepting bitcoins that were simultaneously
    sent to someone else as well (the “someone else” could be another Bitcoin address
    controlled by the supervillain). When miners on the Bitcoin network detect two
    transactions that spent the same bitcoins (but were sent to different addresses),
    they usually accept whichever one they received first and ignore the second. More
    important, it’s impossible for both transactions to be added to a block because
    one contradicts the other. The supervillain’s intent is for the merchant to ship
    the car but have the transaction be ignored and not added to the blockchain.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fortunately, this devious scheme is usually unsuccessful because many merchants
    use special monitoring software and can recognize when two conflicting Bitcoin
    transactions are broadcast at the same time (at which point the supervillain may
    be kicked out of the car dealership). An even simpler solution for merchants to
    prevent this kind of payment fraud is to wait 10 minutes until the transaction
    has at least one confirmation before agreeing to ship the car. However, if a supervillain
    possesses truly extraordinary resources, such as many millions of dollars of computer
    hardware, he can attempt to make the Bitcoin network orphan the newest block in
    the blockchain, resulting in a single transaction confirmation being ignored.
    To cope with this remote possibility, merchants who sell high-end goods typically
    wait until a transaction has two confirmations before handing over the keys to
    the buyer. In general, the higher the value of the item being transacted, the
    more confirmations a merchant can demand before considering the transaction to
    be settled. The cost for a malicious villain to double spend those bitcoins rises
    exponentially with each confirmation.

    adding them to the blockchain in the form of blocks. Why is it called mining?
    The term is derived from how bitcoins are initially distributed. Although the
    total supply of bitcoins is capped at 21 million, this total is reached slowly
    over time. In the beginning, the initial supply of bitcoins was zero. Bitcoin
    miners receive a reward for processing other people’s transactions; each reward
    is a small sum of *newly minted* bitcoins that increases the total supply in circulation.
    In this sense, Bitcoin mining is similar to gold mining: Earth has a fixed amount
    of gold, and miners slowly dig it out over time.'

- en: As mentioned earlier, miners must find a certain winning number by generating
    numbers at random repeatedly to win these newly minted bitcoins. Because fast
    computers can generate these random numbers more rapidly, this creates an incentive
    for miners to use increasingly powerful computers to mine bitcoins. In the very
    early stages of Bitcoin, personal computers were commonly used to generate random
    numbers, but soon people started building special-purpose computers designed solely
    for Bitcoin mining. Today, mining bitcoins requires significant capital, expertise,
    and access to inexpensive electricity. In fact, the evolution of Bitcoin mining
    resembles the way gold mining has changed over times. At one time unearthing gold
    could be done by a person panning in a riverbed, but now excavation is performed
    by large companies with expensive drills.

    transaction fees. When you send bitcoins to someone, a small amount of additional
    bitcoins is added as a transaction fee.^([7](../Text/footnote.html#footnote11))
    Transaction fees are typically a few cents and are part of the reward that miners
    receive when they win the lottery and add a new block to the blockchain. Because
    a block is a collection of hundreds or thousands of transactions, the miner’s
    reward is the sum of all the transaction fees in that new block. The second component
    of the reward is a certain number of newly minted bitcoins.'

    gradually over time. The first 210,000 blocks—which based on a 10-minute spacing
    took about 4 years to mine—provided every winning miner with 50 newly minted bitcoins
    per block in addition to the transaction fees. The next 210,000 blocks (blocks
    (210,001 through 420,000) reward miners with only 25 newly minted bitcoins per
    block. Thereafter, the reward drops to 12.5, then 6.725, and so on. Because this
    mining process is the *only* source of new bitcoins, it is the reason no more
    than 21 million bitcoins will ever be in circulation.

    halves, the transaction fees per block will continue to grow as the Bitcoin user

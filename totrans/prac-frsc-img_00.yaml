- en: Many digital forensics books are available on the market today. But the importance
    of forensic acquisition and evidence preservation tends to receive minimal attention.
    Often, the topic is only briefly covered in smaller chapters or subsections of
    a larger book. I thought that the topic of acquisition and evidence preservation
    was large enough to warrant its own book, and this book addresses this gap in
    the literature.

- en: Another motivating factor to write this book was my desire to give back to the
    community in some way. After working professionally in a digital forensics lab
    for more than a decade and regularly using open source tools for various tasks
    (in addition to other commercial tools), I wanted to provide an additional resource
    for my colleagues and other professionals.

- en: A third motivating factor was the increasing importance of preserving forensic
    evidence in the private sector. Investigating misconduct, fraud, malware, cyber
    attacks, and other abuse is becoming more common across private industry. But
    emphasis on the steps needed to acquire and preserve evidence is often lacking.
    Law enforcement agencies require properly acquired and preserved evidence to prosecute
    criminals. Civil cases involving e-discovery might require the sound acquisition
    and preservation of disk images. Large organizations with internal teams managing
    human resources disputes, policy violations, and whistle-blowing incidents can
    also benefit from following accepted procedures for collecting and preserving
    digital evidence.

    command line has been around since the teletype days of the 1960s, making it more
    than half a century old. In computing, although age is sometimes viewed as a sign
    of obsolescence, it can also be a sign of maturity and dependability, which is
    the case with the Linux/Unix command line. Even Microsoft has recognized the value
    and power of the command line by introducing and promoting PowerShell as an alternative
    to the aging DOS prompt.

  zh: 为什么一本基于命令行的书今天仍然有用或相关？计算机命令行自 1960 年代的电传打字机时代就已经存在，至今已有超过半个世纪的历史。在计算机领域，虽然年龄有时被视为过时的标志，但它也可以是成熟和可靠的标志，这正是
    Linux/Unix 命令行的特点。即使是微软也认识到命令行的价值和力量，通过引入和推广 PowerShell 作为 DOS 提示符的替代方案。

  zh: 有许多原因解释了命令行为何多年来仍然保持其流行性，并且继续与本书讨论的话题相关。以下是一些例子：
- en: • **Easier scripting and automation possibilities:** A GUI interface is designed
    for human use, whereas the command line can be used by either human or machine.
    This makes the command line particularly useful for scripting and automating work.
  id: totrans-15

  zh: • **更简便的脚本编写与自动化可能性：** 图形用户界面（GUI）是为人类使用设计的，而命令行可以由人类或机器使用。这使得命令行在脚本编写和工作自动化方面特别有用。
- en: • **Better understanding of how things work under the hood:** Graphical tools
    are often simply frontends to command line tools. Learning command line tools
    helps you understand what is going on under the hood when you’re using the GUI
    frontend tools.

  zh: • **更好地理解底层工作原理：** 图形工具通常只是命令行工具的前端。学习命令行工具有助于你理解在使用图形界面工具时底层到底发生了什么。
- en: • **Flexibility and efficiency:** When you execute certain tasks on the command
    line, you have more flexibility, power, and control. For example, piping and redirection
    allow you to combine multiple steps into a single command line.
  id: totrans-17

  zh: • **灵活性和高效性：** 当你在命令行上执行某些任务时，你拥有更多的灵活性、控制力和力量。例如，管道和重定向使你能够将多个步骤合并为一个命令行。

    that do one job well, whereas large GUI programs pack rich and complex functionality
    into one large monolithic program.

  zh: • **Unix 哲学：** 传统的 Unix 哲学是创建简单的工具，每个工具只做一件事且做得好，而大型 GUI 程序则将丰富复杂的功能集成到一个庞大的单体程序中。

    using ssh. In some cases, remote shell access is your only choice, especially
    when you’re working with virtual or cloud-based servers or systems located in
    other cities or countries.

  zh: 在计算机书籍行业中，通常会将代码块和命令输出中的时间戳更改为发布后的未来某个时刻，以使内容看起来更新。我认为，写一本关于保持证据完整性的书，然后再通过将时间戳提前日期来篡改书中的证据并不合适。本书中所有的命令输出都反映了实际测试和研究中的输出，包括原始日期和时间戳。除了删除不太相关的部分（使用`...`）和去除多余的空行外，我保留了命令输出的原始内容。
- en: A bibliography is not provided at the end of the book. All references are included
    as footnotes at the bottom of the page where the source is referenced.

- en: The investigator’s or examiner’s workstation is referred to as the *acquisition
    host* or *examination host*. The disk and image that are undergoing acquisition
    are referred to as the *subject disk*, *suspect disk*, or *evidence disk*.

  zh: 调查员或检查员的工作站被称为*采集主机*或*检查主机*。正在进行采集的磁盘和镜像被称为*目标磁盘*、*嫌疑磁盘*或*证据磁盘*。
- en: A number of terms are used interchangeably throughout the book. *Disk*, *drive*,
    *media*, and *storage* are often used interchangeably when they’re used in a generic
    sense. *Forensic investigator*, *examiner*, and *analyst* are used throughout
    the book and refer to the person (you) using the examination host for various
    forensic tasks. *Imaging*, *acquisition*, and *acquiring* are used interchangeably,
    but the word *copying* is deliberately excluded to avoid confusion with regular
    copying outside the forensic context.

  zh: 本书中使用了多个互换的术语。*磁盘*、*驱动器*、*介质*和*存储*在泛指时通常可以互换使用。*法医调查员*、*检查员*和*分析员*在本书中被用于指代使用检查主机进行各种法医任务的人员（即你）。*镜像*、*采集*和*获取*是可以互换使用的，但故意排除了*复制*一词，以避免与法医背景外的普通复制产生混淆。

			<p class="ChapterIntro"><a id="431"/>Inkscape's 3D Box tool (<a href="c11.xhtml#section11.3.1">11.3.1</a>) is not intended as a replacement
for specialized 3D design applications. Inkscape is a drawing program, and its
3D Box tool is best used as a <em>drawing aid</em>, which is how we’ll use it in this simple tutorial.</p>
			<p>
				A <em>3D-correct</em> drawing is one that satisfies the rules of perspective that have been known to artists for centuries. It does not need to have
perfectly realistic shading and texturing; it just needs the lines and shapes to be approximately correct with regard to angles and dimensions.</p>
			<p>Intentional perspective distortions may well have an artistic value of their own, and some drawing styles don’t use perspective at all.
When necessary, many artists are capable of drawing 3D-correct art without any technical aid. However, quite often you will notice perspective errors—from barely
noticeable to embarrassing—in otherwise well-done pieces of art. I would love to see more artists—not only beginners—use
Inkscape's quick and easy way to set up the perspective for a drawing without tedious measurements and helper lines.</p>

				22.1 <a id="432"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_432" title="432"/>The Room</h2>
			<p>
				Let's draw a simple scene of two people meeting in a room. Switch to
the 3D Box tool (X) and drag in the middle of the canvas to draw the box for
the room. To see all sides of the box at once, enter it as a group (Ctrl-Enter), select all sides inside (Ctrl-A),
and set the <span class="ui"><strong>Opacity</strong></span> slider in the status bar (marked <span class="ui">O:</span>) to 50 percent, as shown in <a href="#fig22-1">Figure 22-1</a>. Then, leave the group (Ctrl-Backspace).</p>

			</figure>
			<p>
				Don't worry about getting the shape right on the first try; keep dragging the box’s handles
and, if necessary, the vanishing points to adjust what you've drawn. Use the corner handles to resize your room. The
four X/Y handles move in the X/Y plane by default and
along the Z axis when you press Shift. The four Z handles, conversely, move along the Z axis without Shift and in the X/Y plane
with Shift. The X-shaped central handle will move the entire room, again in
the X/Y plane without Shift and along the Z axis with Shift. When moving a handle in X/Y, press Ctrl to restrict its movement to one of the axes (only X or only
Y). Dragging the vanishing points will reslant and resize the entire room to fit the changed perspective (<a href="c11.xhtml#section11.3.3">11.3.3</a>).</p>
			<p>
				You can create a third vanishing point on the Y axis in addition to those in
X and Z. In other words, you can make the Y vanishing point <em>finite</em>. Do this if you want your
drawing to have a more dramatic or exaggerated perspective—as if viewed by a spider in
the corner of the room. Conversely, you can make the X and/or Y vanishing points infinite if you want a more detached,
"scientific" view from far away, as shown in <a href="#fig22-2">Figure 22-2</a>.</p>

				22.2 <a id="433"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_433" title="433"/>The Furniture</h2>
			<p>Let's add some furniture—for example, a sofa.</p>
			<p>
				When creating 3D box compositions, using snapping (<a href="c07.xhtml#section7.3">7.3</a>) is a convenient way to make 
boxes align precisely. On the snap controls bar (<a href="c07.xhtml#section7.3.1">7.3.1</a>), make sure you have
the following toggles on: <span class="ui">Enable snapping</span> (topmost), <span class="ui">Snap nodes, paths, and handles</span>, and <span class="ui">Snap to paths</span>.</p>
			<p>
				Now, draw a smaller box inside the larger one. (Here, "inside" refers to perspective;
in z-order, the boxes can be in any order so long as their sides are semitransparent and you can see the
edges of all boxes you created.) The new box will use the same perspective (the same vanishing points) as the room box. Grab the lower-left X/Y handle and
drag it so it snaps to the lower-left Z-edge of the room. That will be the base of
the sofa; use the other corner handles to give it the correct height, width, and depth (<a href="#fig22-3">Figure 22-3</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig22-3"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t04-03.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 22-3: The base of the sofa</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				For the back of the sofa, draw a new box and snap it into alignment in a
similar way; or, even easier, duplicate the base (Ctrl-D) and
drag its X/Y handles to resize it to the correct shape, as shown in <a href="#fig22-4">Figure 22-4</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig22-4"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t04-04.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 22-4: The back of the sofa</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Let's add two small basement windows on each
side of the sofa. A couple boxes flattened in the X dimension will make perfect
windows. However, how do you place them properly, given that no side of a window aligns
with a side of any other box?</p>
			<p>
				Again, the duplicate-then-resize trick is the easiest way to achieve this. Duplicate
the largest box you have—the room itself. Ctrl-drag its front X/Y
handle backward (along the X axis) to squeeze it into a thin layer; then, drag four handles
on the X/Y plane to resize the window into place. For a second window, duplicate
the first one and Shift-drag its central handle in the Z direction; this <a id="434"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_434" title="434"/>way, the
second window will be an exact perspective-aligned copy of the first one. Using the same
duplicate-and-flatten trick, add a doorway box on the Z-most wall (that is, the wall closest
to the Z vanishing point), so that it protrudes outside of the room box, as <a href="#fig22-5">Figure 22-5</a> demonstrates.</p>
			<a id="fig22-5"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t04-05.svg.png"/>

			<a id="section22.3"/>
			<h2>22.3 People</h2>
			<p>Let's draw two people, one standing by the sofa and the other in the
doorway. How can the 3D Box tool help with drawing humans? 
I'm not going to model robot-like constructions out of parallelepipeds, but I still
want the height and bulkiness of each figure to be correct in the drawing's
perspective, and an easy way to ensure this is with the 3D Box tool.</p>
			<p>Here’s how you do it. First, add a tall, narrow box in the doorway. This will be human 1. As before, duplicate the doorway box,
squeeze it on the sides in the X/Y plane, and resize it for a realistic proportion of the figure height and doorway height.
(Ask someone to stand in a real doorway to get an idea.)</p>
			<p>
				Then, duplicate the human 1 box. Using its X-shaped handle in the middle of this new human, Shift-drag it to the front,
then Ctrl-drag it horizontally a bit along the X axis. This will be the second human standing beside the sofa (<a href="#fig22-6">Figure 22-6</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig22-6"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t04-06.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 22-6: The two people</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="435"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_435" title="435"/>This way, both people boxes have the same perspective-adjusted height and will serve
as useful guides for actually drawing the human figures. If I were trying to achieve
even better anatomic fidelity, I could use a stack of three boxes for the legs, body,
and head for each human. (Unfortunately, you cannot drag several selected boxes in 3D space <em>at once</em>; you have to drag them one by one.)</p>
			<a id="section22.4"/><h2>22.4 Sketching and Coloring</h2>
			<p>
				Enough boxes! Put away the 3D Box tool, arm yourself with the
Calligraphic pen, and start sketching on top the 3D blueprint. Create a new layer (<span class="ui"><strong>Layer<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Add Layer</strong></span>) so you
can show and hide the 3D boxes and the drawing separately.</p>
			<p>
				Don't try to trace the edges of the boxes precisely. For nongeometric
objects, such as the sofa and humans, this is hardly possible, but even the walls
and windows will benefit from some hand-drawn roughness and imperfections. Use the edges
of the 3D boxes as general guides, but otherwise, <em>draw freely</em> (Inkscape's motto) in your own manner and style (<a href="#fig22-7">Figure 22-7</a>). You
certainly don't need to trace <em>all</em> of the lines; you can omit some and hint at others with short partial strokes.</p>
			<a id="fig22-7"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="tuts/t04-07.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 22-7: Sketching over the 3D blueprint</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				You will discover that the 3D boxes make it much easier to keep in mind the overall
composition and space relationships in your drawing while working on the details.
I won't go into details of the drawing process;
you’ve seen my sketching style with the Calligraphic pen in another tutorial (<a href="c21.xhtml#section21.6">21.6</a>).</p>
			<p>
				Once you're done with
the basic outlines, turn off the 3D layer to see how your image stands on its
own merits, as shown in <a href="#fig22-8">Figure 22-8</a>.</p>

layer.</p>

			<p><a id="436"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_436" title="436"/>Finally, colorize the drawing using 
wide blurred colored strokes underneath the dark crisp outlines, as <a href="#fig22-9">Figure 22-9</a> demonstrates.</p>

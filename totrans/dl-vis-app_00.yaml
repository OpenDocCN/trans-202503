    world today is the result of three developments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, computers are getting bigger and faster every year, and special-purpose
    chips originally intended for generating images are now powering AI techniques
    as well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, people keep developing new algorithms. Surprisingly, some of the algorithms
    powering AI today have been around for decades. They were more powerful than anyone
    knew and were just waiting for enough data and compute power to let them shine.
    Newer and even more powerful algorithms are now pushing the field forward at an
    increasingly rapid pace. Some of the most powerful algorithms used today belong
    to a category of AI called *deep learning*, and those are the techniques we’ll
    emphasize in this book.

- en: Third, and perhaps most critically, there are now massive databases for these
    algorithms to learn from. Social networks, streaming services, governments, credit
    card agencies, and even supermarkets measure and retain every crumb of information
    they can gather. Public data on the web is also vast. As of late 2020, estimates
    suggest there are more than 4 billion hours of video freely available online,
    over 17 billion images, and an untold amount of text covering topics from sports
    history to weather patterns to municipal records.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In practice, these databases are often seen as the most valuable component of
    any new machine learning system. After all, anyone with money can buy computers,
    and the algorithms they run are almost all publicly available in research journals,
    books, and open source repositories. It’s the data that organizations jealously
    hoard, to use for themselves, or to sell to the highest bidder. It’s no stretch
    to say that databases are the new oil, the new gold.

    advantages for the human race and dour predictors of doom who see nothing but
    ruin and the destruction of the societies and cultures that make up our world.
    Who is right? How can we judge the risks and rewards of this new technology? When
    should we embrace AI and when should we forbid it?

- en: The best way to thoughtfully deal with a new technology is to understand it.
    When we know how it works, and the nature of its powers and limitations, we can
    determine where and how it should be used to create a future we want to inhabit.
    This book exists to help you understand what deep learning is and how it works.
    When you know the strengths and weaknesses of deep learning, you’ll be in a better
    position to use it for your own work and understand its actual and potential impacts
    on our cultures and societies. It will also help you see when people and organizations
    that hold power are using these tools, and then determine for yourself whether
    they’re using them for your advantage, or their own.

    don’t need math or programming experience. You don’t need to be a computer whiz.
    You don’t have to be a technologist at all!

    You may be surprised that most of the algorithms of deep learning aren’t very
    complicated or hard to understand. They’re usually simple and elegant and gain
    their power by being repeated millions of times over huge databases.
  prefs: []

- en: In addition to satisfying pure intellectual curiosity (which I think is a fine
    reason to learn anything), I wrote this book for people who come face to face
    with deep learning, either in their own work or when interacting with others who
    use it. After all, one of the best reasons to understand AI is so we can use it
    ourselves! We can build AI systems now that help us do our work better, enjoy
    our hobbies more deeply, and understand the world around us more fully.

    words and pictures. That doesn’t mean the descriptions are sloppy or vague. Rather,
    I’ve worked hard to be as clear as possible, and, when appropriate, precise. When
    you’re done with this book, you’ll have a solid grasp of the general principles.
    If you later decide that you’d like to reframe your understanding in mathematical
    language, or write programs with a specific computer language or library, you’ll
    find it much easier than starting from scratch.

    One chapter addresses using Python’s free scikit-learn library, and the other
    two show how to build many of the deep learning systems we talk about in the book.
    With actual running code to build on and modify, you’ll be able to use existing
    networks or design and train your own networks for your own applications. The
    code is presented in the popular form of Jupyter notebooks, so it’s ready for
    your investigation, experimentation, adaptation, and use.

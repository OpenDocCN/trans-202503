    “In my experience, OpenBSD and other free systems tend to just work.”

- en: But for some reason, there’s a general perception that going with free software
    means that getting hardware components to work will be a serious struggle. In
    the past, there was some factual basis for this. I remember struggling to install
    FreeBSD 2.0.5 on the hardware I had available. I was able to boot off the installation
    CD, but the install never completed because my CD drive wasn’t fully supported.

- en: But that was back in June 1995, when PC CD drives usually came with an almost-but-not-quite
    IDE interface attached to a sound card, and cheap PCs didn’t come with networking
    hardware of any kind built in. Configuring a machine for network use usually meant
    moving jumpers around on the network interface card or the motherboard or running
    some weird proprietary setup software—if you had the good luck to be on a system
    that had or could be fitted with an Ethernet interface.

    in your system to work with OpenBSD. Sure, some caution and a bit of planning
    may be required for building the optimal setup, but that’s not necessarily a bad
    thing.

    functional hardware may come with odd restrictions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Quite a number of devices are designed to depend on firmware that must be loaded
    before the operating system can make use of the device. The motivation for this
    design choice is almost always to lower the cost of the device. When some manufacturers
    refuse to grant redistribution rights for the firmware, the decision becomes a
    problem because it means that operating systems like OpenBSD can’t package the
    firmware with their releases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Problems of this type have surfaced in connection with several types of hardware.
    In many cases, the manufacturers have been persuaded to change their minds and
    allow redistribution. However, this doesn’t happen in all cases. One example is
    the Intel-based wireless networking hardware that’s built into many popular laptop
    models. The hardware is supported in many operating systems, including OpenBSD
    via the `wpi` and `iwn` drivers. But even with those drivers in place, the hardware
    simply won’t work unless the user has manually fetched and installed the required
    firmware files. Once the install has completed and some sort of Internet connectivity
    is available, OpenBSD users can run the command `fw_update` to fetch and install
    or upgrade firmware for components the system recognizes as needing firmware files.

    make life easier for free software users everywhere and to boost sales. It’s possible
    that most situations like these will be resolved by the time you read this. Be
    sure to check the latest information online—and be prepared to vote with your
    wallet if a particular company refuses to act sensibly.

    you go to a physical store, make sure to tell the clerks you’ll be using a BSD.
    If you’re not sure about the parts they’re trying to sell you, ask to borrow a
    machine to browse the man pages and other documentation online. You might even
    ask for permission to boot a machine with the hardware you’re interested in from
    a CD or USB stick and study the `dmesg` output. Telling shop staff up front about
    your project could make it easier to get a refund if the part doesn’t work. And
    if the part does work, letting the vendor know is good advocacy. Your request
    could very well be the first time the seller has heard of your favorite operating
    system.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Systems such as OpenBSD and the other BSDs didn’t spring fully formed from the
    forehead of a deity (although some will argue that the process was not that different).
    Rather, they’re the result of years of effort by a number of smart and dedicated
    developers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: BSD developers are all highly qualified and extremely dedicated people who work
    tirelessly—the majority, in their spare time—to produce amazing results. However,
    they don’t live in a bubble with access to everything they need. The hardware
    itself or adequate documentation to support it is often unavailable to them. Another
    common problem is that documentation is often provided only under a nondisclosure
    agreement (NDA), which limits how developers can use the information.^([[51](#ftn.app02fn01)])
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Through *reverse engineering*, developers can write drivers to support hardware
    even without proper documentation, but the process is a complicated one that consists
    of educated guessing, coding, and testing until results begin to emerge. Reverse
    engineering takes a long time and—for reasons known only to lawmakers and lobbyists—it
    has legal consequences in several jurisdictions around the world.

    need encouragement. Write to them to tell them what you think they’re doing right
    and what they can do to improve. If, for example, a vendor has refused to make

    a reasoned, well-formulated letter from a potential customer could make the difference.'

    about how to do so at their websites.'

    to support the development of the BSDs. Your support will contribute to making
    more and better quality free software available for everyone.

- en: The title of Colleen M. Farrelly and Yaé Ulrich Gaba’s book, *The Shape of Data*,
    is as fitting and beautiful as the journey that the authors invite us to experience,
    as we discover the geometric shapes that paint the deeper meaning of our analytical
    data insights.

- en: Enabling and combining common machine learning, data science, and statistical
    solutions, including the combinations of supervised/unsupervised or deep learning
    methods, by leveraging topological and geometric data analysis provides new insights
    into the underlying data problem. It reminds us of our responsibilities as data
    scientists, that with any algorithmic approach a certain data bias can greatly
    skew our expected results. As an example, the data scientist needs to understand
    the underlying data context well to avoid performing a two-dimensional Euclidean-based
    distance analysis when the underlying data needs to account for three-dimensional
    nuances, such as what a routing analysis would require when traveling the globe.

- en: Throughout the book’s mathematical data analytics tour, we encounter the origin
    of data analysis on structured data and the many seemingly unstructured data scenarios
    that can be turned into structured data, which enables standard machine learning
    algorithms to perform predictive and prescriptive analytical insights. As we ride
    through the valleys and peaks of our data, we learn to collect features along
    the way that become key inputs into other data layers, forming geometrical interpretations
    of varying unstructured data sources including network data, images, and text-based
    data. In addition, Farrelly and Gaba are masterful in detailing the foundational
    and advanced concepts supported by the well-defined examples in both R and Python,
    available for download from their book’s web page.

- en: Throughout my opportunities to collaborate with Farrelly and Gaba on several
    exciting projects over the past years, I always hoped for a book to emerge that
    would explain as clearly and eloquently as *The Shape of Data* does the evolution
    of the topological data analysis space all the way to leveraging distributed and
    quantum computing solutions.

- en: During my days as a CTO at Cypher Genomics, Farrelly was leading our initiatives
    in genomic data analytics. She immediately inspired me with her keen understanding
    of how best to establish correlations between disease ontologies versus symptom
    ontologies, while also using simulations to understand the implications of missing
    links in the map. Farrelly’s pragmatic approach helped us successfully resolve
    critical issues by creating an algorithm that mapped across gene, symptom, and
    disease ontologies in order to predict disease from gene or symptom data. Her
    focus on topology-based network mining for diagnostics helped us define the underlying
    data network shape, properties, and link distributions using graph summaries and
    statistical testing. Our combined efforts around ontology mapping, graph-based
    prediction, and network mining and decomposition resulted in critical data network
    discoveries related to metabolomics, proteomics, gene regulatory networks, patient
    similarity networks, and variable correlation networks.

- en: From our joint genomics and related life sciences analytics days to our most
    recent quantum computing initiatives, Farrelly and Gaba have consistently demonstrated
    a strong passion and unique understanding of all the related complexities and
    how to apply their insights to several everyday problems. Joining them on their
    shape of data journey will be valuable time spent as you embark on a well-scripted
    adventure of R and Python algorithms that solve general or niche problems in machine
    learning and data analysis using geometric patterns to help shape the desired
    results.

- en: This book will be relevant and captivating to beginners and devoted experts
    alike. First-time travelers will find it easy to dive into algorithm examples
    designed for analyzing network data, including social and geographic networks,
    as well as local and global metrics, to understand network structure and the role
    of individuals in the network. The discussion covers clustering methods developed
    for use on network data, link prediction algorithms to suggest new edges in a
    network, and tools for understanding how, for example, processes or epidemics
    spread through networks.

    such as replacing linear algebra with nonlinear algebra in machine learning algorithms
    and exterior calculus to quantity needs in disaster planning. *The Shape of Data*
    has made me want to roll up my sleeves and dive into many new challenges, because
    I feel as well equipped as Lara Croft in *Tomb Raider* thanks to Farrelly’s tremendous
    treasure map and deeply insightful exploration work. Could there be a hidden bond
    or “hidden layer” between them?

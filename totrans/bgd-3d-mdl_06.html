<div class="image1"><img src="Images/common.jpg" alt="Images" width="246" height="245"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you’ll learn some tricks for modeling geometrically complex shapes. You’ll learn how to use the <em>Coil</em> and <em>Thread</em> tools, which are commonly used to make springs and screws. You’ll also learn about a way to model complex geometry using <em>surfaces</em>, which you’ll use to design a 20-sided die.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec72"><strong>Modeling a Coil</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The Coil tool creates helical, or spiral-shaped, forms. These could also be made with a sweep on a 3D spiral path, but the Coil tool is a lot easier to use. To make a hollow tube for a heat exchange coil, you might use two coils—one for a New Body and one for a Cut.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_74"/>To get started, select <strong>Coil</strong> from the <strong>Create</strong> drop-down menu. The software then asks you to choose a plane, which you should make perpendicular to the axis of the coil. The centerpoint of the coil’s cross-section will start at this plane. Draw a circle, like the one shown in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig1">Figure 7-1</a>, to specify the central axis and diameter of the coil.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch07fig1"/><img src="Images/07fig01.jpg" alt="Images" width="870" height="693"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 7-1: Select a point for the coil’s center axis and then draw a circle to specify the diameter.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">After you’ve set the circle’s diameter, the Coil dialog should pop up, and Fusion 360 should display a model with the default parameters.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Make sure the circle you just drew is selected as the profile. In the <strong>Type</strong> field, choose what kind of dimensions you want to use to create the coil. The default setting asks you to specify the coil’s revolution and height. The software will use these dimensions to calculate the coil’s <em>pitch</em>, or the distance along the axis needed for the coil to make a full revolution. You may want to switch the type if, for instance, you don’t care how many revolutions the coil makes but do care about the specific pitch.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Select <strong>Revolution and Height</strong> and then specify how many turns the coil should make in the <strong>Revolutions</strong> field. In the <strong>Height</strong> field, specify the coil’s nominal height, which is the distance from the centerpoint of the topmost cross-section to the centerpoint of the bottommost cross-section. Note that it is not asking you for the coil’s overall height. If your coil needed to be <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_75"/>exactly 100 mm tall, you would subtract the <em>Section Size</em> value, which is the diameter of the cross-section, from the Height value. In the <strong>Rotation</strong> field, set the coil to turn either clockwise or counterclockwise.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You already set the diameter when you drew the circle, but you can change it in the Diameter field. If you want the diameter to gradually increase or decrease, you can use the Angle field to give it a conical shape. Use <strong>Section</strong> to set the shape of the coil’s cross-section. You can choose to make it a circle, square, in-facing triangle, or out-facing triangle.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">By default, that cross-section will center itself on the diameter you select, but if you wanted your coil to fit around an existing part with that diameter, you would set the Section Position field to Outside and choose the part. If you wanted it to fit inside a cylinder with that diameter, you would change the field to Inside.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Take a few minutes to tweak the various parameters and watch how the model changes in response. <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig2">Figure 7-2</a> shows the dimensions I chose.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch07fig2"/><img src="Images/07fig02.jpg" alt="Images" width="925" height="525"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 7-2: Play around with your coil’s dimensions to get a feel for what the parameters do.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">That’s it—you’ve created a coil! Fusion 360 makes it as easy as that.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec73">Modeling a Screw Using the Thread Tool</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Although modeling a screw might seem easy, you’ll encounter difficulties if you try to do it with the tools you already know. That’s because the spiral-shaped ridge that runs along a screw’s body, called the <em>thread</em>, has very specific dimensions tailored to the screw’s purpose. For example, an orthopedic bone screw will have a completely different kind of thread than a machine screw. When modeling screws, you must define a thread’s major diameter, minor diameter, thread pitch, and thread angle, and it’s important to get it all right.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">On a traditional two-dimensional technical drawing, it’s rare for a drafter to bother drawing the threads of a screw. Instead, the drafter will just specify <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_76"/>the thread type—for example, 6 g M4×25 mm—so the manufacturer knows what kind of tap or screw to use. If you’re planning to buy threaded inserts and screws for your project, you’ll probably want to do the same. But if you want to print all your parts with a 3D printer, you’ll have to model the threads exactly as you want them to look. In the early days of 3D CAD, that meant precisely sketching the cross-section of each thread and modeling it with a helix feature similar to the Coil tool.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Fortunately for your sanity and patience, Fusion 360 gives you a tool that lets you skip all of that. The Thread tool contains a library of just about every thread commonly in use today. All you have to do is create a cylinder to put the threads on.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To see how it works, you’ll model an M4×25 mm screw. This is a very common screw; there are probably even a few of them in whatever computer you’re using to run Fusion 360.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec74"><strong><em>Creating the Body of the Screw</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Your screw model will have a variable length, so start by creating a Length parameter of 25 mm (<strong>Modify</strong> ▸ <strong>Change Parameters</strong> ▸ <strong>New User Parameter</strong>). Then draw a new sketch like the one shown in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig3">Figure 7-3</a> and set the fx: 25.00 dimension to the Length user parameter you made. The “fx:” in the dimension designates that the value has been calculated with a user parameter. Make the screw head 4 mm long and 3.5 mm wide.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch07fig3"/><img src="Images/07fig03.jpg" alt="Images" width="927" height="467"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 7-3: Create a sketch like this using your Length user parameter.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I’ve used the measurements of a standard socket-head cap screw, but the 1.5 mm dimension is completely arbitrary; when you add the threads, the software should automatically resize the width of the cylinder to fit the specifications of the threads. Once your sketch looks like that, revolve it around the bottom line to create a new body.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Like everything else on a standard fastener, this screw has a specific socket size, designed to fit a specific bit. We’ll use a 3 mm hex socket, as shown in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig4">Figure 7-4</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_77"/><a id="ch07fig4"/><img src="Images/07fig04.jpg" alt="Images" width="692" height="484"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 7-4: Draw an inscribed polygon for the socket head.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To model that, create a new sketch on the top of the head. In the <strong>Sketch</strong> menu, choose the <strong>Polygon</strong> option. This lets you create a polygon with any number of equal sides, like the one in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig4">Figure 7-4</a>. In the case of this hex cap screw, you’ll need six sides. <em>Circumscribed</em> defines it by the diameter of an imaginary circle that touches the midpoints of each edge, while <em>Inscribed</em> defines it by the diameter of an imaginary circle that touches the vertices. Choose <strong>Circumscribed</strong> and make the diameter 3 mm.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec75"><strong><em>Modeling the Thread</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Now you can create the threads themselves by choosing <strong>Thread</strong> from the <strong>Create</strong> menu. You should see the dialog shown in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig5">Figure 7-5</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch07fig5"/><img src="Images/07fig05.jpg" alt="Images" width="925" height="556"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 7-5: Choose your Thread dialog options based on the fastener type you require.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_78"/>Select the face of the cylinder and then check <strong>Modeled</strong> to make the threads appear there. (If you leave the Modeled option unchecked, Fusion 360 will just store the thread information for a later technical drawing.) Because we want the threads to span the full length of the cylinder, check <strong>Full Length</strong>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The rest of the options allow you to pick a specific kind of thread. For the <strong>Thread Type</strong>, choose <strong>ISO Metric Profile</strong>. Set <strong>Size</strong> to 4.0 mm and <strong>Designation</strong> to M4×0.5. The Class setting determines how much tolerance to give. We’ll use 6 g here. Finally, because this is a standard screw, set <strong>Direction</strong> to <strong>Right Hand</strong>. Almost all fasteners use right-hand threads, which you tighten by turning clockwise, but you might occasionally have a need for left-hand threads, which you tighten by turning counterclockwise.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Your model should now look like a real screw, with built-in threads. As a final step, give the screw’s tip a <em>revolved cut</em> to make it easier to insert. I gave mine a 45-degree cut that starts 1.5 mm from the center axis, but this is one of the few parts of a fastener without rigid specifications, so you can make the dimensions whatever you’d like. In the end, your model should look something like the one shown in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig6">Figure 7-6</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch07fig6"/><img src="Images/07fig06.jpg" alt="Images" width="904" height="443"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 7-6: Your model should have a revolved cut at the end to make it easier to insert.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Congratulations! You’ve finished modeling your first screw.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec76">Modeling a 20-Sided Die</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Unfortunately, Fusion 360 can’t offer a dedicated tool for every complicated design. In this section, you learn how to model a die with 20 sides by using Surfaces, as well as the geometrical concept of golden rectangles, to break the task into manageable steps.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Called regular icosahedrons or, colloquially, d20s, these dice are popular in tabletop role-playing games like <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. The die consists of 20 identical equilateral triangles joined so that the vertices all touch the same imaginary sphere. Five faces meet at each vertex, as shown in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig7">Figure 7-7</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_79"/><a id="ch07fig7"/><img src="Images/07fig07.jpg" alt="Images" width="651" height="487"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 7-7: You’ll be modeling this 20-sided (d20) die.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In geometric terms, the die is quite complex; even using a formula to calculate the length of the triangles’ edges would be tricky for people who aren’t math whizzes. Fortunately, we can express the geometry in a far simpler way using golden rectangles.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Golden rectangles have dimensions that follow the golden ratio, meaning that their lengths are approximately 1.618 times their widths. <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig8">Figure 7-8</a> shows three interlocking golden rectangles placed perpendicular to one another.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch07fig8"/><img src="Images/07fig08.jpg" alt="Images" width="672" height="625"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 7-8: A 20-sided die formed by three golden rectangles</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_80"/>When arranged like this, the rectangles’ corners form the 12 vertices of the die. The die has 20 sides with 3 corners each, equaling 60. Since 5 sides share the same vertex, there are 12 vertices in total.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you draw lines between the corners of the rectangle nearest to one another, you form the die’s edges. For modeling purposes, we can use those edges to create surfaces for each of the 20 faces. You can then stitch the surfaces together to create a single solid body.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To work with surfaces, switch to the <strong>Patch</strong> workspace, which gives you access to tools in the Create and Modify drop-down menus that you haven’t seen yet. Otherwise, this workspace looks the same as the Model workspace.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Use the sketch tools you’re already familiar with to draw the three golden rectangles—one on each of the existing planes. Make sure they’re oriented the way they appear in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig9">Figure 7-9</a>. Give them each a height of 10 mm and a width of 16.18 mm.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch07fig9"/><img src="Images/07fig09.jpg" alt="Images" width="923" height="740"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 7-9: Draw three perpendicular golden rectangles.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Next, we need to draw lines connecting the corners of the rectangles to form the edges of the die’s faces. To do that, we first need to create construction planes to sketch them on. From the <strong>Construct</strong> drop-down, choose the <strong>Plane Through Three Points</strong> option. Select three points that will make up the vertices of a single triangular face, as shown in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig10">Figure 7-10</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_81"/><a id="ch07fig10"/><img src="Images/07fig10.jpg" alt="Images" width="922" height="615"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 7-10: Create a construction plane that touches the three vertices of a triangular face.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now draw a new sketch on the plane you just created. Use lines to connect the same three points you selected for the plane itself. You should end up with an equilateral triangle like the one in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig11">Figure 7-11</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch07fig11"/><img src="Images/07fig11.jpg" alt="Images" width="716" height="684"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 7-11: Draw a sketch that connects the three points to form a triangle.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_82"/>Now you’re ready to make your first surface. Surfaces have no thickness, so they’re not solid bodies like the features you’ve used so far in this book. Although they have no actual substance on their own, you can connect multiple surfaces to create a solid body.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To model your first surface, select <strong>Patch</strong> from the <strong>Create</strong> menu. This should open the dialog shown in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig12">Figure 7-12</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch07fig12"/><img src="Images/07fig12.jpg" alt="Images" width="925" height="493"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 7-12: Use the Patch feature to create a surface from the three lines of the triangle.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Use the three lines of the triangle you just drew as <em>boundary edges</em>. Select <strong>Enable Chaining</strong>. Ignore the Interior Rails/Points option; you won’t need these for this project. Set the Continuity drop-down menu to <strong>Connected</strong> and the Operation drop-down menu to <strong>New Body</strong>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Once you click OK, you should have a single triangular surface—one side of the die. Now, repeat that process 19 more times to generate all of the faces. (Yes, it’s a little tedious.)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you lose track of which points you’re supposed to connect, reference <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig8">Figure 7-8</a>. All edges should be equal in length, so if you end up with an edge of a different length, you’ve connected the wrong points. In the end, you should have a shape composed of 20 individual faces, as shown in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig13">Figure 7-13</a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The model now <em>looks</em> like a d20, but it’s not really a solid body yet. As noted, the surfaces have no thickness. If you tried to export this as an STL file for 3D printing, Fusion 360 wouldn’t let you—there just isn’t anything there to convert into a mesh.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Fusion 360 provides the <em>Stitch</em> feature to turn multiple surfaces into a single solid body. For this feature to work, the surfaces must come together to form an airtight body. If you had only made 19 of the 20 faces, the Stitch feature would fail because of the missing face.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_83"/><a id="ch07fig13"/><img src="Images/07fig13.jpg" alt="Images" width="790" height="724"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 7-13: Keep creating triangular surfaces until you have all 20 faces.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Since you’ve got all 20 faces, go ahead and choose <strong>Stitch</strong> from the <strong>Modify</strong> menu; then select all of the surfaces, as shown in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig14">Figure 7-14</a>. After you select all 20 surfaces and click OK, Fusion 360 should “stitch” together the surfaces and turn the set into a solid body.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch07fig14"/><img src="Images/07fig14.jpg" alt="Images" width="927" height="519"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 7-14: Use the Stitch feature to convert your surfaces into a solid body.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_84"/>The final step is to add fillets to the edges, because nobody wants a d20 with sharp corners. To do that, switch back to the <strong>Model</strong> workspace. Then, use the <strong>Fillet</strong> tool by selecting all the edges and setting a radius of 1 mm. When you’re done, your die should look like the one in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig15">Figure 7-15</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch07fig15"/><img src="Images/07fig15.jpg" alt="Images" width="679" height="521"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 7-15: Your finished d20 should look like this.</em></p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec77"><strong>Exercises</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Try your hand at the following exercises to get some practice with a couple of minor tools Fusion 360 has to offer.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec78"><strong><em>Changing the Size of Your d20</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">When you started modeling the d20, I gave you the dimensions of your golden rectangles. I chose those dimensions to make the math easy, but you may want your d20 to be a different size—with, say, a distance of 75 mm between two opposing faces. Of course, you could figure out how the dimensions of the rectangles relate to the distance between the faces of the die and then change the rectangles’ dimensions accordingly, but it’s far easier to just resize the final model.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you measure the distance between opposite parallel faces using the Measure tool from the Inspect menu, you’ll find that it’s something like 15.114974 mm. (This will differ very slightly between faces, because 1:1.618 is actually just an approximation of the golden ratio. Like pi, the golden ratio is an irrational number and continues infinitely past the decimal point. For real-world use, 1:1.618 works fine.)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We want the distance between opposite faces to be 75 mm, so about 4.961967 times what it is now. To make that happen, choose the <strong>Scale</strong> feature from the <strong>Modify</strong> menu and select the model. Keep <strong>Scale Type</strong> set to <strong>Uniform</strong>, as shown in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig16">Figure 7-16</a>, and set the <strong>Scale Factor</strong> to <strong>4.961967</strong>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_85"/><a id="ch07fig16"/><img src="Images/07fig16.jpg" alt="Images" width="927" height="464"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 7-16: Scale the model to make it 75 mm between opposite faces.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Click <strong>OK</strong> to resize the d20. Measure the opposite faces again. The distance should be almost exactly 75 mm (by any reasonable tolerance).</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec79"><strong><em>Inscribing Numbers</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">If you want to actually 3D print your giant d20 to impress the dungeon master at your next D&amp;D session, you have to add numbers, or else you’ll find it pretty difficult to use. To add them, choose the <strong>Text</strong> option from the <strong>Sketch</strong> menu and position your text; then extrude it as with any other sketch to cut lightly into the face. I did this to the “20” shown in <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07fig17">Figure 7-17</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch07fig17"/><img src="Images/07fig17.jpg" alt="Images" width="691" height="651"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 7-17: Add numbers to the faces of the die by extruding the text.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_86"/>Repeat that process for all 20 numbers. Statistically, it doesn’t matter how you number the faces—all sides of the die have an equal chance of coming up—but there is a convention for doing so. Pick a random side, and place 1 there. Then, on the opposite side, place 20. On a face adjacent to 20, place 2. Then opposite that, place 19. Adjacent to 19, place 3, and so on. In the end, the sum of any two opposite faces should always equal 21.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec80"><strong>Summary</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The modeling in this chapter ranged from trivial to pretty darn difficult, but hopefully you’ve learned that even projects that seem overwhelmingly complex at first glance can be broken down into manageable steps. With the skills you’ve picked up so far in this book, you should be able to create 3D models of just about anything you can imagine, as long as you take the time to think through how you’ll approach it step by step.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now you know how to use all of the most important modeling tools. In <a href="ch08.xhtml#ch08">Chapter 8</a>, you’ll learn how to create technical drawings, which will be useful if you’d like your models to be built. In <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09">Chapter 9</a>, you’ll learn how to make nice-looking renders of your models for presentation purposes.</p>&#13;

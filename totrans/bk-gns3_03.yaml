    second step is configuration. Fortunately, GNS3 has never been easier to configure,
    and you need to perform only a few tasks. In this chapter, I’ll cover the basic
    GNS3 configuration options you need to get IOS routers up and running using Dynamips.

- en: Before you can boot up a router, you’ll need to install and configure at least
    one Cisco IOS image file in GNS3, though you’re on your own when it comes to acquiring
    one. IOS is the intellectual property of Cisco Systems and not ordinarily available
    to the public. Additionally, because the GNS3 developers have no affiliation with
    Cisco, they can’t legally supply you with an IOS image either (so please don’t
    ask).

- en: The simplest way to acquire an IOS image file is to copy an image from a Cisco
    router that you own. The upside to this approach is that you’re not stealing an
    image; you already have an IOS image that’s licensed for your router. The downside
    is that GNS3 supports only a few models out of the hundreds that Cisco manufactures,
    and your router may not be one of them. (See [Appendix B](apb.html "Appendix B. Cisco
    Hardware Compatible with GNS3") for a complete list of compatible Cisco routers
    and hardware configurations.)

    memory to an FTP server. If you don’t know the name of your IOS image file, you
    can use the `show flash` command on your router. In the following example, the
    IOS image filename is *c7200-ios-version.bin*; my FTP server is running on a PC
    with the IP address 192.168.1.25, and my FTP username and password are *jason*

    ways to find IOS image files, as you’ll surely find with a simple Internet search.
    While companies like Cisco and Juniper have turned a blind eye to this sort of
    thing in the past (as long as the software is used only for educational purposes),
    you may not want to use a bootleg version of Cisco IOS. Such images may work just
    fine, but there’s always the possibility that they contain malware or have been
    tampered with in unexpected ways.

    try swapping the IOS for a different version because this often corrects the problem.

    Recommended IOS versions are c36xx, c37xx, and c7200 (but not the c7200p) because
    these are the most stable versions for Dynamips and GNS3\. Consider the IOS version
    number, as well. While new IOS versions provide the latest bells and whistles,
    older versions tend to use fewer PC resources, such as processor power and memory.
    If you’re creating simple projects for CCNA study, you might want to use an older
    IOS from the 12.2 or 12.3 train to conserve resources, but if you’re studying
    for your CCIE, you might need to install the newest IOS available.

- en: The Memory usage optimisation settings are all about conserving memory in your
    PC. The less memory Dynamips uses per router, the more routers you can add to
    your projects. The Enable ghost IOS support option reduces memory consumption
    in your PC by allocating one shared region of memory that multiple routers can
    use, as long as they’re running the same IOS image. This is a good reason to use
    the same router model multiple times in a project; using several different models,
    with different IOS versions, will eat up more of your PC’s memory. The Enable
    mmap support option allows the contents of router memory to be written to a file
    on your hard drive, similar to a cache or swap file. The Enable sparse memory
    support option reduces the amount of virtual memory used by your routers so you
    can run more router instances per Dynamips process.

    usage will quickly spike to 100 percent and remain there. This happens because
    Dynamips doesn’t yet know whether your virtual router is doing something that
    requires system resources, so it overcompensates by giving it all the resources
    it can. GNS3 will run sluggishly until this is corrected, and if CPU usage is

    where an idle loop exists (idle loops cause the CPU to spike); the result of this

    Dynamips should periodically *sleep* the router when these idle loops are executed,

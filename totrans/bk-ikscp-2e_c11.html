			<p class="ChapterIntro"><a id="199"/>The freedom to do anything to anything, any time, 
is what makes vector graphics so attractive. With a small vocabulary of generic object types and 
tools for manipulating them, you can render, or at least approximate, any kind of graphic
imaginable.</p>
			<p>
				Absolute freedom is not always a good thing, however. For example, a path (<a href="c12.xhtml#ch12">Chapter 12</a>)
can represent any possible two-dimensional shape. Yet often, what you need is not "any shape"
but a simple, well-defined geometric entity, such as a rectangle. Of
course, a four-node path will give you a perfect rectangle—but isn't there a
faster and more convenient way to create, specifically, rectangles?</p>
			<p>
				Indeed, Inkscape has several object types for commonly used geometric
shapes: rectangles, 3D boxes, ellipses, polygons, stars, and spirals. Each shape type
has a corresponding creation tool, and Inkscape provides an array of numeric parameters,
draggable handles, and shortcuts for manipulating those shapes. You cannot do<em>everything</em> to such a shape object, but what you <em>can</em> do to it makes perfect
sense for its specific shape type.</p>

					<h2>Inkscape's Shapes vs. AI's Live Shapes</h2>
					<p><a id="200"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_200" title="200"/>Shape tools in Inkscape are similar to the "live shapes" tools in the latest versions of Adobe Illustrator. It's interesting that AI

				You can always press Shift-Ctrl-C to convert a shape to a path (or, in the
case of a 3D box, to a group). The reverse conversion, however, is not possible (at
least not automatically). This means that a shape is a <em>higher level of abstraction</em> than
a path: converting a shape to a path causes information loss and is therefore a one-way,
destructive operation.</p>

					<h2>Shapes in SVG</h2>
					<p>
						SVG has its own shape elements for rectangles, ellipses, circles, and polygons. However, Inkscape's
shapes are richer than what is defined in the SVG standard. As a result, Inkscape uses, as a fallback,
the generic <code>path</code> element with some Inkscape-specific attributes whenever it cannot
express the required shape using pure SVG. Details depend on the specific shape.
Inkscape's rectangles are always represented by the <code>rect</code> SVG element; ellipses and circles
start as <code>ellipse</code> and <code>circle</code> but are automatically switched to <code>path</code>
when you turn them into arcs or segments (<a href="#section11.4.2">11.4.2</a>); and stars, polygons, and spirals always use<code>path</code>.</p>

			<h2>11.1 Shape Tools</h2>
			<p>
				To create a new shape object, drag on the canvas with the
corresponding tool—for example, dragging with the Rectangle tool creates a new
rectangle. The newly created shape remains selected, and any selected shape displays its
editing <em>handles</em> (similar in appearance to the gradient handles, <a href="c10.xhtml#section10.1">10.1</a>). By dragging those handles, 
you can immediately edit what you have created.</p>
			<p>Most handles work differently when you drag them with or without various keyboard
modifiers (Ctrl, Shift, Alt). Hover your mouse over
a handle to read a tip, in the status bar, on what this handle will do when dragged or clicked with
different modifiers.</p>
			<p>
				Like most tools, shape tools have certain object selection capabilities. In any
shape tool, you can select an object (not necessarily a shape) by clicking—which works like
Ctrl-clicking in the Selector tool (that is, ignores any grouping,<a href="c05.xhtml#section5.10">5.10</a>). Alt-click (select under, <a href="c05.xhtml#section5.9">5.9</a>)
works but Alt-wheel does not; Shift-click (add to selection or
remove from selection) works, but the rubberband does not (because
dragging creates a new shape). Escape deselects.</p>
			<p>
				To <em>create</em> a rectangle, you need to use the Rectangle tool—but <em>editing</em> a shape
is another matter. <em>Any</em> shape object, when selected, lets you drag its shape-specific handles in <em>any</em>
shape tool, as well as in the Node tool (F2). When you have <em>multiple</em> shapes selected,
however, only the Node tool lets you edit any of their handles.</p>
			<a id="section11.1.1"/><h3>
				11.1.1 <a id="201"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_201" title="201"/>Shape Parameters</h3>
			<p>
				Each shape tool has its own controls bar (<a href="c02.xhtml#section2.3">2.3</a>) where you can view and edit
parameters. Usually, there are a few numeric entry fields and toggle buttons,
as well as a button to reset the values to the defaults (located to the right of all the other controls).</p>
			<p>
				The leftmost label on the controls bar says either <span class="ui">New:</span> or <span class="ui">Change:</span> before all other controls.
"New" means that no shape of the corresponding type is selected, so the parameters you're 
editing will be used for a new shape when you create it.
"Change" indicates that the selection contains shapes
of the current tool's type—to which your parameter change will therefore apply.</p>
			<p>
				Any changes made to these controls are remembered and used for the next object you
draw with that tool—just as the style properties you assign to an object are typically
used for the next created object (<a href="#section11.1.2">11.1.2</a>). For example, after you change the
number of corners of a star, any new stars you draw will have the same number of corners.</p>
			<p>
				Moreover, even simply selecting a shape sends its parameters to the controls bar,
where those parameters are remembered and later used for newly created shapes of that
type. This makes it easy to reuse shape parameters—similar to pasting a style from object to object (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.1">8.1</a>)
but without using copy and paste. For example, if you have a slightly rounded star with nine corners and no randomization somewhere in your drawing,
simply select that star in the Star tool and subsequent stars will be created with exactly the same parameters.</p>
			<a id="section11.1.2"/><h3>11.1.2 The Style of New Shapes</h3>
			<p>
				What style is going to be used for the next shape you create? You can find the answer
to this question by looking at the far right end of the controls bar. All shape tools—in fact, all object-creating tools—have
a style swatch there displaying the fill, stroke, and opacity that will be used for the newly created objects (<a href="#fig11-1">Figure 11-1</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig11-1"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="12/sha-newstyle.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 11-1: This style will be used for newly created shapes.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				By default, all shape tools except Spiral use the <em>last set style</em> as the style
of new objects they create. This means that every time you change some style property in
an object, Inkscape remembers that property and will use it for new shapes. For example,
after you paint something green, all new rectangles, ellipses, stars, and so on will have
the same shade of green. Or if you assign a 3 px stroke width with a 1:1 dash pattern to
some path or shape, new shapes will also have that stroke style. (This behavior becomes more
complex for 3D boxes, which use not one but six different styles for the six sides of a
box; see <a href="#section11.3.5">11.3.5</a> for details.)</p>
			<p>
				If you don't want the most recently set style to be used for new objects, you can change
that. Double-click a shape tool's button in the toolbox on the left <a id="202"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_202" title="202"/>to open that
tool's page in the <span class="ui">Preferences</span> dialog (<a href="c03.xhtml#section3.1.1">3.1.1</a>), as shown in <a href="#fig11-2">Figure 11-2</a>.
There, use the two-way switch to set the
style of new objects either to the <em>last used style</em> or a fixed <em>tool style</em> specific
to this tool. To change the tool style, click the <span class="ui"><strong>Take from selection</strong></span> button
to remember the style of the current selection as the tool style.</p>

				<img alt="" src="12/sha-toolprefs.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 11-2: A shape tool's preferences page</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				For example, if you want all new rectangles to be black without stroke,
select some black strokeless object, go to <span class="ui"><strong>Preferences<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Tools<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Shapes<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Rectangle</strong></span>, switch 
to <span class="ui"><strong>This tool's own style</strong></span>, and click <span class="ui"><strong>Take from selection</strong></span>.</p>
			<a id="section11.2"/><h2>11.2 Rectangles</h2>
			<p><em>Rectangles</em>, boring as they may sound, are the most commonly used type of
shape. You'll be hard-pressed to find a design not dominated by rectangles. Inkscape
makes creating and editing rectangles as easy and versatile as possible.</p>
			<p>
				Switch to the Rectangle tool (by clicking the toolbar button on the left or by
pressing R or F4) and drag anywhere on the
canvas, as shown in <a href="#fig11-3">Figure 11-3</a>. Drag with Ctrl to get a square or an integer-ratio (2:1, 3:1, and so
on) rectangle; drag with Shift to make the starting point the rectangle's
center instead of one of the corners. You can combine Ctrl and Shift.</p>
			<a id="fig11-3"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="12/sha-rectdraw.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 11-3: Drawing rectangles</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="203"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_203" title="203"/>The new rectangle displays four handles, as shown in <a href="#fig11-4">Figure 11-4</a>. Two are little squares in the top-left and
bottom-right corners; these are the <em>sizing handles</em>. The two others, which appear as little circles, are <em>rounding
handles</em>; they are both in the top-right corner and
look like one handle until you drag one of them away.</p>
			<a id="fig11-4"/><figure>

				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 11-4: Rectangle handles</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<a id="section11.2.1"/>
			<h3>11.2.1 Sizing</h3>
			<p>
				Using the sizing handles, you can resize the rectangle simply by <em>dragging</em>
any of the sides in any direction. Dragging with Ctrl locks the width, height, or width/height ratio by snapping the handle to 
the rectangle's sides or to the diagonal.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>Unlike the Selector tool, you cannot move, for example, the bottom-right sizing
handle further up or further to the left than the top-left handle. The most you can do 
is make the rectangle invisible by reducing its width, its height, or both to zero.</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>
				In the controls bar, two numeric controls labeled <span class="ui">W</span> and <span class="ui">H</span>
also control the width and height of the selected rectangle. They use the measurement
unit chosen in the unit selector on the right.</p>
			<p>
				Why use the sizing handles when you can just as easily resize the rectangle with
the Selector tool?  The Selector tool always scales things horizontally or
vertically in the document coordinate system—that is, along the edges of the page. In
contrast, a rectangle's sizing handles scale it <em>along the sides</em> of that
rectangle, even if the rectangle was rotated or skewed. The <span class="ui">W</span> and <span class="ui">H</span>
values also always reflect a rectangle's intrinsic width and height, not necessarily the
dimensions of its bounding box, which may be quite different if the rectangle was rotated
or skewed (<a href="#fig11-5">Figure 11-5</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig11-5"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="12/sha-rectsizing.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 11-5: Rectangle sizing handles vs. scaling with
the Selector tool</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="204"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_204" title="204"/>Another advantage of the sizing handles is that they always preserve the 
radii of the rectangle's rounded corners (although, as you'll see shortly, this is possible with the Selector
as well).</p>
			<p>
				As with any other shape type, you can make handles of rectangles snap (<a href="c07.xhtml#section7.3">7.3</a>) to grids,
guides, and other objects. If you start from a particularly rotated and/or
skewed rectangle and enable snapping of nodes to paths, nodes, and intersections,
it's easy to use duplication (Ctrl-D) and sizing handles to create
snugly fitting, gapless compositions of axonometric rectangles, as shown in <a href="#fig11-6">Figure 11-6</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig11-6"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="12/sha-rectsnap.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 11-6: Snapping slanted rectangles to each other</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				What snaps is the <em>mouse point</em>, not necessarily the handle itself. These
two may diverge quite far if, for example, you are resizing a rectangle with
Ctrl to lock its width or height. In <a href="#fig11-6">Figure 11-6</a>, I wanted to make
the leftmost rectangle narrower but keep its height, so I moved the handle with
Ctrl from A to B. However, I also wanted this rectangle to abut the left edge
(marked by a bold line) of rectangle D. So, while dragging and without letting go of
Ctrl, I moved the mouse cursor to point C so it snapped to the edge I needed (the
actual handle was then at B), and there I released the mouse. To make this possible, I enabled nodes
and handles as snappables and paths as snap targets (<a href="c07.xhtml#section7.3">7.3</a>).</p>
			<a id="section11.2.2"/><h3>11.2.2 Rounding</h3>
			<p>
				To round corners of a rectangle, grab one of the circular rounding handles and drag it along the side of the
rectangle. All four corners of the rectangle become rounded by circular arcs. Also, now
you can see the second rounding handle—it remains in its original position in the
corner (<a href="#fig11-7">Figure 11-7</a>). If <em>circular</em> rounded corners are what you need, you can leave it at
that. If you want <em>elliptic</em> corners instead, move that other handle away from the
corner along the other side of the rectangle.</p>
			<a id="fig11-7"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="12/sha-rectround.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 11-7: Rectangle rounding handles</p>

			</figure>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">

				</div>
				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p><a id="205"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_205" title="205"/>Even circular rounding can look elliptic if the rectangle is skewed (compare <a href="c24.xhtml#section24.3">24.3</a>).</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>
				Using the <span class="ui">Rx</span> and <span class="ui">Ry</span> numeric fields in the controls bar, you can
explicitly set both rounding radii in absolute units (chosen with
the unit selector to the right). If multiple rectangles are selected, the value you type
will apply to all of them (if any non-rectangles are selected, they will be
ignored). The button with a corner icon on the right removes any rounding from the
selected rectangles.</p>
			<p>The maximum distance you can move the rounding handles is half the length of the
corresponding rectangle size. Reaching this maximum with both rounding handles
effectively turns a square into a circle and a non-square into an ellipse.</p>
			<p>
				In technical drawings such as schemes and diagrams, the size and shape of 
rounded corners often needs to be the same in the entire composition, even if the sizes of the
rectangles are different. Inkscape makes this easy. The second of the four<span class="ui">Affect</span> buttons on the Selector toolbar (<a href="c06.xhtml#section6.11">6.11</a>), the one with two concentric
rounded corners, controls whether the rounded corners are scaled when a rectangle is
scaled. <a href="#fig11-8">Figure 11-8</a> shows
a bunch of rounded rectangles scaled with this
button on and off.</p>

				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 11-8: Scaling a rectangle may or may not
affect its rounding radii.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>Here are the shortcuts for the rounding handles of a rectangle:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Drag with Ctrl to make the rounding circular (that is, 
make the other radius the same).</li>
				<li>Ctrl-click a handle to make the rounding circular without dragging.</li>
				<li>Shift-click a handle to remove rounding.</li>
			</ul><a id="section11.3"/>
			<h2>11.3 3D Boxes</h2>
			<p>
				A <em>3D box</em> is an object representing a projection of a three-dimensional box
(rectangular prism) onto the plane of the drawing. It therefore consists of six<em>sides</em>, and from a pure SVG viewpoint, it is simply a group of six paths, each
with four nodes and four linear segments.
Inkscape, however, treats these objects in a special way—so you can, for example, resize and
move them in their own 3D space or reposition the vanishing points of multiple boxes at once.</p>
			<p><a id="206"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_206" title="206"/>Apart from the 3D Box tool, most other tools and commands treat a 3D box as a
group. In particular, in
the Selector tool, you can Ctrl-click, Ctrl-Alt-click, or Alt-drag
to select any side within the box (most often for changing its style), just as
you would select objects inside a group. Selecting sides inside a box does not destroy the box; however,
you can easily "unbox" it with the <span class="ui">Path<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Object to Path</span> (Shift-Ctrl-C) command—this
removes any 3D-specific capabilities and leaves you with a regular group with paths inside.
You can also simply <span class="ui">Ungroup</span> (Ctrl-U) a 3D box.</p>
			<a id="section11.3.1"/><h3>11.3.1 Why Use 3D Boxes?</h3>
			<p>What makes such a specialized construct as a 3D box useful?</p>
			<p>
				Inkscape is not going to replace a full-featured 3D
application—it does not model a "true" three-dimensional space in which you 
could place your 3D objects. Inkscape is and always will be a two-dimensional drawing
tool. However, it is often used to draw three-dimensional objects. To assist in this,
Inkscape implements a simple, 2D-oriented system of <em>perspective drawing</em>—whose principles
have remained unchanged since being perfected by the Renaissance artists six centuries ago.</p>
			<p>
				In Inkscape, you don't "build a 3D world"; you just create a flat drawing that
represents a three-dimensional scene in a certain perspective. Inkscape's 3D Box tool is
mostly a helper that makes creating such perspective drawings easier. In perspective
drawing, a box is almost as important as a rectangle is for two-dimensional drawing and
layout; drawing anything in correct perspective usually starts with drawing its
enclosing box. So Inkscape's 3D boxes are often used not for their own sake but
as quick and 3D-accurate guides for your perspective drawing—something to align
your objects against and to inscribe them into (see <a href="c22.xhtml">Chapter 22</a> for an example).</p>
			<p>
				On the other hand, the ease of creating and reshaping 3D boxes in Inkscape is an
inspiration in itself. The <span class="ui">About</span>
screen (<span class="ui">Help<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>About</span>) of Inkscape 0.46 (in which this tool made its debut)
is an example of a piece of art dominated by 3D boxes 
shown in <a href="#fig11-9">Figure 11-9</a>.</p>

			<h3>
				11.3.2 <a id="207"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_207" title="207"/>Drawing</h3>
			<p>
				To draw a 3D box, switch to the 3D Box tool (the X key or Shift-F4) and
drag somewhere within the page frame (because the default vanishing points are on the left and right edges of the page).
This creates the front side of the box in the X/Y
plane; the depth of the box along the Z axis remains fixed. 
To switch to the Z axis, drag with Shift; this freezes the X/Y side 
but lets you adjust the depth, as shown in <a href="#fig11-10">Figure 11-10</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig11-10"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="12/sha-3ddraw.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 11-10: Drawing a 3D box</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Once a box is created, it displays a diamond-shaped handle in each of the eight corners as well as an X-shaped handle in the
center. Also, colored lines go from the edges of the box to the vanishing points. Let's
look at these controls in detail.</p>
			<a id="section11.3.3"/><h3>11.3.3 Perspective and Vanishing Points</h3>
			<p>
				Each 3D box exists in a certain <em>perspective</em>, which is defined by three<em>vanishing points</em>, corresponding to the three spatial dimensions: X (red guides),
Y (blue guides), and Z (yellow guides). Each vanishing point may be either <em>finite</em>
(it is an actual handle that you can drag around) or <em>infinite</em> (it is just a direction
toward a point at infinity; you can change the angle of this direction).</p>
			<p>
				By default, the X and Z vanishing points are finite, located in the middle of the left
and right edges of your document's page. The Y vanishing point is infinite, its
direction being vertical, as shown in <a href="#fig11-11">Figure 11-11</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig11-11"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="12/sha-3dvp.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 11-11: The default perspective</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>You can toggle the finite/infinite status of each dimension's vanishing point using the three buttons in the tool's control bar.
The finite vanishing points
can be dragged freely on the canvas. The angles of the infinite ones can
be adjusted numerically in the controls bar or by the shortcuts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>[ and ] rotate X vanishing point directions.</li>
				<li>( and ) rotate Y vanishing point directions.</li>
				<li>{ and } rotate Z vanishing point directions.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Without modifiers, these keys rotate by the angle step (the default is 15 degrees,<a href="c06.xhtml#section6.3">6.3</a>). With Alt, they rotate so that the perspective lines are 
moved by (at most) 1 screen pixel at the current zoom.</p>
			<p>Shift-X, Shift-Y, and Shift-Z toggle the corresponding 
vanishing points from finite to infinite and back.</p>
			<p><a id="208"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_208" title="208"/>For example, you can make all three vanishing points infinite and rotate them to the
angles of 150 (X), 90 (Y), and 30 (Z) degrees for drawing isometric boxes without any
perspective foreshortening. Also, while boxes look most natural when they are located
somewhere in between the three vanishing points, they are not obliged to be there;
moving a box away from the sweet spot of a "natural" perspective makes it look curiously
distorted—which, sometimes, may be exactly what you want.</p>
			<a id="section11.3.3.1"/><h4>11.3.3.1 Merging and Unmerging Perspectives</h4>
			<p>
				For a newly created 3D box, Inkscape reuses the perspective of the <em>last
selected</em> 3D box. As a result, boxes in your drawing will normally <em>share</em> the same
perspective. When you change a perspective, <em>all</em> boxes using
this perspective—whether selected or not—respond to the
change, as shown in <a href="#fig11-12">Figure 11-12</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig11-12"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="12/sha-3dvpchange.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 11-12: Changing a perspective by dragging a
vanishing point affects all the boxes in this perspective.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				If several boxes share a perspective, you can <em>unmerge</em> any one of them by
dragging its finite vanishing point (with only that box selected) with
Shift. Unlike dragging without Shift, this change affects only the selected
box. Once unmerged, any change of the box's perspective (by dragging with or without Shift or via the controls bar)
will affect only that box.</p>
			<p><a id="209"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_209" title="209"/>Also, when you move a 3D box object in the Selector tool, its own set of vanishing points moves along with the box,
effectively unmerging its perspective if it was shared. This means you should avoid manipulating 3D boxes
in the Selector tool if you want your 3D scene to keep a consistent perspective.</p>
			<p>
				It is just as easy to <em>merge</em> two different perspectives together so they become one.
To do this, select two boxes with different perspectives and move a finite vanishing point of one perspective to the
same-dimension (same-color) point of the other—they will snap and join (similar to how the gradient handles

The boxes will now have the same perspective. (If the perspectives had any infinite
vanishing points, their direction angles must be the same for perspective merging to
work.)</p>

			<h3>11.3.4 Handles</h3>
			<p>
				Each 3D box, when selected in any of the shape tools or the Node tool, displays eight
diamond-shaped <em>corner handles</em> and an X-shaped <em>center handle</em>. Without
modifiers, the four handles on the front X/Y side reshape that side, while the four
others change the Z depth of the box. With Shift, however, their roles are
reversed, as shown in <a href="#fig11-14">Figure 11-14</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig11-14"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="12/sha-3dh.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 11-14: Dragging a box's corner handles with and without
Shift</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				With Ctrl, the side-resizing handles snap to the continuations of that side's
edges and its diagonal. For depth-changing handles, Ctrl has no effect (<a href="#fig11-15">Figure 11-15</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig11-15"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="12/sha-3dhctrl.svg.png"/>

					<p>Figure 11-15: Dragging a box's corner handles with
Ctrl</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="210"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_210" title="210"/>You can make any of the dimensions of the box negative by dragging a handle up to and beyond the other handle on the corresponding axis.
This inverses the order of the sides (that is, the far side on that axis becomes the near side and vice versa).
This is not recommended, though, because such an inside-out box does not always render its sides in the correct z-order.</p>
			<p>
				Dragging the central handle without modifiers moves the box in the X/Y
plane; with Ctrl, it snaps it to the directions of its X and Y vanishing
points as well as the bisector between them. With Shift (with or without
Ctrl), the central handle moves the box toward its Z vanishing point, as shown in <a href="#fig11-16">Figure 11-16</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig11-16"/><figure>

					<p>Figure 11-16: Dragging a box's center handle with and

			<p>
				As with rectangles, if you enable snapping of nodes to paths, nodes, and
intersections (<a href="c07.xhtml#section7.3.1.2">7.3.1.2</a>), your 3D scene will feel very snappy—everything you draw or
resize will be eager to join and line up, making it a pleasure to build solid gapless
constructions out of boxes. As a simple example, to build a multi-story building,
draw a single-story box, then duplicate it by Ctrl-D and
Ctrl-drag the central handle of the copy upward to raise it to the next
level until it snaps into place, as <a href="#fig11-17">Figure 11-17</a> demonstrates.</p>
			<a id="fig11-17"/><figure>

			<h3>
				11.3.5 <a id="211"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_211" title="211"/>Styling</h3>
			<p>From the viewpoint of styling, a 3D box is no different from a group of paths. By
default, all six sides of a new box have different shades of blue; you can paint the
entire box with some color (removing any difference between the sides), or you can
Ctrl-click and Ctrl-Alt-click to select any single side to
paint it separately.</p>
			<p>
				You can even <em>enter</em> the box just as you would enter a group (<a href="c05.xhtml#section5.10">5.10</a>)
by selecting it and pressing Ctrl-Enter. After that, you can select single sides by simple clicking or using Tab and Shift-Tab.
No matter how you style its sides, the box remains a box, so its styling is preserved in any 3D transformations. To remove the 3D box functionality, you
need to ungroup it (Ctrl-U) or convert it to paths (Shift-Ctrl-C, which actually converts it to a <em>group</em> of paths).</p>
			<p>
				Apart from changing fill or stroke paint, you can apply blur (<a href="c17.xhtml#section17.1">17.1</a>), clips, and masks (<a href="c18.xhtml#section18.3">18.3</a>) to an
entire box or to any of its sides individually. If you lower the opacity of a 3D box, it
works at the group level (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.8.2">4.8.2</a>)—that is, you can see what's beneath the box,
but you cannot see the hidden sides of the box itself. To be able to see the hidden
sides, lower the opacity of individual sides by selecting them separately, as shown in <a href="#fig11-18">Figure 11-18</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig11-18"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="12/sha-3dopacity.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 11-18: Opacity on the whole box vs. on individual sides</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The <em>z-order</em> of sides within a box is automatically correct from the 3D
viewpoint—that is, the sides that are supposed to be farther away from you are at the
bottom, and the front sides are at the top of the z-order. However, the z-order <a id="212"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_212" title="212"/>of
different boxes is not enforced by Inkscape in any way; like any other shape tool, the 3D
Box tool creates a new box on top of the current layer's z-order (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.4">4.4</a>). Therefore,
after drawing a box, you may need to move it in the z-order stack relative to other boxes
for the composition to look correct.</p>
			<p>
				For newly created boxes, the tool offers the same choice between the last set style and the tool's own
style (<a href="#section11.1.2">11.1.2</a>)—but with a twist. By default, the 3D Box tool uses the
last set style, but unlike all other tools, it remembers the style last set on <em>the same side of a 3D box</em>, not on any
object. For example, if you paint the top side of any box red,
the top sides (but not the other sides) of all new boxes you create afterward will be red.</p>
			<p>Since a 3D scene typically assumes a single light source, this behavior
makes sense. Draw a single box and paint its sides as they would look when lit from, for
example, the top-left corner. After that, all new boxes you create will be "lit" in a similar way.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>
						This tool remembers the last set style only when you assign
it to <em>individual sides</em>, not the entire box. For example, if you just select a box
and paint it all red, new boxes will <em>not</em> honor this. If you want all
new boxes to have stroke but no fill ("wireframe"), the easiest way to achieve this is
to enter a box as a group <span class="rm">(Ctrl-Enter)</span>, select all its sides<span class="rm">(Ctrl-A)</span>, and assign the stroke and remove the fill on all of them at
once.</p>

			<p>
				The Tweak tool works on 3D boxes exactly as you would expect it to work on
a bunch of paths (grouped or not). With path tweaking modes (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.6">12.6</a>), once you distort
the sides of a box, it ceases to be a 3D box and becomes a simple group. The Color Paint
and Color Jitter modes, however, paint over boxes without destroying their 3D
capability. It may make sense to enable only the hue and possibly saturation channels
but not lightness (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.9.3">8.9.3</a>), so that you can tweak the colors of boxes but preserve the
relative lightness and darkness of their sides for the 3D effect, as shown in <a id="figref11"/><a href="c15b.xhtml#ill-fig11">Figure 11 in the color insert</a>.</p>
			<a id="section11.4"/><h2>11.4 Ellipses</h2>
			<p>
				An ellipse is a shape that can represent not only an <em>ellipse</em> or a <em>circle</em> but also an<em>arc</em> (a fragment of an ellipse or circle with a chord) or a <em>segment</em> (an arc plus two radii going from the ends of the arc
and meeting in the center), as shown in <a href="#fig11-19">Figure 11-19</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig11-19"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="12/sha-ellhandles.svg.png"/>

					<p>Figure 11-19: Handles on an ellipse, arc, and segment</p>

			<a id="section11.4.1"/>
			<h3>
				11.4.1 <a id="213"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_213" title="213"/>Drawing</h3>
			<p>To switch to the Ellipse tool, press E or F5. Here are the
ellipse drawing shortcuts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Dragging on the canvas creates an ellipse inscribed into the (imaginary)
rectangle that your drag creates.</li>
				<li>With Ctrl, that imaginary rectangle is first
restrained to a square or an integer ratio (1:2, 2:1, and so on), and then the ellipse is
inscribed into it.</li>
				<li>
					With Shift, drawing starts from the center, so <em>one quarter</em> of
an ellipse is inscribed into this rectangle instead of the whole ellipse. With both
Ctrl and Shift pressed, you get a circle or an integer-ratio ellipse starting
from the center (<a href="#fig11-20">Figure 11-20</a>).<a id="fig11-20"/><figure>
						<img alt="" src="12/sha-elldraw.svg.png"/>
						<figcaption>
							<p>Figure 11-20: Drawing ellipses without Alt</p>
						</figcaption>
					</figure>
					</li>
				<li>
					With Alt, the behavior of the tool changes (see <a href="#fig11-21">Figure 11-21</a>). Now it draws an
ellipse whose <em>diagonal</em> goes from the start to the end points of your mouse drag.
In other words, you start your drag in the 10:30 clock position on the ellipse and
end at the 4:30 point, and the ellipse is squeezed as needed to fit this diagonal.<a id="fig11-21"/><figure>
						<img alt="" src="12/sha-elldraw1.svg.png"/>
						<figcaption>
							<p>Figure 11-21: Drawing ellipses with Alt</p>
						</figcaption>
					</figure>
					</li>
				<li><a id="214"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_214" title="214"/>With Ctrl-Alt, the tool always draws a perfect circle, with its
diameter stretching from the drag start to drag end. This is convenient if you need a
circle with a given diameter.</li>
				<li>
					Adding Shift to Alt and Ctrl-Alt works the same
as without Shift but begins drawing from the center—in other words, it
creates a circle with a given <em>radius</em>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				One way to create circles of a fixed size quickly is by Ctrl-clicking
in the Pen tool in the Straight lines or Paraxial mode (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.1.4">14.1.4</a>). You can set the size of these circles on the <span class="ui">Preferences</span>
page for the Pen tool. Add Shift to make them twice that size, or 
Alt to randomize their sizes, as shown in <a href="#fig11-21">Figure 11-21</a>.</p>
			<a id="section11.4.2"/><h3>11.4.2 Handles</h3>
			<p>
				Upon creation, an ellipse displays four handles: two square ones (top and left), a round
one (right), and an X-shaped one (center). Just as with rectangles, the square handles are the sizing handles, and the round
handle is in fact two handles sitting on top of one another. In ellipses, however, they're
not for rounding but for turning an ellipse into an arc or segment, as you'll see shortly.
The X-shaped handle moves the entire ellipse and is used for center snapping (<a href="c07.xhtml#section7.3.1.3">7.3.1.3</a>).</p>
			<p>
				As with rectangles, the sizing handles of an ellipse change the ellipse's width and
height <em>in the ellipse's own coordinates</em> instead of the document coordinates. No
matter how you rotate or skew your ellipse, these handles remember the position of both
axes of the ellipse and let you stretch or squeeze the ellipse with respect to those
intrinsic axes, always preserving the position of the center, as shown in <a href="#fig11-22">Figure 11-22</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig11-22"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="12/sha-ellsizing.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 11-22: Transforming ellipses in the Selector and by the
sizing handles</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Here are the shortcuts of the ellipse sizing handles:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Drag with Ctrl to turn an ellipse into a circle by making the
other radius the same.</li>
				<li>Ctrl-click a handle to turn an ellipse into a circle without dragging. Note that the circle may still appear elliptic if skewing was applied to it.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Now let's look at the arc/segment handles—the round ones. To make a segment (an arc
plus two radii), drag one or both of these handles <em>outside</em> the ellipse; to make
an <em>arc</em>, drag while remaining <em>inside</em> it. Of course, the handle itself 
remains neither inside nor outside but exactly on the edge of an ellipse; the <a id="215"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_215" title="215"/>phrase "drag
inside" refers to where your mouse goes while you have that handle grabbed. Note that
the sizing handles still work and remain in the same positions as for a whole ellipse
(which may be outside your arc or segment).</p>
			<p>
				The controls bar of the Ellipse tool lets you specify the exact angles of an arc,
turn it into a segment, and make the ellipse whole (<a href="#fig11-23">Figure 11-23</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig11-23"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="12/sha-ellarc.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 11-23: Segments and arcs</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Note that unlike segments (which are always closed), arcs can be either <em>closed</em> or <em>unclosed</em>. An unclosed arc has the stroke going
along the ellipse's edge but does not connect the ends of the arc (you can make this obvious if
you remove the fill, leaving only the stroke). Use one of the two arc buttons on the controls bar to switch
an arc between closed and unclosed.</p>
			<p>Here are the arc/segment handle shortcuts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					With Ctrl pressed, snap the handle to angle increments (15 degrees by
default, <a href="c06.xhtml#section6.3">6.3</a>) when dragging.</li>
				<li>Shift-click a handle to turn an arc or segment into a whole 
ellipse.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Like all other shape parameters, start and end angles of an
ellipse are remembered and reused for newly created shapes. It may be a
surprise when you intend to draw an ellipse and get a narrow pie slice
instead because you've recently turned some other ellipse into a segment.</p>
			<a id="section11.5"/><h2>11.5 Stars and Polygons</h2>
			<p>
				The Star tool (the * key or Shift-F9) creates two slightly
different kinds of rotationally symmetric shapes: polygons and stars (<a href="#fig11-24">Figure 11-24</a>).
Despite the simplicity of the idea, this is one of the most entertaining tools in
Inkscape—perfect for wowing your friends!</p>
			<a id="fig11-24"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="12/sha-startypes.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 11-24: A polygon and a star</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				A <em>polygon</em> is formed by a number of equidistant points lying on an imaginary
circle and connected by segments. An Inkscape polygon has one diamond-shaped handle
used to scale and rotate it, as well as control the shape of the connecting segments.</p>
			<p>
				A <em>star</em> is a more interesting shape. It has two sets of equidistant
points on two imaginary concentric circles, with the outline of the star zig-zagging back and
forth between points on the inner and outer circles. Using a star's two <a id="216"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_216" title="216"/>handles, you can
vary the diameters of the circles and rotate the circles relative to one another around their common center,
which produces a fascinating variety of symmetric shapes.</p>
			<a id="section11.5.1"/><h3>11.5.1 Drawing</h3>
			<p>Before you draw a new shape, decide whether you want a polygon or a star by
pressing one of the toggle buttons on the controls bar, and choose the number of corners
(convex vertices) in the numeric control. For example, a polygon with three corners is an
equilateral triangle that will have three nodes if converted to path; a star with three
corners, however, will have six nodes. You can always change the polygon/star type and the
number of corners in an existing shape, too—just select it and edit the values.</p>
			<p>
				The minimum <span class="ui">Corners</span> value is 2 for stars and 3 for polygons. A three-cornered polygon is, of course, a triangle, whereas a two-cornered star  creates rhombuses or parallelograms.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>
						The maximum value for <span class="ui">Corners</span> is 1,000, but if you set it too high, it may
slow down Inkscape unless you use the Outline mode (<a href="c03.xhtml#section3.14">3.14</a>).</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>Drawing a shape is, again, as simple as dragging your mouse upon the
canvas. A star or polygon is always drawn starting from its center. There's only one
keyboard shortcut: dragging with Ctrl snaps the angle of one of the shape's
corners relative to its center to 15-degree increments.</p>
			<a id="section11.5.2"/><h3>11.5.2 Handles</h3>
			<p>Dragging a polygon's diamond-shaped handle scales and rotates the polygon—something 
you can do just as well by transforming it in the Selector. The two handles of a star are more interesting.</p>
			<p>
				First, by moving one of them closer or farther from the center of the star, you are changing the
ratio of the diameters of the two circles on which the corners of the star lie. This
ratio is called the <em>spoke ratio</em> and is also adjustable as a numeric parameter
(disabled for polygons) in the controls bar (<a href="#fig11-25">Figure 11-25</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig11-25"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="12/sha-starspoke.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 11-25: Adjusting the spoke ratio of a
5-vertex star</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>You can even move the original inner handle farther away from the center
than the outer one. The control will still show a ratio less than 1 because it
always divides the smaller radius by the larger, regardless of which of them was
initially inner or outer.</p>
			<p><a id="217"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_217" title="217"/>Then, the inner handle (initially on the inner circle) can be moved<em>tangentially</em>—along an arc around the star center—to skew the star's vertices, as shown in <a href="#fig11-26">Figure 11-26</a>.
(Rotating the outer handle simply rotates the entire star.)</p>
			<a id="fig11-26"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="12/sha-startangent.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 11-26: Moving the inner handle of a star
tangentially</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Drag the inner handle with Ctrl if you want to keep the vertices strictly
radial (no tangential displacement), or Ctrl-click it to remove any
existing tangential skew without dragging.</p>
			<a id="section11.5.3"/><h3>11.5.3 Rounding</h3>
			<p>
				You can create fascinating effects with a star or polygon by <em>rounding</em> it.
This is different from rounding the corners of a rectangle; with a star or polygon, not only do the
corners lose sharpness but the sides of the shape also bend into elegant Bézier
curves (<a href="#fig11-27">Figure 11-27</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig11-27"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="12/sha-starround.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 11-27: A rounded 4-sided polygon compared to a rounded
rectangle</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Note that a rounded square has straight line segments between circular
or elliptic rounded corners. However, a rounded polygon or star has no straight lines at
all—all of its segments become Bézier curves.</p>
			<p><a id="218"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_218" title="218"/>The <span class="ui">Rounded</span> numeric control of the Star tool is the ratio of the length of
each Bézier handle (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.1.4">12.1.4</a>) to the length of the polygon/star side that this handle
affects. This parameter can be negative, which reverses the direction of
tangents. Typically, values between 0.2 and 0.4 give the most natural-looking results.
Values that are negative or too high positive may result in twisting, looping, and
self-intersections. By varying this value, you can get an infinite variety of beautiful shapes, as shown in <a href="#fig11-28">Figure 11-28</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig11-28"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="12/sha-starroundfun.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 11-28: Fun with rounded stars</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Apart from the numeric rounding parameter on the controls bar, you can round
by Shift-dragging any of the handles
tangentially.
For positive rounding, rotate a handle counterclockwise around the star's center;
rotate clockwise for negative rounding. Shift-clicking a
handle removes any rounding.</p>
			<p>
				If you want the outer corners of a star to be sharp but the inner ones
smoothed, or vice versa, try creating an offset path (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.4">12.4</a>) from the star.</p>
			<a id="section11.5.4"/><h3>11.5.4 Randomizing</h3>
			<p>
				Yet another way to make a star interesting is by <em>randomizing</em> it. Randomization
moves all vertices of a star or polygon in random directions by
random distances. If the star was rounded, randomization preserves the smoothness of all
vertices.</p>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Randomized</span> parameter in
the controls bar
controls the overall force of the effect. It can take positive and negative values. As you change this value—or 
simply Alt-drag a star's handle tangentially—the direction of random
displacement for each node remains the same, and only the distance changes; a negative
value simply moves the vertex in the opposite direction. In other words, the star
remains randomized in the same way but to a varying extent.</p>
			<p>
				By contrast, when you simply drag a randomized star's handle to scale or reshape
it, or when you draw a new star with nonzero randomization, the shape trembles and
jitters, abruptly changing the random displacements for all nodes (in mathematical
terms, <em>reseeding</em> the randomization) with the slightest move of your mouse. So, if
you want your star to become randomized differently but with the same overall amplitude,
simply drag any of its handles slightly, as shown in <a href="#fig11-29">Figure 11-29</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig11-29"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="12/sha-starrand.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 11-29: Randomizing stars</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				What are randomized stars good for? Randomness is a fundamental principle
of nature, and randomness in design is a great way to make things look less rigid and more natural. 
Your artistic sense will tell you where and how much randomness
is appropriate. Inkscape offers many sources of artistic randomness: you can
shuffle the positions of objects (<a href="c07.xhtml#section7.5.2">7.5.2</a>), create patterns with random placement,
scaling, and rotation (<a href="c16.xhtml#section16.6">16.6</a>), as well as randomly displace nodes in paths <a id="219"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_219" title="219"/>to distort
them (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.6.6">12.6.6</a>). Still, randomized stars are unique in how easy it is to create a
shape whose intrinsic symmetry emphasizes its randomness.</p>
			<p>
				Slight randomization makes a star more lively—sometimes outright funny. Strong
randomization produces a variety of wild and unpredictable shapes—messy hairballs, rounded
amoeba-like ink blotches, fantastic landscapes at the edge of a large star with many vertices and spoke ratio close to 1.
As an example, <a href="#fig11-30">Figure 11-30</a> shows a star with 500 vertices, not randomized (left) and
randomized by just 0.005 (right) to look more naturally hairy and to get rid of the moiré pattern.</p>

				As another example, here is a random but unclumped (<a href="c07.xhtml#section7.5.2">7.5.2</a>) scattering of pentagons, rounded at 0.28 and
randomized at 0.15, looking very much like pebbles on a beach, as <a href="#fig11-31">Figure 11-31</a> demonstrates.</p>

				11.6 <a id="220"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_220" title="220"/>Spirals</h2>
			<p>
				The Spiral tool (the I key or F9) creates another simple
but versatile shape: a <em>concentric spiral</em>.
Both as a drawing aid and as a shape in its own right, a spiral may be very useful—and no less exciting than a star.</p>

				A spiral, like a star, is drawn from the center. Dragging with Ctrl, as
usual, snaps the drag point (the outer end of the spiral) to 15-degree increments (<a href="c06.xhtml#section6.3">6.3</a>). 
Unlike all other shape tools, the Spiral tool by default creates new spirals with its own style—no fill,
black 1 px stroke—instead of the last used style (<a href="#section11.1.2">11.1.2</a>).</p>
			<p>Once drawn, a spiral displays two handles on both ends of the line. Simply dragging
these handles circularly rolls the spiral in or out—from the inside or from the
outside. In this way, you can, for example, create a spiral with only one turn.</p>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Turns</span> parameter on the controls bar indicates how many full circles your spiral
makes from the center to the outer end.
The maximum number of spiral turns is 1000. The <span class="ui">Inner radius</span> value controls the inner end; it gives the
percentage of the total turns where the spiral starts (<a href="#fig11-32">Figure 11-32</a>). For example, an <span class="ui">Inner
radius</span> of 0 means that the spiral starts right in the center; 0.5 means that it
starts half-way between the center and the outer end.</p>

				The <span class="ui">Divergence</span> of a spiral controls whether a spiral's
winding is equispaced throughout (divergence = 1), becomes denser toward its center (divergence &gt; 1),
or becomes denser toward the periphery (divergence &lt; 1). You can change this parameter
either numerically via the controls bar or by Alt-dragging the inner handle up or down, as shown in <a href="#fig11-33">Figure 11-33</a>.</p>

			<p><a id="221"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_221" title="221"/>Here are the other shortcuts for the outer handle:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Shift-drag to scale or rotate around the center (no rolling on unrolling); this is the
same behavior as when drawing the spiral.</li>
				<li>Alt-drag to lock the radius while rolling or unrolling. This way, the entire
spiral becomes denser or sparser without changing its overall size.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Inner handle shortcuts include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Alt-drag vertically to adjust divergence.</li>
				<li>Alt-click to reset divergence to the default of 1.</li>
				<li>Shift-click to reset the inner radius to 0 (that is, move the inner handle
all the way to the center).</li>
			</ul>

				When does it make sense to use spirals? A spiral fills a given space with a uniform
concentric pattern—something that may not be easy to achieve manually or using any
other tools. It may therefore serve as a drawing guide or carrier for other objects, such as
markers (<a href="c09.xhtml#section9.5.1">9.5.1</a>), dash patterns (<a href="c09.xhtml#section9.4">9.4</a>), 
text on path (<a href="c15.xhtml#section15.2.4">15.2.4</a>), or live path effects (<a href="c13.xhtml#ch13">Chapter 13</a>). Also, like
the Ellipse tool, the Spiral tool can be convenient for creating curves with smoothly
varying curvature; unlike with a plain Bézier curve, you can make an arc or a spiral shorter
or longer by dragging a handle <em>along</em> the curve without affecting its shape.</p>

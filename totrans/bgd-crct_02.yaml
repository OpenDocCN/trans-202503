- en: You might have grown up playing a game called *Operation*, in which you play
    a surgeon who uses tweezers to remove silly ailments (like brain freeze and charlie
    horse) from a patient. If you aren’t careful and touch the wrong place, a terrifying
    buzzer sounds and the patient’s nose lights up.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, you’ll build a steady-hand game that works a lot like *Operation*,
    but the goal is to move a ring along a track of steel wire without letting them
    touch. If you get the ring all the way to the other side without touching the
    wire, you win. If the ring touches the wire, the buzzer sounds and you lose.

- en: The circuit works on the basic principle that for anything to happen in electronics,
    there must be a *closed loop*—a continuous path from the positive to the negative
    side of the battery where the current can flow. When the metal ring doesn’t touch
    the steel wire, you don’t have a closed loop, so nothing happens. When the ring
    touches the steel wire, you get a closed loop and the buzzer sounds.

    the battery, in the black part of the circuit diagram, to the breadboard. Make
    sure you place the plus sign (+) on the buzzer toward the positive terminal of
    the battery. Remember, the red lead of the battery clip connects to the positive
    terminal on the battery.

    one from the negative battery terminal (the two yellow wires in [Figure 1-1](ch01.xhtml#ch01fig1)).

- en: To create the game track, use a steel wire from a clothes hanger and bend it
    into the shape you want. Connect the steel wire to the breadboard using the loose
    jumper wire from the negative connection of the battery and some tape, as in [Figure
    1-2](ch01.xhtml#ch01fig2). Make sure the metal at the end of the jumper wire is
    touching the steel wire so there’s a good electrical connection between them.

    the buzzer to the end of an old pen, making sure the jumper wire has a good connection
    with the metal (see [Figure 1-4](ch01.xhtml#ch01fig4)). The pen offers players
    something to easily grasp as they navigate the turns in the track.

    can modify the game so it uses an LED instead of a buzzer. Just replace the buzzer
    in the circuit with an LED. Don’t forget to put the LED in series with a resistor
    (just like your first breadboard circuit); otherwise, you risk breaking the LED.

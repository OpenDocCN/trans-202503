    Notation. “Parallel algorithms divide up work and do that work in parallel—at
    the same time, that is. For example, the work might be distributed over different
    people. In this case, we can divide the leads into three sets. Then you, Frank,
    and I can each take a set of leads. We can investigate different leads at the

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: “好的，”Notation同意道。“我们如何分配工作？”
- en: Frank knew the key to an efficient parallel algorithm was making sure that the
    benefit of using multiple workers was worth the cost of dividing up the work.
    Parallelizing work involves a certain amount of overhead. The problem needs to
    be broken into pieces. Each worker has to get a task, get ready to do it, and
    then actually do it. And then at the end, the work has to be recombined. Parallelizing
    a simple task can sometimes be more costly than just solving it outright. However,
    when the problem gets large enough, parallelization can greatly accelerate an
    algorithm.

  zh: Frank知道，高效并行算法的关键是确保使用多个工作者的好处值得分工的成本。并行化工作涉及一定的开销。问题需要被分解成多个部分。每个工作者都必须获得任务、准备好执行它，然后真正去做。最后，工作需要重新合并。并行化一个简单的任务有时比直接解决它还要更为昂贵。然而，当问题变得足够复杂时，使用并行化可以极大地加速算法的执行。
- en: “Easy,” said Frank. “Socks, I need you to talk to your wizard friends. Ask them
    if they know about a group called the League of something. The thugs on the boat
    said they were working for a league before Rebecca Vinettee interrupted them.
    Judging by previous cases, the name will be something evil like the League of
    Power-Hungry Maniacs or the League of Darkness. Evil leagues tend not to be subtle
    with their names. Find out everything you can about this group.”

  zh: “很简单，”Frank说。“Socks，我需要你去找你的巫师朋友们。问问他们是否知道有一个叫做‘某某联盟’的团体。船上的那些暴徒说他们以前为一个联盟工作，直到Rebecca

    Notation, she was the only one who could get the records easily. If he tried to
    collect them himself, he would be met with suspicious looks and a small barricade
    of paperwork. The capital police department used paperwork with the same determination
    and effectiveness as roadblocks.

    into independent units and then recombine it. Some problems are trivial to parallelize.
    For example, if you are searching a large stack of scrolls for a particular clue,
    you can easily divide the work by giving each worker a subset of the scrolls.

  zh: 高效并行算法的关键是将工作有效地划分成独立的单元，然后再进行合并。有些问题非常容易并行化。例如，如果你在查找一堆卷轴中的某个线索，可以很容易地将工作划分给每个工人一部分卷轴。

    Even if you have 100 officers, you can’t question a suspect any faster. It’s an
    inherently serial problem. You need to base your next question on the suspect’s
    previous answers. And, perhaps more importantly, a suspect can answer only one
    question at a time. I’ve seen eight officers shouting questions at the same time.
    The interrogation doesn’t go any faster.

  zh: 然而，其他算法则要难得多，甚至不可能并行化。即使你有 100 个警察，你也无法更快地审问嫌疑人。这是一个固有的串行问题。你需要根据嫌疑人之前的回答来提问。而且，也许更重要的是，嫌疑人每次只能回答一个问题。我曾经看到过
    8 个警察同时大声问问题，审讯并没有因此变得更快。
- en: Another aspect to consider when parallelizing algorithms is whether the efficiency
    is even worth the overhead. A parallel algorithm requires additional setup time
    to divide the work, as well as completion time to merge the results back together.
    Individual tasks have to be assigned to different workers, often requiring some
    amount of communication. Consider the task of searching an unsorted array with
    only three values. By the time the setup is complete, a single person could have
    likely scanned through the array many times over.

  zh: 另一个在并行化算法时需要考虑的方面是，效率是否值得付出额外的开销。并行算法需要额外的设置时间来划分工作，并且还需要时间来合并结果。每个任务必须分配给不同的工作者，这通常需要一定的沟通。考虑一下在一个仅包含三个值的未排序数组中进行搜索的任务。在设置完成之前，一个人可能已经能多次扫描整个数组。

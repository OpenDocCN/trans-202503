    her as he tried to catch his breath. Was she concerned? Confused?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “We were attacked!” Socks blurted out. “We were trapped in a cell and everything
    was on fire! But I used a metal weakening spell so we could escape.” He looked
    quite pleased with himself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Attacked?” asked Notation. “Who attacked you? Did you see them? What did they
    look like?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Frank shook his head. “All I saw was Socks flying at me.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I bet he was big,” offered Socks. “A giant thug. And he was stealthy. Maybe
    a trained assassin.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Frank rolled his eyes. “Sorry, kid. He was an amateur. Professional assassins
    don’t lock people in cells and run away.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Your staff started the fire,” Frank reminded him. “You dropped it on the papers.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Papers?” asked Notation. “Did you find the logs? Do you know what they were
    after?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Frank and Socks looked at each other. Notation glanced from one to the other.
    Finally, Frank spoke, “The logs are gone. Our junior wizard here dropped his staff
    and *poof*—fire everywhere. Any clues are gone now.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Yeah,” said Frank. He nodded toward the smoke trickling from the door.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “What about the person who attacked you?” asked Notation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I didn’t get a look at him,” said Frank. “I don’t suppose *you* saw anything?”
    he asked. The question came out sharper than he’d intended, but after being attacked,
    getting trapped in a burning room, and fleeing a darkened prison, he didn’t feel
    like pulling any punches.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “No,” she said calmly. “There was nothing around the front.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “No tracks near any of the doors?” asked Frank. “Anything that could give us
    a clue about our attacker?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Notation shook her head. “Nothing,” she said. “It looked as though no one had
    been around the other side in months.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Frank nodded, but didn’t speak. Something felt wrong. Either the attacker had
    cleverly slipped by Notation through the same gate they had used, or she wasn’t
    telling them something. How long had she been away from the gate? And why had
    she stayed outside? Frank decided not to press the issue. “All right. Let’s head
    back to the boat.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Now what?” asked Socks as they made their way toward the water.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Time to backtrack,” said Frank. “No more clues here.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Backtrack to where?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “The open clues,” Frank answered. “We investigate the leads we still have left.”
    He paused for a moment, weighing his options. “I think it’s time we parallelize
    the search.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Really?” asked Notation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Parallelize?” asked Socks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “It means we split up and explore different parts of the search space,” answered
    Notation. “Parallel algorithms divide up work and do that work in parallel—at
    the same time, that is. For example, the work might be distributed over different
    people. In this case, we can divide the leads into three sets. Then you, Frank,
    and I can each take a set of leads. We can investigate different leads at the
    same time, allowing us to work almost three times faster.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “But,” objected Socks, “I’m not an officer or a private investigator. I don’t
    know what to do. Shouldn’t I stay with one of you?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “No,” said Frank. “I’m still not sure what’s going on, but I have a feeling
    we’re working with limited time. Whoever we’re after knows we’re on the case now
    and knows we’ve tracked them this far. If they’re smart, they’ll start destroying
    the rest of the evidence.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “It’ll be late by the time we get back to Usb,” noted Socks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “We can split up tonight and meet at my office tomorrow morning,” said Frank.
    “That should give us enough time to follow leads and possibly grab some sleep.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Okay,” agreed Notation. “How do we divide up the work?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Frank knew the key to an efficient parallel algorithm was making sure that the
    benefit of using multiple workers was worth the cost of dividing up the work.
    Parallelizing work involves a certain amount of overhead. The problem needs to
    be broken into pieces. Each worker has to get a task, get ready to do it, and
    then actually do it. And then at the end, the work has to be recombined. Parallelizing
    a simple task can sometimes be more costly than just solving it outright. However,
    when the problem gets large enough, parallelization can greatly accelerate an
    algorithm.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Easy,” said Frank. “Socks, I need you to talk to your wizard friends. Ask them
    if they know about a group called the League of something. The thugs on the boat
    said they were working for a league before Rebecca Vinettee interrupted them.
    Judging by previous cases, the name will be something evil like the League of
    Power-Hungry Maniacs or the League of Darkness. Evil leagues tend not to be subtle
    with their names. Find out everything you can about this group.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “That’s not much to go on,” Socks complained.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Notation,” continued Frank. “I need you to pull all police transfer records
    for the last six months.” While he didn’t like the idea of leaving this lead to
    Notation, she was the only one who could get the records easily. If he tried to
    collect them himself, he would be met with suspicious looks and a small barricade
    of paperwork. The capital police department used paperwork with the same determination
    and effectiveness as roadblocks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Transfers?” asked Notation, clearly surprised. “Why?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Call it a hunch,” Frank lied. “We’ll meet at my office tomorrow morning and
    combine our information.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    She obviously knew Frank wasn’t telling her the whole story.
  prefs: []

- en: As the *TCP Flyer* slowly cruised back to Usb, Frank found an out-of-the-way
    corner on the deck and sat down to think. This was the part of the investigation
    he hated most, when promising leads started drying up or, in this case, burning
    up. The loss of a crucial clue always filled Frank with a sense of dread—like
    he was running one step behind. Frank forced the doubts from his mind and refocused
    on the clues he did have. The voyage to Usb would give him time to comb through
    what he had seen and find connections he had missed.

    all, the boy had saved his life.

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “But do you think we’ll be in time?” asked Socks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alarm bells went off in Frank’s head. He swiveled and stared hard at Socks.
    “Time for what?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Socks nearly fell backward. His eyes darted around, as though searching for
    an appropriate answer. “Whatever they’re planning?” he finally stammered.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Frank didn’t buy it. “What else do you know?” he asked.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Nothing,” replied Socks. “At least, nothing concrete. It’s just speculation.
    Not mine—my mentor Gretchen’s. She has good insight into these types of things,
    though.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    days.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Unless it is a complete guess, she must have some reason,” said Frank. “Is
    it a guess?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    are most effective during the full moon, which is in two days.”

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Socks hesitated for a moment. “It’s an incredibly powerful artifact,” he started.
    Upon seeing the angry look in Frank’s eyes, he sped up. “It’s officially called
    the Mask of Combinatorial Looks. It was lost hundreds of years ago during the
    Great Slug War. Everyone thought it was destroyed until Princess Ann recovered
    it during one of her quests. She found it—”

    uses a massively parallel search. Each feature runs its own search to find the
    best match. The nose will transform into a perfect match of the target’s nose.

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    without any real conviction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    hard proof . . .” He trailed off, looking miserable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    that’s it.”
  prefs: []

    The wind had died down within the last hour, and the *TCP Flyer* seemed to be
    barely inching toward their destination.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: He ran the timeline of the next few days through his head and wondered if they
    had enough time. Even with three of them searching in parallel, there was no guarantee
    they would cover enough ground. Worse, they couldn’t even begin the parallel search
    until the *TCP Flyer* docked. Until then, they were all stuck on the boat.

- en: 'A parallel algorithm breaks up a problem into multiple pieces, performs the
    computation on those pieces at (approximately) the same time, and then combines
    the results when all pieces are finished. It divides up the work among different
    workers, allowing them to complete the task faster than a single worker could.
    Consider our favorite example: searching an abandoned building for a suspect.
    The more officers you have, the more rooms you can check at the same time and
    the faster you can find the suspect. If you have 30 rooms and 30 officers, they
    can kick in all the doors at once.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key to an efficient parallel algorithm is to efficiently divide the work
    into independent units and then recombine it. Some problems are trivial to parallelize.
    For example, if you are searching a large stack of scrolls for a particular clue,
    you can easily divide the work by giving each worker a subset of the scrolls.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, other algorithms are much more difficult or even impossible to parallelize.
    Even if you have 100 officers, you can’t question a suspect any faster. It’s an
    inherently serial problem. You need to base your next question on the suspect’s
    previous answers. And, perhaps more importantly, a suspect can answer only one
    question at a time. I’ve seen eight officers shouting questions at the same time.
    The interrogation doesn’t go any faster.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another aspect to consider when parallelizing algorithms is whether the efficiency
    is even worth the overhead. A parallel algorithm requires additional setup time
    to divide the work, as well as completion time to merge the results back together.
    Individual tasks have to be assigned to different workers, often requiring some
    amount of communication. Consider the task of searching an unsorted array with
    only three values. By the time the setup is complete, a single person could have
    likely scanned through the array many times over.

- en: Inkscape's 3D Box tool ([11.3.1](c11.xhtml#section11.3.1)) is not intended as
    a replacement for specialized 3D design applications. Inkscape is a drawing program,
    and its 3D Box tool is best used as a *drawing aid*, which is how we’ll use it
    in this simple tutorial.

- en: A *3D-correct* drawing is one that satisfies the rules of perspective that have
    been known to artists for centuries. It does not need to have perfectly realistic
    shading and texturing; it just needs the lines and shapes to be approximately
    correct with regard to angles and dimensions.

- en: Intentional perspective distortions may well have an artistic value of their
    own, and some drawing styles don’t use perspective at all. When necessary, many
    artists are capable of drawing 3D-correct art without any technical aid. However,
    quite often you will notice perspective errors—from barely noticeable to embarrassing—in
    otherwise well-done pieces of art. I would love to see more artists—not only beginners—use
    Inkscape's quick and easy way to set up the perspective for a drawing without
    tedious measurements and helper lines.

    Box tool (X) and drag in the middle of the canvas to draw the box for the room.
    To see all sides of the box at once, enter it as a group (Ctrl-Enter), select
    all sides inside (Ctrl-A), and set the **Opacity** slider in the status bar (marked
    O:) to 50 percent, as shown in [Figure 22-1](#fig22-1). Then, leave the group
    (Ctrl-Backspace).

    box’s handles and, if necessary, the vanishing points to adjust what you've drawn.
    Use the corner handles to resize your room. The four X/Y handles move in the X/Y
    plane by default and along the Z axis when you press Shift. The four Z handles,
    conversely, move along the Z axis without Shift and in the X/Y plane with Shift.
    The X-shaped central handle will move the entire room, again in the X/Y plane
    without Shift and along the Z axis with Shift. When moving a handle in X/Y, press
    Ctrl to restrict its movement to one of the axes (only X or only Y). Dragging
    the vanishing points will reslant and resize the entire room to fit the changed
    perspective ([11.3.3](c11.xhtml#section11.3.3)).

- en: You can create a third vanishing point on the Y axis in addition to those in
    X and Z. In other words, you can make the Y vanishing point *finite*. Do this
    if you want your drawing to have a more dramatic or exaggerated perspective—as
    if viewed by a spider in the corner of the room. Conversely, you can make the
    X and/or Y vanishing points infinite if you want a more detached, "scientific"
    view from far away, as shown in [Figure 22-2](#fig22-2).

    in z-order, the boxes can be in any order so long as their sides are semitransparent
    and you can see the edges of all boxes you created.) The new box will use the
    same perspective (the same vanishing points) as the room box. Grab the lower-left
    X/Y handle and drag it so it snaps to the lower-left Z-edge of the room. That
    will be the base of the sofa; use the other corner handles to give it the correct
    height, width, and depth ([Figure 22-3](#fig22-3)).

    flattened in the X dimension will make perfect windows. However, how do you place
    them properly, given that no side of a window aligns with a side of any other
    box?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Again, the duplicate-then-resize trick is the easiest way to achieve this. Duplicate
    the largest box you have—the room itself. Ctrl-drag its front X/Y handle backward
    (along the X axis) to squeeze it into a thin layer; then, drag four handles on
    the X/Y plane to resize the window into place. For a second window, duplicate
    the first one and Shift-drag its central handle in the Z direction; this way,
    the second window will be an exact perspective-aligned copy of the first one.
    Using the same duplicate-and-flatten trick, add a doorway box on the Z-most wall
    (that is, the wall closest to the Z vanishing point), so that it protrudes outside
    of the room box, as [Figure 22-5](#fig22-5) demonstrates.

    How can the 3D Box tool help with drawing humans? I'm not going to model robot-like
    constructions out of parallelepipeds, but I still want the height and bulkiness
    of each figure to be correct in the drawing's perspective, and an easy way to
    ensure this is with the 3D Box tool.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here’s how you do it. First, add a tall, narrow box in the doorway. This will
    be human 1\. As before, duplicate the doorway box, squeeze it on the sides in
    the X/Y plane, and resize it for a realistic proportion of the figure height and
    doorway height. (Ask someone to stand in a real doorway to get an idea.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then, duplicate the human 1 box. Using its X-shaped handle in the middle of
    this new human, Shift-drag it to the front, then Ctrl-drag it horizontally a bit
    along the X axis. This will be the second human standing beside the sofa ([Figure 22-6](#fig22-6)).

    serve as useful guides for actually drawing the human figures. If I were trying
    to achieve even better anatomic fidelity, I could use a stack of three boxes for
    the legs, body, and head for each human. (Unfortunately, you cannot drag several
    selected boxes in 3D space *at once*; you have to drag them one by one.)

    such as the sofa and humans, this is hardly possible, but even the walls and windows
    will benefit from some hand-drawn roughness and imperfections. Use the edges of
    the 3D boxes as general guides, but otherwise, *draw freely* (Inkscape's motto)
    in your own manner and style ([Figure 22-7](#fig22-7)). You certainly don't need
    to trace *all* of the lines; you can omit some and hint at others with short partial
    strokes.

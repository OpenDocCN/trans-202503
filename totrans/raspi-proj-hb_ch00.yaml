    for about $35\. It has everything a normal computer has: a processor; RAM; ports
    to plug in a monitor, mouse, and keyboard; and the ability to connect to the internet.
    The Raspberry Pi board even has one special feature that normal computers don’t:
    General Purpose Input Output Pins (GPIOs). These GPIOs let the Pi interact with
    the real world, allowing you to build smart electronics projects and control them
    with the Pi.'

    so it has some limitations. First, it can’t keep up with the demands of some modern
    software, so not all software will work with the Pi. Second, it runs the Linux
    operating system instead of Windows or macOS, which may be more familiar to you.

    but with some limitations? The Pi gives you freedom to experiment in ways you
    wouldn’t or couldn’t with your computer. Computers are expensive and much harder
    to fix, so you wouldn’t want to tinker too much without knowing exactly what you’re
    doing. However, as Linus Torvalds—the founder of Linux—said in an interview with
    BBC News, Raspberry Pi makes it possible to “afford failure.” You can play around
    with hardware and software on the Pi without worrying about breaking something
    expensive or losing all your important files!

    write a script is in the *Python Editor*, which is like a word processor for writing
    code. In the editor, you can create, edit, and save Python files. You then execute
    these scripts by running the file. Python files have *.py* extension.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Notice something very important here. Some lines begin with a few spaces before
    the code—four spaces to be exact. This is called *indentation*. Indentation is
    important to define *code blocks*. For example, you have an `if` statement at
    ➊, and the following line is indented at ➋. The indentation tells Python that
    the line at ➋ belongs to the preceding `if` statement, so that line will only
    be executed if the `if` condition is true. The line at ➌ is not indented, which
    means that line doesn’t belong to the same code block and will run separately.
    Indentation is essential in Python so the interpreter knows what code to run when,
    so pay attention to the spacing as you work through this book.

    it proceeds to the next one, and so on. When a condition is true, it runs the
    corresponding indented code, and the statement ends. Note that there is no limit
    on the number of `elif` statements in a program. It’s also not necessary to include
    an `else` clause, but if there is one, it must come at the end.

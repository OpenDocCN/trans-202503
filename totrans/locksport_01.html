<h2 class="h2parta">THE BASICS</h2>
<p class="noindent">Welcome to the world of locksport! We’re excited to have you join the global family of people who see locks as a puzzle to be solved. It is our sincere hope that you find our hobby as entertaining as we do, and that one day you might join us at a local meetup or even an international competition!</p>
<p class="indent">This section will provide you with a strong foundation on which to build your lock-opening skills. We’ll start with a look at where locksport began, as well as current groups you can join and the locksport rules and local laws you should be aware of as you get started. From there, we’ll cover what makes a lock click, components of locks that make them harder or easier to pick, and finally, how to disassemble, reassemble, and care for the locks in your collection. It’s going to be a fun ride; let’s get going!<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_2"/></p>

    required: a device with data and wireless capabilities, plus standard applications
    like a browser, email, maps, and messaging applications. These features weren’t

    devices did exist. But apps weren’t really the reason why people bought their
    phones, and they didn’t dominate users’ time on their devices. Instead, the phones
    came with built-in applications that handled most of their needs: they could talk
    on the phone, check email, message, and maybe browse the web (in a limited way).'

    so much more than device companies could provide in their own apps. So while the
    Google-provided Gmail, Maps, browser, and messaging apps were all very important
    on the early Android system, it was even more important for Android to open the
    door to *external* developers. Android allowed developers to write and provide
    their own applications, helping to create a rich ecosystem for users to be able
    to do much more than they ever could with just the apps that Google provided.

    were either building a platform themselves, licensing one for a significant cost,
    or cobbling something together from existing, but incomplete, solutions. Android
    provided a powerful, free, and open option for manufacturers that desperately
    needed it.

    the shared vision was important in establishing the future that they were all

    ecosystem was compatibility of implementations, ensuring that developers could
    write apps that worked everywhere, instead of having to rewrite them for the plethora
    of available devices. To solve this problem, the Android team provided the Compatibility
    Test Suite (CTS) for manufacturers to ensure that they are providing a compatible
    implementation on every new device.

    in order to establish the momentum that Android needed to succeed. The Android
    team worked closely with partners to get the platform working well on new devices,
    building up a pipeline of devices for the market, establishing a large market
    of Android phones from manufacturers across the world.

    factor in its growth. For one thing, Google had deep pockets, which made funding
    easier, including purchasing technology when it made more sense than building
    it from scratch. But Android’s achievements were due to more than just having
    access to Google’s money and resources. After all, many other large and successful
    companies did not fare as well with their mobile efforts during the same time
    period.

    separate from the rest of the company gave the team that startup dynamic that
    they felt Android needed in those early days to ship the first product. At the
    same time, being a part of Google gave Android more leverage with partner companies
    than it would have had as an actual startup company.

    that Android needed as it grew. Not only did the services team have the right
    experience to connect the Google apps to backend servers, but the team also had
    the advantage of relying on an infrastructure that could scale to their needs.
    A company that could handle the extreme download requirements of YouTube was able
    to deal with OTA updates for the small but growing base of Android users.

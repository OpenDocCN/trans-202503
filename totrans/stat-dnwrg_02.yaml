    or control groups randomly, rather than for any systematic reason. Though the
    word *random* makes such studies sound slightly unscientific, a medical trial
    is not usually considered definitive unless it is a randomized controlled trial.
    Why? What’s so important about randomization?

    test groups. Otherwise, they might assign frail patients to a less risky or less
    demanding treatment or assign wealthier patients to the new treatment because
    their insurance companies will pay for it. But randomization has no hidden biases,
    and it guarantees that each group has roughly the same demographics; any confounding
    factors—even ones you don’t know about—can’t affect your results. When you obtain
    a statistically significant result, you know that the only possible cause is your
    medication or intervention.

    so I recruit 2,000 patients and randomly split them into two groups. Then I administer
    the medications. After waiting a month for the medication to take effect, I measure
    each patient’s blood pressure and compare the groups to find which has the lower
    average blood pressure. I can do an ordinary hypothesis test and get an ordinary
    *p* value; with my sample size of 1,000 patients per group, I will have good statistical
    power to detect differences between the medications.

    group, I recruit only 10, but I measure each patient’s blood pressure 100 times
    over the course of a few months. This way I can get a more accurate fix on their
    individual blood pressures, which may vary from day to day. Or perhaps I’m worried
    that my sphygmomanometers are not perfectly calibrated, so I measure with a different
    one each day.^([[8](#ftn.ch03fn01a)]) I still have 1,000 data points per group
    but only 10 unique patients. I can perform the same hypothesis tests with the
    same statistical power since I seem to have the same sample size.

    For instance, after testing cells from a culture, a biologist might “replicate”
    his results by testing more cells from the same culture. Or a neuroscientist might
    test multiple neurons from the same animal, claiming to have a large sample size
    of hundreds of neurons from just two rats. A marine biologist might experiment
    on fish kept in aquariums, forgetting that fish sharing a single aquarium are

    question. Animal behaviorists frequently try to understand bird calls, for example,
    by playing different calls to birds and evaluating their reactions. Bird calls
    can vary between geographical regions, just like human accents, and these dialects
    can be compared. Prior to the 1990s, a common procedure for these experiments
    was to record one representative bird song from each dialect and then play these
    songs to 10 or 20 birds and record their reactions.^([3](apa.html#ch03en3)) The
    more birds that were observed, the larger the sample size.

    songs. No matter how “representative” any given song may have been, playing it
    to more birds couldn’t provide evidence that Dialect A was more attractive to
    male yellow-bellied sapsuckers than Dialect B was; it was only evidence for *that
    specific song or recording*. A proper answer to the research question would have
    required many samples of songs from both dialects.

    same subject over time (*autocorrelation*), like in my blood pressure experiment.
    Blood pressure measurements of the same patient from day to day are autocorrelated,
    as are revenue figures for a corporation from year to year. The mathematical structure
    of these autocorrelations can be complicated and vary from patient to patient
    or from business to business. The unwitting scientist who treats this data as
    though each measurement is independent of the others will obtain pseudoreplicated—and
    hence misleading—results.

    agricultural field experiment might compare growth rates of different strains
    of a crop in each field. But if soil or irrigation quality varies from field to
    field, you won’t be able to separate variations due to crop variety from variations
    in soil conditions, no matter how many plants you measure in each field. A better
    design would be to divide each field into small blocks and randomly assign a crop
    variety to each block. With a large enough selection of blocks, soil variations
    can’t systematically benefit one crop more than the others.

    can help account for pseudoreplication. Statistical techniques do not magically
    eliminate dependence between measurements or allow you to obtain good results
    with poor experimental design. They merely provide ways to quantify dependence
    so you can correctly interpret your data. (This means they usually give wider
    confidence intervals and larger *p* values than the naive analysis.) Here are

    bind to different proteins or genes; fluorescent dyes allow a scanner to detect
    the quantity of material bound to each probe. Cancer research in particular has

    dyes. In a large study, different microarrays may be processed by different laboratories
    using different equipment. A naive experimental setup might be to collect a dozen

    then run all the cancerous samples through the processing machine on Tuesday and
    the healthy samples on Wednesday.

    laboratory temperature can affect chemical reactions, and different bottles of

    largest source of variation in an experiment’s data is simply what day the microarrays
    were processed. Worse, these problems do not affect the entire microarray in the
    same way—in fact, correlations between the activity of pairs of genes can entirely
    *reverse* when processed in a different batch.^([8](apa.html#ch03en8)) As a result,
    additional samples don’t necessarily add data points to a biological experiment.

    systematic error introduced by the equipment—not anything about cancerous cells

    biological groups are being tested, you can split each group evenly between batches
    so systematic differences do not affect the groups in different ways. Also, be
    sure to record how each batch was processed, how each sample was stored, and what
    chemical reagents were used during processing; make this information available
    to the statisticians analyzing the data so they use it to detect problems.

    data to determine whether different batches gave wildly different results. Principal
    components analysis determines which combinations of variables in the data account
    for the most variation in the results. If it indicates that the batch number is
    highly influential, the data can be analyzed taking batch number into account
    as a confounding variable.

    gap of 28 days between periods and the other a gap of roughly 30 days. Their cycles
    will diverge *consistently* over the course of the study, starting two days apart,
    then four days, and so on, with only a bit of random variation because periods
    are not perfectly timed. Similarly, two women can start the study *not* aligned

    If the average cycle lasts 28 days, then two average women can have periods which

    it’s only eight days before her next period.) That’s the maximum, so the average

    frequently overlap even as cycles converge and diverge over time.

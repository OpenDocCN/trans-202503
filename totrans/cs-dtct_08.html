<p class="noindent">The Port of Mudwall didn’t even live up to its unimpressive name. It wasn’t much of a port; the rickety wooden dock could fit no more than two modestly sized ships. The mudwall itself, in theory a 20-foot-tall earthen city wall, had never actually been constructed, and was only hinted at here and there with 2-foot-tall humps surrounding about a third of the city.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank stepped over the dirt hump and made his way to the sole shop in the city, with Notation and Socks trailing along behind him.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As they entered the store, the shopkeeper’s face transformed from surprise to outright delight with the progression of a powerful sneeze. He knocked a stack of carrot-themed tourist pamphlets off the counter as he hurried around to greet them.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Hello!” he nearly shouted. “Welcome to Mudwall, home of the famous mud carrot farms. What can I get for you? Food? Supplies? Carrots? Carrot-flavored baked goods? We have a simply wonderful carrot pie.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Information,” said Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The shopkeeper’s face dropped. “Oh,” he said. “You’re not here for the Carrot Festival, then?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_66"/>“Carrot Festival?” asked Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The shopkeeper nodded. “It’s the 50th annual Carrot Festival later this week.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“You get a lot of visitors for that?” she asked.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Not recently,” admitted the shopkeeper. “Mudwall isn’t the tourist draw that it used to be. Not since G’Raph started hosting its Mud Radish Festival. People would rather go there for the big-city atmosphere.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notation and Socks looked at each other. Socks mouthed, “What’s a mud radish?” Notation shrugged.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“What do you know about a ship that came through here a few days ago?” Frank asked.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“What ship?” asked the shopkeeper. “We haven’t had a ship here in a few months. We’ve had a few donkey carts pass through on the coastal road. But no ships.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Are you sure?” asked Notation. “Because we are on an official investigation, and it is very important that you tell us anything you might know about all ships that have come through here recently.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I would have known if there was a ship,” said the shopkeeper. “I have a wonderful view of the dock from my window. Even if I hadn’t seen it, I would have heard about it. We don’t get many ships these days. People would’ve been all excited. The Sound of Carrots, our three-person marching band, usually greets each ship. I certainly would have heard them.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notation looked as though she was preparing for a new round of questions, but Frank cut in first. “Thank you, sir,” he said. “We appreciate your time.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">He herded Notation and Socks from the building and back into the muddy street.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Do you think he was telling the truth?” asked Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank nodded, scanning the street. “He seemed genuinely surprised at the mention of a ship,” he said. “But it wouldn’t hurt to ask around a bit more.”</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_67"/><img src="../images/f0067-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">They interviewed a dozen of the town’s residents, a sample that made up approximately half the population, before admitting defeat. No one had seen a ship. No one had heard of anyone seeing a ship. And no one could even understand why a ship would visit. The port clearly didn’t receive much traffic.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Maybe it came at night,” mused Notation as they walked the dock toward the <em>TCP Flyer</em>. “They sent a small party ashore on a rowboat, handed off the documents, and left. Someone could have been waiting with a cart right here.” She pointed to an arbitrary plank on the dock, which didn’t look any more or less suspicious than its neighbors.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Maybe,” said Frank. “It doesn’t matter, though. Without a witness, there’s no trail.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“What does that mean? We can’t find them? The investigation is over?” asked Socks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank grunted a laugh. “No, kid. Dead ends are part of investigation work. That’s why we use a backtracking search.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Socks stared blankly back at Frank. When comprehension failed to dawn on the boy’s face, Frank added, “We keep exploring along the most promising direction until that trail hits a dead end. Then we backtrack to a previously unexplored, but promising, lead and search from there.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_68"/>“So you have other leads?” asked Socks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“A few,” admitted Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“If we backtrack to the next unexplored clue,” Notation mused, “we return to the logbook. There was another destination listed: Frayed Cable Island.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank nodded and considered which leads remained. The senior thug had mentioned a League of something. That meant Frank’s pitiful list of unexplored leads currently consisted of:</p>&#13;
<div class="blockquote">&#13;
<p class="noindent">Frayed Cable Island</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Threads from the ArrayCart</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Vinettees</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">League?</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">The search would now backtrack to the logbook and the unexplored island. If they failed to pick up a trail on Frayed Cable Island, he would be forced to follow one of their more tenuous leads. The colored threads from the cart were unique enough to be moderately promising.</p>&#13;
<p class="center">_____________________</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“So we aren’t done yet?” Socks confirmed for the tenth time as the <em>TCP Flyer</em> traveled to Frayed Cable Island. “You still have a few leads, right?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Investigations backtrack all the time,” Notation assured him yet again. “Don’t you ever have to backtrack in your work? What about while making a potion?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Socks looked shocked. “How would you backtrack while mixing a potion? You can’t unadd spider legs or unstir the mixture.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I meant backtrack while <em>developing</em> a potion. You try adding spider legs and realize that it destroys the magical consistency or something? So you cross out that instruction and try a different approach the next time you mix the potion. Each recipe you try is a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_69"/>single state in your search space, and you backtrack by returning to the last good recipe.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Oh,” said Socks. “You mean <em>revising</em>. You have to revise spells and potions as you develop them. You’re still moving toward your goal, just not in a straight line. Nobody gets it right the first time.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Exactly. It’s the same thing,” said Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Mavis joined the group, adding, “It’s like when you’re searching a cave for a ‘forgotten’ stash of goods, you explore down different paths and backtrack when you don’t see anything of value.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Yes,” Notation agreed, hestitantly. “Backtracking search is much like exploring caves. Although I have to point out that it would be difficult to tell if an object found was forgotten or not. I guess you could—”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“And speaking of searches, we’re at your next destination,” interrupted Mavis. “Frayed Cable Island doesn’t have any docks. We’ll anchor the <em>TCP Flyer</em> here, but you lot will have to row in the rest of the way.”</p>&#13;

<p class="sidebart"><strong>POLICE ALGORITHMS 101: BACKTRACKING</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="sbsub"><em><strong>Excerpt from Professor Drecker’s Lecture</strong></em></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Almost every investigation will involve some backtracking. Even the best officers can’t always follow clues in a straight path from start to finish. The world is filled with useless information, ambigious clues, and red herrings. On top of that, you’ll make mistakes. So it’s important to know how to backtrack a search when you hit a dead end. Simply put, this means backing up your search to a previous state and trying a different option.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_70"/>Up until this point, algorithms have been presented on search spaces where they can efficiently jump from any state to any other arbitrary state. For example, in an array, you can easily examine the value at any location using just its index. And in a hotel hallway, you can run between rooms. This flexibility provides efficiency for the algorithms.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">However, many search spaces come with constraints on how you can move from state to state. If you are searching a castle in the physical world, you can’t jump arbitrarily between rooms—you have to traverse the halls and rooms in between. Similar constraints can apply in the computational realm for data structures like graphs or linked lists.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Even in cases where you can jump between states, it is often useful to picture backtracking as moving through previous states on your way to explore new states. In the algorithmic world, this can be significantly less costly than physically retracing your route. However, the processes are conceptually similar: you back up the search and proceed down a different avenue.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the following lectures, we’ll see many examples of searches that backtrack when they hit dead ends. And once you join the force, you’ll experience more dead ends than you ever imagined.</p>&#13;

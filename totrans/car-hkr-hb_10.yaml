- en: The latest trend in vehicle technology is *vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication*—or
    in the case of vehicles communicating with roadside devices, *vehicle-to-infrastructure
    (V2I) communication*. V2V communication is primarily designed to communicate safety
    and traffic warnings to vehicles through a dynamic mesh network between vehicles
    and roadside devices called the *intelligent transportation system*. This mesh
    connects various nodes—vehicles or devices—in the network and relays information
    between them.

    be included in all new light vehicles, though as of this writing nothing has been
    finalized.

    design stage, rather than after the fact. The details of V2V implementation and
    interoperation between countries are still being determined, so many processes
    and security measures are still undecided. Nevertheless, in this chapter, we’ll
    review the current design considerations in an attempt to offer guidelines for
    what to expect. We’ll detail the thinking behind different approaches and discuss
    the types of technologies likely to be deployed in the V2V space. We’ll also discuss
    several protocols used in V2V communications and the types of data they’ll transmit,
    and we’ll review V2V’s security considerations as well as areas for security researchers
    to focus on.

    networks already have a security system in place, so communication can rely on
    security methods provided by the cellular carriers. The security provided by cellular
    networks is at the wireless level (GSM), not the protocol level. If the connected
    device is using IP traffic, then standard IP security, such as an encryption and
    reduction of attack surfaces, still needs to be applied.

    security measures can be implemented prior to widespread adoption. DSRC is also
    more reliable than cellular communication, with lower latency. (See “[The DSRC

    power used by a DSRC device will dictate its range. Roadside equipment can transmit
    at higher-power ranges, allowing up to a 1,000 m specification, while vehicles
    can broadcast only at a power level that provides closer to 300 m ranges.

    systems, such as wireless access for vehicle environments (WAVE), use IEEE 1609.3
    specification or the WAVE short-message protocol (WSMP). These messages are single
    packets with no more than 1,500 bytes and typically less than 500 bytes. (Network
    sniffers such as Wireshark can decode WAVE packets, which allows for easy sniffing
    of traffic.)

    the same time. A single user on the system would typically see data rates of 6
    to 12Mbps, while users in a high-traffic area—say, an eight-lane freeway—would
    likely see 100 to 500Kbps. A typical DSRC system can handle almost 100 users in
    high-traffic conditions, but if the vehicles are traveling around 60 km/h, or
    37 mph, it’ll usually support around only 32 users. (These data rates are estimated
    from the Department of Transportation’s paper “Communications Data Delivery System
    Analysis for Connected Vehicles.”^([1](footnote.html#fn01)))

    between countries. For example, the US system is designed to support seven channels
    with one channel that acts as a dedicated control channel reserved for sending
    short high-priority management packets. The European design supports three channels
    with no dedicated control channel. This disparity is largely due to the fact that
    each country has different drivers for the technology: Europe’s system is market
    driven, while the US system has a strong vehicle safety initiative behind it.
    Therefore, while the protocols will interoperate, the types of messages supported
    and sent will differ significantly. (In Japan, DSRC is currently being used for
    toll collection, but the Japanese are also planning to use a 760 MHz band for
    crash avoidance. The Japanese 5.8 GHz channels don’t use 802.11p, but they should
    still support the 1609.2 V2V security framework.)'

    WAVE management entity (WME) and also handles channel assignments and monitors
    service announcements. (The WME is unique to WAVE and handles the overhead and
    maintenance of the protocol.) Control channels are used for service announcements

    radio (SDR), they could receive information about vehicles within the receiver’s
    range—such as the size, location, speed, direction, and historical path up to
    the last 300 m—and use this information to track a target vehicle. For example,
    if an attacker knew the make and model of a target vehicle and the size of the
    target, they could set up a receiver near the target’s home to remotely detect
    when the target moves out of range of the DSRC receiver. This would tell the attacker
    when the owner had left their house. This method would allow an attacker to continue
    to track and identify vehicle activity despite the owner’s attempts to obscure

    we do know that the security for cellular, DSRC, and hybrid communications is
    based on a public key infrastructure (PKI) model much like the SSL model on websites.
    By generating public and private key pairs, PKI systems allow users to create
    digital signatures for use in encrypting and decrypting documents sent over networks.
    Public keys can be openly exchanged and are used to encrypt data between destinations.
    Once encrypted, only private keys can be used to decrypt the data. The data is
    signed with the sender’s private key in order to verify its origin.

    a certificate from one of these CAs and use it on a web server, other browsers
    will verify this certificate against the CA to ensure it’s trusted. In a normal

    they’re compromised by an attacker or lost by their owner or because a device

    update its CRL so that it can determine which certificates, if any, are no longer
    trustworthy.
  id: totrans-224

    through DSRC or opportunistic Wi-Fi. Therefore, most systems will implement an
    incremental update period, which the manufacturer decides, but even that can cause
    issues. DSRC requires roadside devices to send the list, but in order to receive
    large chunks of data, the vehicle must travel past the roadside devices slowly
    enough that they have enough time to receive the CRL. Because most devices will
    be situated on major highways, with only a few on side roads, the only opportunity
    a vehicle might have to receive an updated list is during a traffic jam. The best
    way to retrieve an updated CRL is, therefore, through cellular or full-satellite
    communication, though that’s still slow. With high-speed cellular or full-satellite
    links, it would be possible to receive incremental updates or full downloads if
    required.

    could receive a CRL download only from nearby cars traveling in the same direction
    long enough to complete the download; cars going in opposite directions may pass
    by too quickly. This V2V method also provides the opportunity for a bad actor
    to inject a bad CRL that could either block legitimate devices or hide bad actors,
    and that bad CRL could then circulate through traffic like a virus.

    The onboard system, such as the ECU, is responsible for requesting and storing

    system provides an easy gateway for attackers to inject their code. Instead of
    taking over the device performing the actual V2V communication, they could simply
    modify the ECU firmware or spoof packets on the bus, and the V2V device would
    then faithfully sign and send the information out to the network. It’s because
    of this latter vulnerability that this method has been unofficially dubbed the

    packet? The answer differs for each automotive industry, but the general concept
    is that the ECU—or some other device—would receive a packet and check whether
    it “makes sense.” For example, the receiving device might validate a message against
    a GPS signal or identify reports of a vehicle traveling at improbable speeds,
    say 500 mph. When something erroneous is detected, the vehicle should send a misbehavior
    report, which would eventually lead to revocation of that certificate. A misbehavior

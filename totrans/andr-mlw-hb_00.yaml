- en: Android is the world’s most popular operating system, touching the lives of
    nearly half its population. But its scale and capabilities regularly attract criminals,
    fraudsters, and scammers looking to steal money from users or otherwise illicitly
    profit.

- en: This book’s authors have been working in the field of Android security since
    2011, shortly after the first malware sample was found on the platform. Three
    of us—Sebastian, Salvador, and Sai—developed defenses against Android malware
    as part of Google’s Android Security team. Separately, V.S. and his researchers,
    including Qian and Yanhai, created some of the first robust machine learning methods
    for characterizing the behavior of Android malware.

    fraud, and many other kinds of harmful applications. We’ve also seen malware developers
    become more sophisticated, producing interesting families of malicious apps that
    have been documented by security researchers all over the world.

- en: After observing and combating these digital threats for more than a decade,
    we decided it was time to record what we knew about the Android malware we’d seen
    in the past, the methods of analyzing the malware of the present, and the use
    of machine learning to detect malware that may appear in the future. To date,
    this book is the most comprehensive overview of Android malware trends. Its aim
    is to help readers develop the analysis and detection skills that are so vital
    in today’s cybersecurity landscape.

- en: As you begin to study the vast array of malware categories in the Android ecosystem,
    you’ll soon realize how dynamic they are and how complex malware detection can
    be. Most security books don’t touch on machine learning techniques, but over the
    last few years machine learning algorithms have proven effective at accelerating
    the identification and classification of malware apps, allowing defenders to respond
    more quickly to that complexity and at a larger scale. Developing expertise in
    this type of AI-powered automation is a natural next step in the evolution of
    a malware analyst’s skill set.

<div class="imagec"><img alt="image" src="graphics/common01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">If mathematics bores or scares you, that’s okay. You’ll soon realize how easy Small Basic makes it for you to write programs that do math for you. Many programs use only simple operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For these types of problems, you need just the four basic math operators (<code>+</code>, <code>–</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>/</code>). The asterisk (<code>*</code>) represents multiplication, and the slash (<code>/</code>) represents division.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Other programs need to use some of the math functions that you might have learned in algebra (like square root, absolute value, and trigonometric functions). Small Basic’s <code>Math</code> object provides these functions and many others.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you don’t know what a square root or a trigonometric function is, don’t panic; you still can write programs using these functions. And it’s okay to skip some of the examples in this chapter, too.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_84"/>To use any of the <code>Math</code> object methods, you’ll write a statement like this:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">ans <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="blue1">Math</span><span class="brown">.SquareRoot(</span><span class="red">16</span><span class="brown">)</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In this example, you call the <code>SquareRoot()</code> method and pass 16 to it (to find the square root of 16). The output, or result of a method, is called the <em>return value</em>. In this statement, the method’s return value is assigned to the <code>ans</code> variable (short for <em>answer</em>). In this chapter, you’ll learn about the <code>Math</code> object’s methods and how to put them to work.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch07lev1sec01"><span class="blue"><strong>Exponent Methods</strong></span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The <code>Math</code> object has four methods related to exponents, but we’ll cover just <code>SquareRoot()</code> and <code>Power()</code> in this book.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec01"><em><strong>SquareRoot() and Good Old Pythagoras</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In this first example, we’ll find the length of the longest side, or <em>hypotenuse</em>, of a right triangle. If you call the lengths of the other two sides <code>s1</code> and <code>s2</code>, the Pythagorean Theorem tells you that the length of the hypotenuse is the square root of the sum of each side squared. Here’s the equation:</p>&#13;
<div class="image2"><img alt="image" src="graphics/f0084-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">We put this formula in the program in <a href="ch07.html#ch7ex1">Listing 7-1</a> so you don’t have to think about it too much. Given the two side lengths of a right triangle, the following program uses the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate the length of the hypotenuse.</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">1 <span class="green"><span class="codeitalic">' SquareRootDemo.sb</span></span><br/>2 <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.Write(</span><span class="red">"Enter the length of side 1: "</span><span class="brown">)</span><br/>3 s1 <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.ReadNumber()</span><br/>4<br/>5 <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.Write(</span><span class="red">"Enter the length of side 2: "</span><span class="brown">)</span><br/>6 s2 <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.ReadNumber()</span><br/>7<br/>8 hypot <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="blue1">Math</span><span class="brown">.SquareRoot(</span>s1 <span class="brown">*</span> s1 <span class="brown">+</span> s2 <span class="brown">*</span> s2<span class="brown">)</span><br/>9 <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.WriteLine(</span><span class="red">"Hypotenuse = "</span> <span class="brown">+</span> hypot<span class="brown">)</span></p>&#13;
<p class="listcap"><a id="ch7ex1"/><em>Listing 7-1: Finding the length of a hypotenuse</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This program prompts the user to enter the length of the first side (line 2) and then saves the input in <code>s1</code> (line 3). It then asks for the second input and saves it in <code>s2</code> (line 6). Then it computes the length of the hypotenuse (line 8) and displays the result (line 9). On line 8, notice how the square of <code>s1</code> (and <code>s2</code>) was computed by multiplying <code>s1</code> (and <code>s2</code>) by itself.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_85"/>Here’s a sample run of our program. Remember that this program works only with right triangles:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">Enter the length of side 1: <span class="codestrong">3</span><br/>Enter the length of side 2: <span class="codestrong">4</span><br/>Hypotenuse = 5</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec02"><em><strong>Powerful Powers</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You can use <code>Power()</code> for all sorts of calculations that involve exponents, like taking 3 to the 5th power. You might see this written in math class as 3<sup>5</sup>, which is the same as 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3. The 3 is called the <em>base</em>, and the 5 is the <em>exponent</em>. Here’s how you could perform this calculation in Small Basic:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">answer <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="blue1">Math</span><span class="brown">.Power(</span><span class="red">3</span><span class="brown">,</span> <span class="red">5</span><span class="brown">)</span><br/><span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.Write(</span>answer<span class="brown">)</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notice that <code>Power()</code> takes two arguments: the first is the base, and the second is the exponent. The result is saved in the <code>answer</code> variable. The second statement displays the output so you can check the answer.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now let’s look at a program that’s a little more complicated. We’ll use the <code>Power()</code> method to show you how money grows. If you deposit <em>P</em> dollars at a bank that gives an interest rate of <em>r</em> percent, then at the end of <em>n</em> years you’ll have <em>A</em> dollars:</p>&#13;
<p class="equ"><em>A</em> = <em>P</em> × (1 + <em>r</em>)<sup><em>n</em></sup></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Without worrying about where this formula came from, let’s write a program that computes the value of <em>A</em> for given values of <em>P</em>, <em>r</em>, and <em>n</em> (entered by the user). Enter the program in <a href="ch07.html#ch7ex2">Listing 7-2</a>.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_86"/>Run the program to see how much money you’ll have in 20 years if you deposit $1,000 with an interest rate of 6%:</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">We admit it’s rather strange to see dollars and cents written with so many decimal places. In this case, you don’t need all those digits to the right of the decimal point. Next, you’ll learn how to round this long answer to the nearest dollars and cents.</p>&#13;

They want to pay you $1 for balancing one cat on your head, $2 for balancing two cats on your head, $4 for balancing a third cat, and so on, doubling the money with each cat you add to the stack! Write a program to find out how much money you get when you have <em>n</em> number of cats balanced on your head, where <em>n</em> is entered by the user. Is it enough to retire and buy a cat mansion?</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch07lev1sec02"><span class="blue"><strong>Rounding Methods</strong></span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Sometimes you’ll need to round numbers in your programs. For example, if your program finds the average number of children per household in your neighborhood, you don’t want your program to display 2.25 (two and a quarter children per house). That wouldn’t make any sense!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The <code>Math</code> object gives you three methods that round or chop numbers: <code>Round()</code>, <code>Floor()</code>, and <code>Ceiling()</code>. See <a href="ch07.html#ch7fig1">Figure 7-1</a> for a quick overview of what each method does to a number.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><code>Round(x)</code> returns the whole number (or integer) nearest to <code>x</code>. <code>Floor(x)</code> returns the integer that’s less than or equal to <code>x</code>, and <code>Ceiling(x)</code> returns the integer that’s greater than or equal to <code>x</code>. Experiment with each of these different methods to see what results you get.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s use this rounding knowledge to fix the output of our interest calculator. Add the following statement after line 11 in <a href="ch07.html#ch7ex2">Listing 7-2</a>:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">A <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="blue1">Math</span><span class="brown">.Round(</span>A<span class="brown">)</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">After computing <code>A</code>, you round it and assign the rounded result back to <code>A</code>. When you run the program now with the same inputs, it will display $3207. Much better!</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_87"/><img alt="image" src="graphics/f07-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch7fig1"/><em>Figure 7-1: The rounding methods with example arguments and return values</em></p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec03"><em><strong>Traditional Rounding</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Be careful when you use the <code>Round()</code> method if the fraction part of the number is exactly 0.5. In this case, the <code>Round()</code> method rounds to the nearest even integer (this is called <em>banker’s rounding</em>). For example, 0.5 and –0.5 are rounded to 0, 1.5 and 2.5 are rounded to 2.0, and –1.5 and –2.5 are rounded to –2. This is different from what you learned in algebra, where the 0.5 fractions always round up to 1! Even though it’s not what you’re used to, banker’s rounding is very common and is regularly used by bankers, which gives it its name.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">But how can we make Small Basic round numbers the way you learned in school (where the 0.5 fraction is always rounded up)? We’ll do some fancy footwork using the <code>Floor()</code> method instead of the <code>Round()</code> method, like this:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="blue1">Math</span><span class="brown">.Floor(</span>x <span class="brown">+</span> <span class="red">0.5</span><span class="brown">)</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Using this trick, <code>x</code> represents whatever value you want to round. So if <code>x</code> is 0.6, then <code>x</code> + 0.5 = 1.1, and <code>Floor(1.1)</code> = 1. Cool! That’s exactly how we’d expect it to work.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">But let’s say <code>x</code> is 2.5. If we just used <code>Math.Round(2.5)</code>, we would get 2, which isn’t the result you would want if you wanted to use traditional rounding. We want to round up and get 3. Using our fancy trick, you’d get <code>x</code> + 0.5 = 3.0, and <code>Floor(3.0)</code> = 3. Now that’s more like it! This gets the values you’d expect if you wanted to round a number with a .5 fraction.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch07lev2sec04"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_88"/><em><strong>Rounding to the Nearest Hundredth</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Let’s explore <a href="ch07.html#ch7ex2">Listing 7-2</a> a bit more. Using <code>Round()</code> or <code>Floor()</code> on the answer gives you a whole number (dollars only). But what if you want to show the amount of money to the nearest penny? How can you make Small Basic round the answer to the nearest hundredth? Consider this statement:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="blue1">Math</span><span class="brown">.Floor(</span><span class="red">100</span> <span class="brown">*</span> x <span class="brown">+</span> <span class="red">0.5</span><span class="brown">) /</span> <span class="red">100</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For example, if <code>x = 2.8735</code>, then <code>100 * x + 0.5 = 287.85</code>, and the <code>Floor()</code> method returns 287. Dividing 287 by 100 is 2.87, which is the result we want.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can also round to the nearest hundredth using this statement:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="blue1">Math</span><span class="brown">.Round(</span>x <span class="brown">*</span> <span class="red">100</span><span class="brown">) /</span> <span class="red">100</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s use this second technique to round the answer from <a href="ch07.html#ch7ex2">Listing 7-2</a> to the nearest penny. Add the following statement after line 11 in <a href="ch07.html#ch7ex2">Listing 7-2</a>:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">A <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="blue1">Math</span><span class="brown">.Round(</span>A <span class="brown">*</span> <span class="red">100</span><span class="brown">) /</span> <span class="red">100</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">After computing <code>A</code> in line 11, the program rounds it to the nearest hundredth (nearest penny) and saves the rounded answer back in <code>A</code>. If you run the program now using the original inputs, the output will be $3207.14. Perfect! Now we’re talking money!</p>&#13;
<div class="sidebar">&#13;

<p class="noindent">Helen is having a tough time at her store. She uses a calculator to add the 6% sales tax to the purchase price. For example, if a customer’s total comes to $27.46, she multiplies 27.46 by 1.06 to get 29.1076. But should she charge the customer $29.10 or $29.11? She doesn’t have time to do these calculations herself! Her store keeps her much too busy!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Helen heard about your programming skills, so she’s coming to you for help. She needs a program that lets her enter the total purchase amount. Then she wants the program to add the sales tax, round the result to the nearest penny, and display the answer. Create this program for Helen.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch07lev1sec03"><span class="blue"><strong>Abs(), Min(), and Max() Methods</strong></span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The <code>Math</code> object provides methods for you to find the absolute value of a number. When you calculate the absolute value of a number, you’re finding its distance from zero, which will always be a positive number. For example, the absolute value of both –1 and 1 is 1.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_89"/>This code snippet shows you some examples:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="blue1">Math</span><span class="brown">.Abs(-</span><span class="red">2</span><span class="brown">)</span>         <span class="green"><span class="codeitalic">' = 2</span></span><br/><span class="blue1">Math</span><span class="brown">.Abs(-</span><span class="red">3.5</span><span class="brown">)</span>       <span class="green"><span class="codeitalic">' = 3.5</span></span><br/><span class="blue1">Math</span><span class="brown">.Abs(</span><span class="red">4</span><span class="brown">)</span>          <span class="green"><span class="codeitalic">' = 4</span></span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The <code>Abs()</code> method takes in a number (positive or negative) and returns that number’s distance from 0, or its absolute value. This return value is always a positive number. (In other words, <code>Abs()</code> removes the minus sign.)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For example, let’s say the user of your game needs to guess a secret number (10), but the guess doesn’t have to be exact. Instead, your game accepts any guess between 8 and 12. To check if the user’s guess is okay, you can test the absolute difference between the user’s guess (saved in the <code>guess</code> variable) and 10; that is <code>Abs(guess - 10)</code>. If the result is less than or equal to 2, then your player’s guess is good. You’ll learn how to perform checks like this one using <code>If</code> statements in the next chapter.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now let’s find the minimum or maximum of two numbers. The <code>Min()</code> method returns the lower of two numbers, and the <code>Max()</code> method returns the higher number:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="blue1">Math</span><span class="brown">.Min(</span><span class="red">5</span><span class="brown">,</span> <span class="red">10</span><span class="brown">)</span>      <span class="green"><span class="codeitalic">' = 5</span></span><br/><span class="blue1">Math</span><span class="brown">.Min(-</span><span class="red">3.5</span>, <span class="brown">-</span><span class="red">5.5</span><span class="brown">)</span> <span class="green"><span class="codeitalic">' = -5.5</span></span><br/><span class="blue1">Math</span><span class="brown">.Max(</span><span class="red">3</span><span class="brown">,</span> <span class="red">8</span><span class="brown">)</span>       <span class="green"><span class="codeitalic">' = 8</span></span><br/><span class="blue1">Math</span><span class="brown">.Max(-</span><span class="red">2.5</span>, <span class="brown">-</span><span class="red">4.7</span><span class="brown">)</span> <span class="green"><span class="codeitalic">' = -2.5</span></span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can use these methods to limit the numbers your user can input to your program. For example, if your program expects a number that’s less than 100, you can write this:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">ans <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.ReadNumber()</span><br/>ans <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="blue1">Math</span><span class="brown">.Min</span>(ans<span class="brown">,</span> <span class="red">100</span><span class="brown">)</span><br/><span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.WriteLine(</span>ans<span class="brown">)</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Try it out! Run this code two times. The first time, enter a number less than 100, and the second time, enter a number greater than 100. What happens? Can you modify the code so the entered number can’t go below 0?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">What if you want to find the minimum of three numbers? For example, let’s say you want to find the lowest score out of the three math quizzes you took last week. One way is to write this:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">minScore <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="blue1">Math</span><span class="brown">.Min(</span><span class="blue1">Math</span><span class="brown">.Min(</span>score1<span class="brown">,</span> score2<span class="brown">),</span> score3<span class="brown">)</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The inner <code>Min()</code> method finds the minimum of the <code>score1</code> and <code>score2</code> variables. That result and <code>score3</code> are passed to the outer <code>Min()</code> method to determine which is lower: the first minimum (of <code>score1</code> and <code>score2</code>) or <code>score3</code>. The final result is saved in the <code>minScore</code> variable.</p>&#13;

</div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch07lev1sec04"><span class="blue"><strong>The Remainder() Method</strong></span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You can get the remainder from any division operation by using the <code>Remainder()</code> method. For example, <code>Math.Remainder(10, 3)</code> returns 1 because 10 ÷ 3 = 3 with a remainder of 1.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can use the <code>Remainder()</code> method to test whether one integer (whole number) can be divided evenly by another, smaller integer. A remainder of 0 means that the larger number’s divisible by the smaller number (such as how 9 is divisible by 3). Knowing if there’s a remainder has all sorts of interesting uses. For example, if you want to check whether a number is even or odd, you can examine the remainder of that number divided by 2: if the remainder is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it’s odd.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To see the <code>Remainder()</code> method in action, let’s write a program that finds the number of dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies in a given amount of money. To find the most efficient quantity of dollars and coins, you’ll need to start with the largest denomination (dollars) and work your way down the the smallest one (pennies). <a href="ch07.html#ch7ex3">Listing 7-3</a> shows the complete program and includes example output in the comments. Read through the program, and see if you can figure out what happens when the input is 25.36.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_91"/>Let’s walk through this program line by line to understand how it works. The user enters 25.36 (that is, 25 dollars and 36 cents) in response to line 2, so the <code>total = 25.36</code>. Line 4 computes the total <code>cents</code> as <code>Floor(25.36 * 100) = 2536</code>. This number is then divided by 100 to get 25 and saved in <code>dollars</code> (line 5), with a remainder of 36, which is saved in <code>cents</code> (line 6). Next, 36 cents is divided by 25 to get 1 quarter (line 7) and a remainder of 11 cents (line 8). The remainder of 11 cents is then divided by 10 to get 1 dime (line 9) with a remainder of 1 cent (line 10). Lines 11 and 12 compute the available <code>nickels</code> and the remaining <code>pennies</code> in the same way. The rest of the program (lines 13–19) displays the results. <a href="ch07.html#ch7fig2">Figure 7-2</a> illustrates this program.</p>&#13;

<p class="programs">Enter an amount of money (such as 25.36): <span class="codestrong">23.78</span><br/>$23.78 = $23, 3Q, 0D, 0N, 3P.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">(Hint: if you divide 368 by 100, you get 3 with a remainder of 68. If you divide 68 by 10, you get 6 and a remainder of 8.)</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="ch07lev1sec05"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_92"/><span class="blue"><strong>Random Numbers</strong></span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Random numbers are used in many applications, like simulations and games. They’re also used for software testing (to see how a program responds to different input values) or to simulate random events (like the lottery).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The <code>GetRandomNumber()</code> method returns a random integer between one and the upper limit you pass to the method. Using this method, your program can generate random numbers that you can use in all sorts of exciting applications, for instance, to see whether a troll bops your hero on the head. Let’s look at some examples.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To simulate a roll of a die, write this:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">dice <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="blue1">Math</span><span class="brown">.GetRandomNumber(</span><span class="red">6</span><span class="brown">)</span><br/><span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.WriteLine(</span><span class="red">"You rolled: "</span> <span class="brown">+</span> dice<span class="brown">)</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The variable, <code>dice</code>, contains a number between 1 and 6 that’s selected at random, similar to picking it out of a hat (but not the Hogwart’s Sorting Hat). Run the program several times to see for yourself.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To simulate the flip of a coin, you can write this:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">coinFlip <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="blue1">Math</span><span class="brown">.GetRandomNumber(</span><span class="red">2</span><span class="brown">)</span><br/><span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.WriteLine(</span><span class="red">"Outcome: "</span> <span class="brown">+</span> coinFlip<span class="brown">)</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The variable <code>coinFlip</code> is either 1 or 2. The value 1 represents heads, and the value 2 represents tails (or the other way around; it’s up to you!).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To simulate rolling a pair of dice and finding their sum, you can write this code:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">num1 <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="blue1">Math</span><span class="brown">.GetRandomNumber(</span><span class="red">6</span><span class="brown">)</span><br/>num2 <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="blue1">Math</span><span class="brown">.GetRandomNumber(</span><span class="red">6</span><span class="brown">)</span><br/>outcome <span class="brown">=</span> num1 <span class="brown">+</span> num2<br/><span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.Write(</span><span class="red">"You got ("</span> <span class="brown">+</span> num1 <span class="brown">+</span> <span class="red">","</span> <span class="brown">+</span> num2 <span class="brown">+</span> <span class="red">"). "</span><span class="brown">)</span><br/><span class="blue1">TextWindow</span><span class="brown">.WriteLine(</span><span class="red">"The total is "</span> <span class="brown">+</span> outcome<span class="brown">)</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Although your outcome will be a number between 2 (rolling two 1s) and 12 (rolling two 6s), don’t make the mistake of writing this:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">outcome <span class="brown">=</span> <span class="red">1</span> <span class="brown">+</span> <span class="blue1">Math</span><span class="brown">.GetRandomNumber(</span><span class="red">11</span><span class="brown">)</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Although this statement gives you a number between 2 and 12, the probability you’d get from one random number is different from adding two random numbers together.</p>&#13;

We won’t explain what these are, but if you have no idea what a trigonometric function is or you’ve never even heard the word <em>trigonometry</em>, don’t worry. Just skip ahead to <a href="ch08.html#ch08">Chapter 8</a>. Otherwise, let’s jump right in with an example.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Imagine that androids from the future have traveled back to our time to destroy humanity, and you’re the only person who can stop their attack. You’ll need to use your cannon to destroy their weapons warehouse, as shown in <a href="ch07.html#ch7fig3">Figure 7-3</a>.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">Your cannon fires with an initial speed, <code>v</code>, of 160 feet per second. The warehouse is 500 feet away. All you have to do is figure out the launch angle θ (the Greek letter theta). The program in <a href="ch07.html#ch7ex4">Listing 7-4</a> prompts you to enter the desired angle, and then it computes the missile range <em>d</em> (in feet) according to the formula shown in the figure.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_94"/>After the prompt, the program reads your input and saves it in the variable <code>angle</code> (line 6). Then line 7 converts the angle from degrees to radians using the <code>GetRadians()</code> method (the <code>Sin()</code> method requires its input to be given in radians).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">After that, the program computes the distance using the given formula (line 9), rounds it to the nearest integer (line 10), and displays it (line 12).</p>&#13;

  zh: 本书的第四部分也是最后一部分，我们将结束一个许多其他生存主义出版物开始讨论的话题：主动保护自己、亲人和财产。
- en: 'The reason I decided to break ranks and save this matter for later is simple:
    despite what we pick up from 24-hour news and the grainy CCTV footage occasionally
    shared on YouTube or Facebook, active self-defense isn’t a common need. Events
    such as mass shootings or kidnappings are rare. As for everyday crime, as noted
    in Chapter 10, most burglaries happen when the occupants are away—and in such
    situations, a gun kept under the pillow isn’t of much use, except as an easy picking
    for whoever ransacks your home.'

  zh: 我决定暂时搁置这个话题，稍后再提，原因很简单：尽管我们从24小时新闻和偶尔在YouTube或Facebook上分享的模糊CCTV录像中获取了一些信息，但主动自卫并不是一种常见的需求。像大规模枪击或绑架这样的事件非常罕见。至于日常犯罪，正如第10章所述，大多数入室盗窃发生在住户不在家时——在这种情况下，枕头下放着的枪几乎没什么用处，反而成了盗贼容易拿到的东西。
- en: On the streets, many unwelcome encounters start off ambiguously and don’t escalate
    to deadly force. In such circumstances, being too eager to pull out a knife or
    a firearm to make a person back off could land you in legal trouble; even the
    use of pepper spray may count as assault. Naturally, violent confrontations can
    and do happen, and when a shadowy figure is closing in on you in a dark and empty
    parking lot, a weapon within reach can be worth the peace of mind. It’s just that
    the ultra-militaristic focus of many survivalist scholars goes too far.

  zh: 在街头，许多不愉快的遭遇开始时并不明确，并未升级到致命暴力。在这种情况下，过于急于拿出刀具或枪械逼退对方，可能会让你陷入法律麻烦；即便是使用胡椒喷雾，也可能被视为攻击行为。当然，暴力冲突确实会发生，当一个阴影般的人物在昏暗而空旷的停车场逼近时，身边有武器在手确实能带来一些心理安慰。只是，许多生存主义学者过度关注极端军事化的视角，走得有些过头。
- en: 'It also bears repeating that although the right to fight for your life is enshrined
    in most legal systems around the world, the realities of self-defense can be murky.
    This is especially true in places where the letter of the law no longer aligns
    with prevailing social attitudes. Take California, for example: the bestselling
    primer on the state’s labyrinthine gun regulations is the aptly titled *California
    Gun Laws*, a 560-page opus by C. D. Michel and Matthew D. Cubeiro (Coldaw Publishing,
    2020). The book is updated every single year, and on quite a few key questions,
    it simply states that the regulations are indecipherable and that it’s anyone’s
    guess as to how they might be interpreted by the prosecutors or the courts. In
    London, meanwhile, where guns are out of reach for most folks, the government
    would like a word about your pocket knife: in a 2018 tweet, the mayor said that
    there is “never a reason to carry a knife” and that those who do “will feel the
    full force of the law.”^([1](b02.xhtml#c24-endnote-1))'

  zh: 还需强调的是，尽管世界上大多数法律体系都保障了为保命而战的权利，但自卫的实际情况却往往模糊不清。这在那些法律条文与主流社会态度不再一致的地方尤为突出。以加利福尼亚为例：该州复杂的枪支法规有一本畅销的指南书，名为*加利福尼亚枪支法*，由C.
    D. Michel和Matthew D. Cubeiro编著（Coldaw Publishing，2020年）。这本书每年更新一次，书中对于一些关键问题的回答简直是“无法解读”，谁也无法猜测检察官或法院会如何解释这些法规。而在伦敦，枪支几乎难以接触到，政府倒是很愿意谈谈你的口袋刀：在2018年的一条推文中，市长表示“没有理由携带刀具”，并且那些携带刀具的人将“感受到法律的严惩”。^([1](b02.xhtml#c24-endnote-1))
- en: Once again, that’s not to say that actively defending oneself is a folly and
    that nothing but trouble awaits those who try. In certain times and places, having
    options is worth the price. It’s just that boisterous online slogans (say, “Better
    judged by twelve than carried by six”) are best set aside in favor of a measured
    evaluation of the trade-offs. At the same time, I urge equal caution against the
    politically tinged misinformation meant to dissuade you from considering the full
    spectrum of choices you might have.

  zh: 再次强调，这并不是说主动自卫是一种愚蠢的行为，试图自卫的人将只会招来麻烦。在某些时刻和地方，拥有选择权是值得付出代价的。只不过，喧嚣的网络口号（比如“宁愿由12个人审判，也不愿由6个人抬走”）最好暂时放一放，转而进行冷静的权衡评估。同时，我也提醒大家保持警惕，避免受那些具有政治色彩的误导性信息影响，这些信息往往试图让你放弃考虑自己可能拥有的多种选择。
- en: 'In the United States, the gun debate is a particular minefield of bad-faith
    arguments and sketchy science. We can disagree about policy, but from an individualistic
    point of view, the math seems simple: in a society where firearms are ubiquitous
    and commonly available to criminals, refusing to own a gun doesn’t appear to confer
    an obvious advantage in a confrontation with a perp. Yet, the allure of this argument
    is precisely what makes it anathema to some proponents of stricter gun control—and
    so, they strive to cast firearms not as normal tools, but as a unique menace that,
    if invited into your home, inevitably puts you in harm’s way. The argument is
    commonly backed by studies that count fragmentary reports of lawful self-defense
    killings, and then contrast them with comprehensive medical statistics of firearm-related
    suicides, accidental injuries, or even all gun homicides. The conclusion is simple:
    if you have a gun, you’re supposedly an order of magnitude more likely to harm
    yourself than save a loved one with it.'

  zh: 在美国，关于枪支的辩论充满了虚伪的论点和可疑的科学。我们可以在政策上有分歧，但从个体主义的角度来看，数学似乎很简单：在一个枪支无处不在、且罪犯也能轻易获得枪支的社会中，拒绝拥有枪支似乎并不会在与犯罪分子的对抗中带来明显的优势。然而，这个论点的吸引力正是它使得一些更严格枪支管制的支持者感到反感的原因——因此，他们努力将枪支描绘成不是普通工具，而是一个独特的威胁，如果让它进入你的家中，必然会将你置于危险之中。这个论点通常以研究为支持，这些研究统计了零星的合法自卫性杀戮报告，并将其与关于枪支相关自杀、意外伤害甚至所有枪支凶杀的综合医学统计数据进行对比。结论很简单：如果你拥有枪支，你显然更有可能伤害自己，而不是用它来拯救亲人。
- en: Of course, that comparison is apples to oranges. For one, although robust statistics
    on defensive gun uses in the United States are hard to come by, both sides contend
    the incidents probably exceed 100,000 a year—and most don’t involve firing a single
    shot, let alone killing anyone.^([2](b02.xhtml#c24-endnote-2)) In other words,
    lawful killings are an intentionally terrible proxy for “beneficial” outcomes
    of gun ownership.

  zh: 当然，这样的比较是不合适的。首先，尽管有关美国防卫性枪支使用的统计数据难以获取，但双方都认为每年可能发生超过100,000起相关事件，而且大多数事件并不涉及开枪，更不用说杀人了。^([2](b02.xhtml#c24-endnote-2))
    换句话说，合法的杀戮并不是“有益”枪支拥有结果的一个合理代表。
- en: The other side of the equation is lopsided too, although in a less obvious way.
    To illustrate the problem, let’s go with the somber example of suicides as a risk
    attributed to firearms. In countries with easy access to them, guns can be a common
    choice for suicidal individuals, and in the United States, they account for about
    24,000 out of 47,500 annual deaths.^([3](b02.xhtml#c24-endnote-3)) No rational
    person would disagree that removing firearms would cause *firearm* suicides to
    plummet. What doesn’t necessarily follow, yet what is implied in most analyses,
    is that doing so would also drastically reduce *total* suicides—in other words,
    that guns are an important causative factor, not just an implement of choice.

  zh: 方程式的另一面也同样失衡，尽管方式不那么明显。为了说明这一问题，我们可以用自杀作为枪支相关风险的沉重例子。在那些容易获得枪支的国家，枪支往往成为自杀者的常见选择，而在美国，枪支自杀大约占每年47,500例死亡中的24,000例。^([3](b02.xhtml#c24-endnote-3))
    任何理智的人都不会反对，如果移除枪支，*枪支*自杀将急剧下降。尽管大多数分析暗示，这样做也会大幅减少*总*自杀率——换句话说，枪支不仅仅是一个选择工具，而是一个重要的致因因素。
- en: This question is more complex than intuition may dictate. Consider that for
    many decades, the US per capita suicide rate trailed that of many developed countries
    with strict gun regimes, including much of Europe.^([4](b02.xhtml#c24-endnote-4))
    It’s true that the US rate started climbing rapidly around the time of the housing
    crisis of 2007 to 2009, and continues its upward trajectory to this day,^([5](b02.xhtml#c24-endnote-5))
    but this particular trend is more readily explained by economic shifts than by
    the proliferation of guns. Lastly, while the recent increases have put the United
    States ahead of some of its wealthy peers, its overall suicide rate is still in
    the same ballpark as that of Finland, Belgium, Latvia, or Japan.^([6](b02.xhtml#c24-endnote-6))

  zh: 这个问题比直觉所认为的更为复杂。考虑到，几十年来，美国的人均自杀率一直低于许多拥有严格枪支管理的发达国家，包括大部分欧洲国家。^([4](b02.xhtml#c24-endnote-4))
    的确，美国的自杀率在2007至2009年的住房危机期间开始急剧上升，并持续沿着上升轨迹发展，至今未见减缓。^([5](b02.xhtml#c24-endnote-5))
    但这一趋势更容易通过经济变化来解释，而非枪支的普及。最后，尽管近期的上升趋势使得美国的自杀率超过了一些富裕的同行国家，但整体自杀率仍然与芬兰、比利时、拉脱维亚或日本的自杀率相当。^([6](b02.xhtml#c24-endnote-6))
- en: In the end, knives, nunchucks, pepper spray, and firearms should be thought
    of as dangerous tools. Much like the car in your garage or the drugs in your medicine
    cabinet, they can cause terrible accidents and must be treated with care. Nothing
    good comes of approaching such tools with unconditional love—or with irrational
    fear—but when handled in a balanced way, a weapon can be a small building block
    of a comprehensive preparedness plan.

  zh: 最终，刀具、双截棍、胡椒喷雾和火器应该被视为危险工具。就像你车库里的汽车或药柜中的药物一样，它们可能会导致可怕的事故，因此必须小心使用。对待这些工具不能无条件地爱护，也不能以非理性的恐惧来看待——但当以平衡的方式使用时，武器可以成为全面备灾计划中的一个小小组成部分。

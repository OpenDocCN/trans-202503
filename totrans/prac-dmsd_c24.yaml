    despite what we pick up from 24-hour news and the grainy CCTV footage occasionally
    shared on YouTube or Facebook, active self-defense isn’t a common need. Events
    such as mass shootings or kidnappings are rare. As for everyday crime, as noted
    in Chapter 10, most burglaries happen when the occupants are away—and in such
    situations, a gun kept under the pillow isn’t of much use, except as an easy picking
    for whoever ransacks your home.'

    to deadly force. In such circumstances, being too eager to pull out a knife or
    a firearm to make a person back off could land you in legal trouble; even the
    use of pepper spray may count as assault. Naturally, violent confrontations can
    and do happen, and when a shadowy figure is closing in on you in a dark and empty
    parking lot, a weapon within reach can be worth the peace of mind. It’s just that
    the ultra-militaristic focus of many survivalist scholars goes too far.

    in most legal systems around the world, the realities of self-defense can be murky.
    This is especially true in places where the letter of the law no longer aligns
    with prevailing social attitudes. Take California, for example: the bestselling
    primer on the state’s labyrinthine gun regulations is the aptly titled *California
    Gun Laws*, a 560-page opus by C. D. Michel and Matthew D. Cubeiro (Coldaw Publishing,
    2020). The book is updated every single year, and on quite a few key questions,
    it simply states that the regulations are indecipherable and that it’s anyone’s
    guess as to how they might be interpreted by the prosecutors or the courts. In
    London, meanwhile, where guns are out of reach for most folks, the government
    would like a word about your pocket knife: in a 2018 tweet, the mayor said that
    there is “never a reason to carry a knife” and that those who do “will feel the
    full force of the law.”^([1](b02.xhtml#c24-endnote-1))'

    that nothing but trouble awaits those who try. In certain times and places, having
    options is worth the price. It’s just that boisterous online slogans (say, “Better
    judged by twelve than carried by six”) are best set aside in favor of a measured
    evaluation of the trade-offs. At the same time, I urge equal caution against the
    politically tinged misinformation meant to dissuade you from considering the full
    spectrum of choices you might have.

    arguments and sketchy science. We can disagree about policy, but from an individualistic
    point of view, the math seems simple: in a society where firearms are ubiquitous
    and commonly available to criminals, refusing to own a gun doesn’t appear to confer
    an obvious advantage in a confrontation with a perp. Yet, the allure of this argument
    is precisely what makes it anathema to some proponents of stricter gun control—and
    so, they strive to cast firearms not as normal tools, but as a unique menace that,
    if invited into your home, inevitably puts you in harm’s way. The argument is
    commonly backed by studies that count fragmentary reports of lawful self-defense
    killings, and then contrast them with comprehensive medical statistics of firearm-related
    suicides, accidental injuries, or even all gun homicides. The conclusion is simple:
    if you have a gun, you’re supposedly an order of magnitude more likely to harm
    yourself than save a loved one with it.'

    on defensive gun uses in the United States are hard to come by, both sides contend
    the incidents probably exceed 100,000 a year—and most don’t involve firing a single
    shot, let alone killing anyone.^([2](b02.xhtml#c24-endnote-2)) In other words,
    lawful killings are an intentionally terrible proxy for “beneficial” outcomes
    of gun ownership.

    To illustrate the problem, let’s go with the somber example of suicides as a risk
    attributed to firearms. In countries with easy access to them, guns can be a common
    choice for suicidal individuals, and in the United States, they account for about
    24,000 out of 47,500 annual deaths.^([3](b02.xhtml#c24-endnote-3)) No rational
    person would disagree that removing firearms would cause *firearm* suicides to
    plummet. What doesn’t necessarily follow, yet what is implied in most analyses,
    is that doing so would also drastically reduce *total* suicides—in other words,
    that guns are an important causative factor, not just an implement of choice.

    many decades, the US per capita suicide rate trailed that of many developed countries
    with strict gun regimes, including much of Europe.^([4](b02.xhtml#c24-endnote-4))
    It’s true that the US rate started climbing rapidly around the time of the housing
    crisis of 2007 to 2009, and continues its upward trajectory to this day,^([5](b02.xhtml#c24-endnote-5))
    but this particular trend is more readily explained by economic shifts than by
    the proliferation of guns. Lastly, while the recent increases have put the United
    States ahead of some of its wealthy peers, its overall suicide rate is still in
    the same ballpark as that of Finland, Belgium, Latvia, or Japan.^([6](b02.xhtml#c24-endnote-6))

    of as dangerous tools. Much like the car in your garage or the drugs in your medicine
    cabinet, they can cause terrible accidents and must be treated with care. Nothing
    good comes of approaching such tools with unconditional love—or with irrational
    fear—but when handled in a balanced way, a weapon can be a small building block
    of a comprehensive preparedness plan.

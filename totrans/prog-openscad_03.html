<p class="ChapterIntro">You’re now familiar with a good collection of basic OpenSCAD instructions for modeling simple 3D shapes, and you’ve seen operations that can transform those basic shapes into more complex designs. This chapter will teach you how to create and combine 2D shapes in order to build even more sophisticated 3D designs. </p>
<p>We’ll start by showing you how to draw basic 2D shapes, and then we’ll describe how to build on those basic 2D shapes to create elaborate 3D designs. Using 2D shapes will allow you to create designs that are not possible to build with the 3D shapes and operations you’ve learned so far. In addition, knowing how to create 2D shapes is useful when you’re designing for other digital fabrication techniques, such as laser cutting, though that’s beyond the scope of this book. </p>

<p class="BodyFirst">As with 3D shapes, you can build complex 2D shapes based on a few built-in 2D primitives, called <code>circle</code>, <code>square</code>, and <code>polygon</code>. </p>
<h3 id="h2-279547c03-0001">Drawing Circles with circle</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">The <code>circle</code> command allows you to draw a 2D circle by specifying its radius, like the <code>sphere</code> command from <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 1">Chapter 1</span>. For example, the following statement draws a circle with a radius of 20 units (<a href="#figure3-1" id="figureanchor3-1">Figure 3-1</a>):</p>
<pre><code>circle(20);</code></pre>
<figure>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure3-1">Figure 3-1</a>: A rendered circle with a radius of 20 units</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Clicking the <b>Preview</b> button renders your circle with a slight depth (<a href="#figure3-2" id="figureanchor3-2">Figure 3-2</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="41" id="Page_41"/>However, 2D shapes have no depth. They exist only in the xy-plane. To see 2D shapes in their true form, without depth, use the <b>Render</b> button. (Note that it’s not possible to mix 2D and 3D shapes in Render mode.) Because 2D shapes have no depth, it’s often easiest to create 2D designs by using the Top-view icon on the toolbar (<a href="#figure3-3" id="figureanchor3-3">Figure 3-3</a>). </p>

<h3 id="h2-279547c03-0002">Drawing Rectangles with square</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">The 2D <code>square</code> command, which draws rectangles, specifies x and y dimensions as a single vector parameter. The following statement draws a rectangle that extends 25 units along the x-axis and 10 units along the y-axis (<a href="#figure3-4" id="figureanchor3-4">Figure 3-4</a>):</p>
<pre><code>square([25, 10]);</code></pre>
<figure>
<img src="image_fi/279547c03/f03004.png" alt="f03004"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure3-4">Figure 3-4</a>: A rectangle with a width of 25 and height of 10 units</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Use the <code>square</code> command to indicate that you want to draw a rectangle, followed by a set of parentheses. Within the parentheses, put square brackets, and then within those, enter the dimensions of the square, separated by a comma. This 2D vector requires only x and y dimensions, as opposed to the 3D vector (x, y, and z) required by the 3D cube shape. The first number in the vector represents the width of the square along the x-axis. The second number in the vector represents the length of the square along the y-axis.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="42" id="Page_42"/>Remember that you’ll need to click the <b>Render</b> button to see the rectangle as a 2D shape.</p>
<h3 id="h2-279547c03-0003">Drawing Polygons with polygon</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">If you want to create a 2D shape that isn’t built into OpenSCAD, you can create your own 2D shapes with the <code>polygon</code> command. </p>
<p>The following statement uses the <code>polygon</code> command to draw a triangle with vertices at [0, 0], [10, 0], and [10, 10] (<a href="#figure3-5" id="figureanchor3-5">Figure 3-5</a>):</p>
<pre><code>polygon([ [0, 0], [10, 0], [10, 10] ]);</code></pre>
<figure>
<img src="image_fi/279547c03/f03005.png" alt="f03005"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure3-5">Figure 3-5</a>: A triangle with three vertices</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A polygon is defined by a list of the shape’s corners, called <em>vertices</em>. Each vertex in this list is a vector containing the coordinates of a corner point in the polygon. Group each vertex as a vector within square brackets, then add an extra set of brackets around the entire list of vertices to organize the collection as a vector of vectors.</p>
<p>Be sure to list the vertices in order, as though you were walking around the edge of the polygon (in either direction). Also, you don’t need to specify the starting point twice; OpenSCAD will finish the polygon for you automatically.</p>
<p>Since polygons can have any number of vertices, you can create increasingly complex shapes, like this one with eight vertices drawn with the following statement (<a href="#figure3-6" id="figureanchor3-6">Figure 3-6</a>): </p>
<pre><code>polygon([
  [ 0,  0], [20,  0],
  [20,  5], [ 5,  5],
  [ 5, 10], [20, 10],
  [20, 15], [ 0, 15]
]);</code></pre>

</figure>
<h3 id="h2-279547c03-0004">Drawing Words with text</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Another way to use 2D shapes in your designs is to create symbolic patterns, such as words. Using textual elements in your designs can be useful for personalization. You may also want to use emoji fonts to access pre-drawn symbols or simply stamp a version or serial number onto your design.</p>
<p>Use the <code>text</code> command to draw text shapes in OpenSCAD. Text in OpenSCAD (as in other programming languages) is considered a <em>string of characters.</em> Since a string of characters can be arbitrarily long, quotation marks (<code>" "</code>) are used to indicate the beginning and end of the text string. Text strings can contain letters, punctuation, numbers, and (if the font used supports Unicode) emoji characters. </p>
<p>This statement creates the string <code>"Hello, OpenSCAD"</code> (<a href="#figure3-7" id="figureanchor3-7">Figure 3-7</a>): </p>
<pre><code>text("Hello, OpenSCAD", size=10);</code></pre>
<figure>
<img src="image_fi/279547c03/f03007.png" alt="f03007"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure3-7">Figure 3-7</a>: Creating a 2D <span class="LiteralInCaption"><code>text</code></span> shape</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="44" id="Page_44"/>Follow the <code>text</code> command with parentheses containing a string of characters. The strings should start and stop with double quotes (<code>" "</code>). The parentheses can also contain an optional <code>size</code> parameter, which sets the text size to 10 in this case. Notice in <a href="#figure3-7">Figure 3-7</a> that the tallest letters in the string reach the first tick mark (which represents 10 units) on the y-axis.</p>
<p>The <code>size</code> parameter is optional for text shapes. If you leave off the <code>size</code> parameter, the default text size is 10. Another optional parameter for drawing text shapes is <code>font</code>. You can also use the optional <code>font</code> parameter to draw text in any font installed on your computer. The following statement draws a string of text in Courier font (<a href="#figure3-8" id="figureanchor3-8">Figure 3-8</a>):</p>
<pre><code>text("Hello, OpenSCAD", font="Courier");</code></pre>

<div class="bottom hr"><hr/></div>
</section>
</aside>
<p>Fonts that support Unicode characters will often contain emoji. You can draw any character supported by the font, including emoji shapes (<a href="#figure3-9" id="figureanchor3-9">Figure 3-9</a>):</p>
<pre><code>text("<span class="SymbolGame">♕</span>", font="Arial Unicode MS");</code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="45" id="Page_45"/> It’s also possible to draw numeric values with the <code>text</code> command. If you want to create a shape with a numeric value (<a href="#figure3-10" id="figureanchor3-10">Figure 3-10</a>), be sure to convert the value to a string with the <code>str</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>text(str(123), size=20);</code></pre>
<figure>
<img src="image_fi/279547c03/f03010.png" alt="f03010"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure3-10">Figure 3-10</a>: Drawing a <span class="LiteralInCaption"><code>text</code></span> shape with numbers </p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Rather than putting the number between quotation marks, apply the <code>str</code> function to a numeric value in order to turn it into a string. This is particularly helpful when the numeric value is stored in a variable, as we’ll see in Chapter 4.</p>
<h2 id="h1-279547c03-0002">Applying Transformation and Boolean Operations on 2D Shapes</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">You can apply the same transformation and Boolean operations you learned in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapters 1">Chapters 1</span> and <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_2">2</span> to 2D shapes—and it’s done pretty much the same way as when you apply them to 3D shapes. The only difference is that instead of requiring 3D vectors, the <code>translate</code>, <code>mirror</code>, and <code>resize</code> operations require 2D vectors containing x- and y-coordinates, and the <code>rotate</code> operation requires only a single angle of rotation (for the z-axis).</p>
<p>For example, the following design uses <code>translate</code>, <code>difference</code>, and <code>rotate</code> to draw an askew rectangle with three circles cut out of it (<a href="#figure3-11" id="figureanchor3-11">Figure 3-11</a>):</p>
<pre><code>rotate(30) {
    difference() {
        square([120, 40]);
        translate([20, 20]) circle(15);
        translate([60, 20]) circle(15);
        translate([100, 20]) circle(15);
    }
}</code></pre>

</figure>
<p>Just as with the 3D shapes, the order in which you apply transformations and Boolean operations on a 2D shape will affect the arrangement and placement of the resulting shape. Consider the difference between subtracting a circle from a square versus subtracting a square from a circle. The following <code>difference</code> operation subtracts a circle from a square (<a href="#figure3-12" id="figureanchor3-12">Figure 3-12</a>):</p>
<pre><code>difference() {
    square([5, 5]);
    circle(5, $fn=50);
}</code></pre>

<h2 id="h1-279547c03-0003">Extruding Shapes Vertically with linear_extrude</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">You can’t 3D-print 2D shapes directly, but you can use them as building blocks for creating 3D shapes (which can then be 3D-printed as physical objects). This section describes two of OpenSCAD’s powerful operations for creating 3D shapes from 2D shapes.</p>
<p>The <code>linear_extrude</code> operation takes a flat shape and “lifts” it up along the z-axis while building walls corresponding to the shape’s initial boundary. The following statement extrudes the letter <em>A</em> into a 3D shape with a height of 5 units (<a href="#figure3-14" id="figureanchor3-14">Figure 3-14</a>):</p>
<pre><code>linear_extrude(5) text("A");</code></pre>
<p>The <code>linear_extrude</code> operation takes a single parameter, the height of the 3D shape you’re creating, followed by the 2D shape you’d like to stretch into 3D. As with the transformation operations you already know, end the entire statement with a semicolon. </p>
<p>You could also provide the <code>linear_extrude</code> operation the optional parameters of <code>twist</code>, <code>slices</code>, and <code>scale</code> to build more complex 3D shapes. The <code>twist</code> parameter specifies an angle at which to twist the 2D shape during extrusion. The <code>slices</code> parameter controls how smooth a twist will be—specifically, how many segments will be used to complete the twist. <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="48" id="Page_48"/>Since extrusion extends a shape upward, each of these segments will turn into a horizontal “slice,” which is why the parameter is named <code>slices</code>. If you don’t specify it, OpenSCAD will choose a relatively coarse value. The <code>scale</code> parameter changes the size of the 2D shape during extrusion.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure3-14">Figure 3-14</a>: Linear extrusion of a 2D shape into a 3D shape</p></figcaption>

<p>Use all of these parameters to transform a rectangle into the 3D shape drawn in <a href="#figure3-15" id="figureanchor3-15">Figure 3-15</a>:</p>
<pre><code>linear_extrude(100, twist=30, slices=25, scale=1/3) {
  square(100, center=true);
}</code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="49" id="Page_49"/>The parameters <code>twist</code>, <code>slices</code>, and <code>scale</code> are optional. Although this example shows all three parameters used at once, you can use any variation, such as only <code>scale</code> or only <code>twist</code>.</p>
<h2 id="h1-279547c03-0004">Extruding Shapes Along a Circle with rotate_extrude</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Rather than extruding a 2D shape along a linear path, use the <code>rotate_extrude</code> operation to move the 2D shape along a circular path, which creates a donut-like shape called a <em>torus </em>(<a href="#figure3-16" id="figureanchor3-16">Figure 3-16</a>):</p>
<pre><code>rotate_extrude() {
  translate([100, 0]) circle(40);
}</code></pre>
<figure>
<img src="image_fi/279547c03/f03016.png" alt="f03016"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure3-16">Figure 3-16</a>: The <span class="LiteralInCaption"><code>rotate_extrude</code></span> operation of a 2D circle into a 3D torus</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The <code>rotate_extrude</code> operation is a two-step process that first rotates the 2D shape by 90 degrees around the x-axis, then moves the 2D shape in a circle around the z-axis. If you were to cut out a slice of the resulting donut, the shape of that slice would look like the original 2D shape. </p>
<p>When using <code>rotate_extrude</code>, take care to ensure that the shape doesn’t rotate into itself. In the code that draws <a href="#figure3-16">Figure 3-16</a>, you do this by first translating the shape away from the z-axis so that no parts of the 2D shape are touching the z-axis.</p>
<p>The <code>rotate_extrude</code> operation also takes an optional <code>angle</code> parameter that allows you to specify the angle of rotation. <a href="#figure3-17" id="figureanchor3-17">Figure 3-17</a> demonstrates a circle that has been extruded along a 135-degree rotation around the z-axis.</p>
<pre><code>rotate_extrude(angle=135) {
  translate([100, 0]) circle(40);
}</code></pre>

<h2>Tips for Using multiple lines instead of single lines</h2>
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Though we use curly brackets to help visually organize these <code>rotate_extrude</code> examples, curly brackets are optional if they enclose a single shape. So this multiline statement</p>
<pre><code>rotate_extrude() {
    translate([100, 0]) {
        circle(40);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p class="BoxBodyContinued">is the same as this single-line statement:</p>

<p>OpenSCAD ignores both the spaces between elements and new lines, so you have some flexibility in how you organize your code to make it more (or less) readable. While using indentation, new lines, and curly brackets can help communicate the nuances of a complex sequence of operations, consolidating elements onto one line can also be useful once you become more comfortable coding with OpenSCAD.</p>

<h2 id="h1-279547c03-0005">Growing and Shrinking a Shape with offset</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Imagine you want to build a fancy cross-shaped cookie cutter. You now know how to create a cross shape by performing a union of two rectangles, and you know how to extrude it by using <code>linear_extrude</code> to make it 3D. But to specify the wall thickness, you need the <code>offset</code> operation, which allows you either to grow or shrink a shape by a specific amount. Use <code>offset</code> to hollow out your cookie cutter by shrinking one cross, and then subtract the small cross from the larger one. </p>
<p>In the following design, pass <code>offset</code> a negative value to shrink your 2D cross (<a href="#figure3-18" id="figureanchor3-18">Figure 3-18</a>):</p>
<pre><code>offset(-2) {
  union() {
    square([100, 30], center=true);
    square([30, 100], center=true);
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Place the code for the 2D shapes to offset in curly brackets following the <code>offset</code> operation. In parentheses, specify the amount (in millimeters) to offset. A positive value will grow a shape, and a negative value will shrink a shape.</p>

<h2 id="h1-279547c03-0006">Importing 2D Shapes with import</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Just as with 3D shapes, you can import 2D shapes from files created in other 2D design programs. OpenSCAD supports importing the <em>.dxf </em>and<em> .svg</em> 2D file formats. These formats are commonly used with popular 2D vector graphic design tools, such as Adobe Illustrator and Inkscape (an open source alternative to Adobe Illustrator). OpenSCAD only supports importing shapes that are closed polygons, containing no “open-ended” sections. Also, make sure you convert all segments in a <em>.dxf</em> file to straight lines.</p>
<p>The syntax of the <code>import</code> command is the same for importing both 2D and 3D shapes. You just need to pass the filename in quotation marks to <code>import</code>, and make sure the file is saved in the same folder/directory as your project. For example, use the following statement to import the drawing in <a href="#figure3-20" id="figureanchor3-20">Figure 3-20</a>:</p>
<pre><code>import("drawing.dxf");</code></pre>
<figure>
<img src="image_fi/279547c03/f03020.png" alt="f03020"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure3-20">Figure 3-20</a>: An imported <em>.dxf</em> vector graphic</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Even though the imported file looks round, it actually consists of many short line segments, similar to the polygons you learned to create earlier in this chapter. Inkscape was used to draw this 2D smiley-face shape. An important final step in the process was to convert all of the line segments in the shape to very small straight lines.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="54" id="Page_54"/>Once you import a 2D shape, it behaves exactly like a built-in shape, and you can transform it and combine it with other shapes. The following statement first imports the smiley face shown in <a href="#figure3-20">Figure 3-20</a>, then extrudes it into the shape shown in <a href="#figure3-21" id="figureanchor3-21">Figure 3-21</a>:</p>
<pre><code>linear_extrude(height=500, scale=3) import("drawing.dxf");</code></pre>

<p>Now you have a 3D smiley-face shape that you can 3D-print as a stamp. </p>
<h2 id="h1-279547c03-0007">Summary</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">In this chapter, you learned how to design and create 3D shapes based on 2D shapes. You now should be able to create, combine, and transform simple 2D shapes like circles, rectangles, polygons, and text. You can create both internal and external outlines of 2D shapes with the <code>offset</code> operation, import vector graphics, and transform 2D shapes into 3D shapes.</p>
<p>By now you should be able to imagine a wide variety of designs that you could create with OpenSCAD 2D and 3D shapes. Sometimes it’s easier to build a complex 3D design by thinking about its 2D shadow first, and then you can stretch the 2D shadow into 3D. </p>
<p>Here are some important points to remember when working with 2D shapes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rendering a 2D design will display the actual 2D view of the shape, while a Preview window of the design will appear to add a small amount of height along the z-axis.</li>
<li>3D shape transformation vectors require three parameters: [x, y, z]; most 2D shape transformation vectors require only two parameters: [x, y]. </li>
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="55" id="Page_55"/>2D rotations need only a single parameter: a number to represent the angle of rotation within the xy-plane.</li>
<li>The Top view will often give you the best perspective when designing your 2D shapes.</li>
<li>Extruding 2D shapes and text is necessary in order to combine them with 3D shapes.</li>
<li>Text strings start and stop with double quotes.</li>
<li>You can use the <code>text</code> shape to draw numeric values by converting the value to a string with the <code>str</code> function.</li>
<li>Only fonts that support Unicode can be used to draw emoji, but think of how much fun you could have extruding emoji shapes!</li>
<li>No part of a 2D shape can cross the z-axis when you use <code>rotate_extrude</code> on that shape.</li>
<li>Think of 2D shapes as a “cross section” of the resulting 3D shape from a <code>rotate_extrude</code> operation. </li>
</ul>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Continue to practice the skills you learned in Chapters 1 through 3 with these three big projects.</p>
<h4>Storytelling Dice</h4>
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Use the basic game die you created in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 2">Chapter 2</span> to generate a collection of storytelling dice (<a href="#figure3-23" id="figureanchor3-32">Figure 3-23</a>). Create dice for nouns, verbs, decisions, animals, heroes, villains, or any collection of related concepts. This will help you practice using and placing <code>text</code> shapes.</p>

<p class="BoxListHead"><b>3D-Printing Tip for the Storytelling Dice</b></p>
<ol class="none">
<li>OpenSCAD is “unit-less.” Often, but not always, if you import an <em>.stl</em> file to prepare it for 3D printing, the software will use millimeters as the unit for your design. It’s important to adjust final dimensions for your 3D model as the last step before printing your model. Use the scaling features of your 3D-printing preparation software to check/change the final dimensions of your 3D print.</li>
<li>Play around with resizing your storytelling dice. What size makes the most sense? Be sure to make the dice big enough so you can read the text on all sides.</li>
</ol>
<h3><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="58" id="Page_58"/>Project Box for Storytelling Dice</h3>
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Create a project box to hold your storytelling dice (<a href="#figure3-24" id="figureanchor3-24">Figure 3-24</a>). Practice using the <code>offset</code> operation to create a ridge in the wall of the box to keep the lid firmly in place. Don’t forget to make small adjustments to the measurements of the lid so that the inner ridge fits snugly inside the box.</p>

<p class="BoxListHead"><b>3D-Printing Tip for the Project Box</b></p>
<ol class="none">
<li>This box needs to be big enough to hold your storytelling dice with the lid in place. Most 3D-printing preparation software will allow you to change the size of your 3D model either by specifying a scalar percentage for each axis or by setting an absolute size for a certain dimension. You can set the other axes and dimensions to scale either uniformly or not at all.</li>
</ol>
<h3><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="59" id="Page_59"/>Trophy</h3>
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Create a trophy (<a href="#figure3-25" id="figureanchor3-35">Figure 3-25</a>) by using the shapes and operations introduced in this chapter. Start by designing a 2D profile of the cup and stem that you can rotate around the z-axis with <code>rotate_extrude</code>. Notice the embellishments on some of the edges of the trophy.</p>

<p class="BoxListHead"><b>3D-Printing Tip for the Trophy</b></p>
<ol class="none">
<li>Each 3D printer has its own <em>build volume</em> that determines the maximum measurement for each dimension of your 3D print. Be sure to stay within the build dimensions for your printer when you resize your model. In fact, your 3D-printing preparation software will warn you if you’re exceeding your printer’s dimensions. </li>
<li>Try to print this trophy at a larger size than the build volume of your 3D printer. You can accomplish this by splitting your final trophy into two parts: the base and the trophy. By using the <code>difference</code> operation, you can split your model into two pieces. Export each of these as separate <em>.stl</em> files, each containing a different part of the trophy. Then, scale each part in the 3D-printing preparation software so that you can print each separate piece to be as large as possible. A little superglue will allow you to recombine the two pieces into one extra-large trophy.</li>

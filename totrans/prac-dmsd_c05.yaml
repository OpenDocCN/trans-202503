- en: 'In a parallel universe, preparing for disasters could be like shopping for
    car insurance: a boring necessity taken care of in a day and then duly forgotten
    for another year. Here in our dimension, that’s most certainly not the case. For
    many preppers, what starts as a cautious inquiry into a fringe subculture soon
    morphs into a passion that influences most other aspects of life.'

- en: 'For some, the allure of prepping lies in the intellectual thrill of conducting
    complex thought experiments. For others, it’s about the connections made with
    like-minded hobbyists on the internet. And for a small minority, the fascination
    is rooted in a darker impulse: the conviction that the world is rotten and deeply
    unjust, and that it’s only a matter of time before the deception is laid bare
    and everything spirals out of control.'

    fertile ground for peddlers of doomsday goods. From camouflage clothing to custom-designed
    backyard bunkers, there’s no limit to how much a fearful prepper can spend. Yet,
    buying more stuff never offers closure. As soon as one shipment arrives, the doomsayer
    celebrities on YouTube come up with another “tactical” and “mil-spec” essential
    to add to the cart.

- en: I believe that such fear-driven consumption isn’t a game worth playing. It’s
    much healthier to look at emergency preparedness as having a Plan B just in case,
    rather than putting the apocalypse smack dab in the middle of your Plan A. Any
    expenditure of time, money, or mental energy on survival strategies must be balanced
    against the impact it will have on your normal life.

- en: This isn’t to say that there’s no room for survival tools in a comprehensive
    preparedness plan. In due time, we’ll examine topics ranging from the value of
    an extra jug of water to the merits of firearms. But in an attempt to break with
    the tired formulas of the genre, I want to devote the second part of this book
    to lifestyle adaptations that don’t involve spending a single penny on specialized
    prepper equipment or learning how to skin deer. Much of the content in the next
    couple of chapters revolves around topics that are considered unbecoming of any
    hard-boiled survivalist, from personal finance to staying safe online. But what
    this advice lacks in glamour, it should make up for in utility and depth.

- en: There is far too much information about I²C controllers and peripheral devices
    to include in a single book. Even if it were possible, new I²C devices will undoubtedly
    appear during and after the publication of this book. To resolve this issue, this
    book is paired with several online chapters freely available at [https://bookofi2c.randallhyde.com](https://bookofi2c.randallhyde.com).

- en: The following online chapters are currently planned for inclusion. At the time
    of printing, some may already be available, while others may be “in the works.”
    As time permits (and as new devices appear), I will attempt to add additional
    chapters not listed here.

    are current sensors that allow you to track the power used in a circuit. This
    is useful for battery monitoring and other circuits where you need to track the
    current through the system. This chapter discusses how to program each of these
    parts.'

    contains useful information such as sample builds (pictures and schematics) for
    many of the examples appearing throughout this book. It will also contain links
    to useful information concerning programming I²C controllers and peripherals.
    Check the website for the latest updates.

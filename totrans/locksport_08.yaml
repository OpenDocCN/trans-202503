    main competitions at locksport events around the world! In this appendix, we’ll
    discuss a few locksport games that are frequently played at conferences or run
    by locksport organizations, but aren’t part of the main competition. We’ll cover
    the timed head-to-head challenge; a locksport spin on tic-tac-toe; escape challenges;
    bike lock decoding; and “The Room,” a spy-themed contest. We’ll end by taking
    a look at Reddit’s belt system, one way to challenge yourself and earn public
    accolades from the online locksport community.

- en: One competition that appears frequently at conferences like ShmooCon, DEF CON,
    and various BSides events is the timed *head-to-head deadbolt picking challenge*
    ([Figure A-1](app01.xhtml#app01fig1)). Competitors are seated at wooden stands,
    each containing a pin tumbler deadbolt lock. Each deadbolt is the same brand,
    and all the locks are keyed alike (pinned the same). Each stand contains a built-in
    switch that’s continually depressed by the bolt until the lock is picked. Those
    switches are wired to a circuit board or small computer, often an Arduino or Raspberry
    Pi, which is connected to a timer display that shows the opening time when the
    switch is triggered.

  zh: 在像 ShmooCon、DEF CON 和各种 BSides 事件等会议中，经常出现的一项比赛是计时的*正面对抗死锁挑选挑战*（[图 A-1](app01.xhtml#app01fig1)）。参赛者坐在木制支架前，每个支架上都安装有一个针式死锁。每把死锁都是相同品牌，所有锁的钥匙都是一样的（内部结构相同）。每个支架都有一个内建开关，直到锁被打开时，这个开关才会被压下。这些开关连接到电路板或小型计算机，通常是
    Arduino 或 Raspberry Pi，连接到计时器显示屏，显示触发开关时的开启时间。

    one used by TOOOL US at large conferences ([Figure A-3](app01.xhtml#app01fig3)),
    and one created by Matt and his friend and fellow hacker volty for use at events
    around Seattle. Three of these designs are functionally the same for competitors,

- en: 'At first glance, the timed challenge may seem pretty easy: you need to pick
    just one lock, and usually it’s not even a high-security model. However, several
    factors make this challenge unique.'
  id: totrans-15
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 初看之下，计时挑战似乎非常简单：你只需要开锁一把，而且通常这把锁也不是高安全性的型号。然而，有几个因素让这个挑战与众不同。
- en: First is the stand itself. Having the lock mounted to a board can be a surprising
    twist for locksporters who typically hold their locks or mount them in a vise
    at an angle that suits them. Since picking in this position might feel awkward
    to you, consider practicing on a lock mounted on a vertical surface before entering
    this competition. You might also want to ask the judge if you’re allowed to move
    the stand before you start; placing it on your lap might be more comfortable.
  id: totrans-16
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 第一项是支架本身。将锁具固定在板子上可能会让那些通常手持锁具或将锁具固定在符合自己角度的虎钳中的锁匠感到惊讶。由于这种姿势可能会让你感到不适，建议你在参加比赛前练习使用固定在垂直表面的锁具。你也可以向裁判询问比赛前是否可以移动支架；将支架放在腿上可能会更舒适。
- en: Second, unlike most locksport picking competitions, in this event it matters
    which direction you turn the plug. Unlocking the deadbolt requires retracting
    the bolt, meaning the plug needs to rotate away from the bolt. Whether this means
    you need to turn the plug clockwise or counterclockwise depends on which way the
    lock is mounted. For the stand in [Figure A-2](app01.xhtml#app01fig2), you’d need
    to turn the plug counterclockwise to open it. Many contestants miss this detail
    and waste valuable time picking the lock in the wrong direction.
  id: totrans-17
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 第二，与大多数锁匠竞技比赛不同，在这个赛事中，插头转动的方向非常重要。解锁死锁需要回缩锁舌，这意味着插头需要朝锁舌的相反方向旋转。你需要顺时针还是逆时针转动插头，取决于锁具的安装方式。对于[图
    A-2](app01.xhtml#app01fig2)中的支架，你需要逆时针转动插头才能解锁。许多参赛者会错过这个细节，浪费宝贵的时间错误地转动插头。
- en: Third, rules about placing tension wrenches in the lock before you start picking
    can vary from event to event. Positioning the wrench ahead of time can save you
    valuable seconds, so be sure to ask the judge before the round starts whether
    this is allowed. If it isn’t, ask if you can at least test various turning tools
    first to see which fits best.
  id: totrans-18
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 第三，关于开始撬锁前是否可以放置张力扳手的规则在不同的比赛中可能有所不同。提前放置扳手可以节省宝贵的时间，因此比赛开始前一定要向裁判询问是否允许这样做。如果不允许，询问是否可以至少先测试各种转动工具，看看哪个最合适。
- en: Fourth, going head-to-head with other people can be intimidating, especially
    when a timer is running. Try to focus on the lockpicking, not on the timer or
    on anyone else’s progress. Also try to ignore any spectators, as this type of
    contest is quite visual and can sometimes draw a crowd. If you’re easily distracted
    by other people, consider trying to find a lull in the crowd sometime during the
    event and play then. In lockpick villages at large events, lunch breaks and breaks
    between talks are usually busy times and best avoided by those who suffer under
    pressure.
  id: totrans-19
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 第四，与他人正面交锋可能会让人感到紧张，尤其是当计时器启动时。尽量集中精力在撬锁上，而不是计时器或其他人的进展。也要尽量忽略旁观者，因为这种比赛具有很强的视觉效果，有时会吸引人群。如果你容易被其他人分心，可以考虑在比赛过程中找个空隙时段再参加。在大型活动中的锁匠村，午餐时间和演讲之间的休息时间通常很忙碌，最好避开那些容易承受压力的人。
- en: Finally, check the rules for do-overs. Some competitions allow you to retry
    the contest only a set number of times, if at all. Others may take your best time
    during the event, or they might average all of your times. Based on the rules,
    decide whether you’re likely to improve your time by trying the contest more than
    once. However, be considerate of other competitors and the judges’ time. Even
    if retries aren’t limited, having one contestant keep trying the contest continually
    throughout an event can be annoying, especially if judges are overseeing multiple
    events.
  id: totrans-20
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 最后，检查是否允许重新挑战。一些比赛只允许你重新挑战一定次数（如果允许的话）。其他比赛可能会根据你在比赛中的最佳成绩来评定，或者可能会将所有的时间取平均值。根据规则决定是否值得多次尝试比赛以提高成绩。然而，请考虑到其他参赛者和裁判的时间。即使重赛次数没有限制，如果有一名参赛者在整个活动期间不断尝试比赛，这也可能会让人觉得烦躁，尤其是在裁判需要监督多个赛事的情况下。

    easy. Matt published the code needed to run the timer on a Raspberry Pi on GitHub
    at *[https://github.com/mburrough/locktimer](https://github.com/mburrough/locktimer)*,
    so building a set is mainly a woodworking project. Here we’ll list the materials
    to build four stands, but feel free to adjust up or down depending on your needs.
    Since this design uses US-style deadbolt locks, we’re also specifying the materials
    in imperial units. Materials in metric equivalents should work just as well. If
    you’re looking to build only one set for home practice, just quarter the material
    quantities.

    Luckily, the friendly folks at FoxPick have offered several suggestions for competitors.
    First, as with the head-to-head challenge, players should practice picking locks
    mounted on boards. Since the PicTacToe board is even larger than the head-to-head
    lock stands, players won’t be able to make significant adjustments to the position
    or angle of the locks.
  id: totrans-100
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 由于这是一款相对较新的游戏，我们至今还没有机会尝试PicTacToe。幸运的是，FoxPick的友好人士为参赛者提供了一些建议。首先，和一对一挑战一样，玩家应该练习在板子上开锁。由于PicTacToe的棋盘比一对一锁具支架要大，玩家将无法对锁的位置或角度进行显著调整。
- en: Second, the locks in PicTacToe aren’t all the same. The center lock is the hardest,
    the corners are medium difficulty, and the four remaining locks are the easiest.
    Having a strategy for which lock to target first and which row/column/diagonal
    you plan to pick before starting will save you time during the competition.
  id: totrans-101
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 第二，PicTacToe中的锁并不完全相同。中心锁是最难的，角落锁的难度适中，剩下的四个锁是最容易的。在比赛开始之前，制定一个锁定目标的策略，确定先选择哪个锁，计划好选取哪一行/列/对角线，将在比赛中节省时间。
- en: Third, since rakes aren’t allowed, practice picking using standard hooks. You
    may also want to practice with picks other than your usual set. Since picks are
    provided, it’s best to be comfortable working with one that isn’t your favorite.
  id: totrans-102

  zh: 第三，既然不允许使用起子，练习使用标准钩子开锁。你可能还想用与平时不同的开锁工具进行练习。因为提供了工具，所以最好能熟练使用一个你不太喜欢的工具。
- en: Lastly, this is a player-versus-player contest, so it’s a good idea to practice
    picking under pressure against someone. Also consider whether you’ll just go for
    the locks you need to open or also try to block your opponent by targeting a lock
    in the row they’ve selected.
  id: totrans-103

    These teeth of the single strand interact with a *pawl* inside the handcuff’s
    housing, which is a spring-loaded piece of metal with a few teeth of its own and
    is similar to the latch found in a padlock (see [Figure A-12](app01.xhtml#app01fig12)).
    The locking mechanism for these cuffs is essentially a warded lock. A small protrusion

- en: The wafer locks used on filing cabinets, phone-dial locks, and even vehicles
    may also be unfamiliar to you from a locksport perspective. Wafer locks are similar
    to pin tumbler locks in that they contain several blocking elements that need
    to be lifted to the correct height to allow the plug to rotate, so it’s possible
    to approach picking them as you would a pin tumbler lock. However, you should
    be aware of a few tricks and gotchas when you’re dealing with wafers.

- en: First, wafers are flat plates, not round cylinders like pins. They have no shear
    line, but if you lift them too high, they’ll block at the top of the plug rather
    than catching at the bottom. Particularly sharp or aggressively used rakes can
    then catch on the wafers, potentially damaging them, the small springs used to
    hold them, or even the rake itself.

- en: Second, wafers can come from both the top and bottom of the keyway, so on some
    locks you’ll need to move some wafers upward and some downward. For this reason,
    *ball-end* and *double-ball* picks (also called *snowman* picks), shown in [Figure
    A-17](app01.xhtml#app01fig17), are popular choices for wafer locks. While these
    picks are often scorned in pin tumbler picking, their gentle curves and double-sidedness
    do well on wafers. Having said that, regular hooks and rakes will also work on
    wafer locks.

- en: 'Next, most wafer locks contain only a few wafers. For file cabinet–type locks,
    three to five wafers is the norm. Additionally, their tolerances are often poor,
    meaning the wafers aren’t precisely set to the correct standardized height. Taken
    together, these two traits mean that key-shaped objects might well open such a
    lock. Enter the *wafer jiggler* set: thin pieces of metal cut into shapes that
    look vaguely key-like, as you can see in [Figure A-18](app01.xhtml#app01fig18).
    By inserting these in the lock (one at a time) and using rocking, raking, or jiggling
    motions, you have a good chance of opening the lock. You can purchase jigglers
    from many of the same sellers as regular lock picks.'

- en: Another method of opening wafer locks involves using a flat piece of metal,
    like the handle of a pick or an uncut key that fits the keyway. Insert the object
    all the way into the keyway, using it both to lift all the wafers and to apply
    slight rotational pressure on the plug. Then, while still applying turning pressure,
    slowly pull out the object. Because of the lateral pressure, the wafers may bind
    on the lock housing as they drop, allowing the plug to rotate. This can take some
    practice and may not work on higher-quality locks.
  id: totrans-150
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'If all these methods fail, simply try single-pin picking the wafers or raking
    with your least aggressively shaped rake. One final word of caution: some wafer
    plugs are held in their housing by the rearmost wafer in the lock, which is usually
    spaced a bit farther away from the other wafers. If you pick this wafer, which
    is especially likely if you’re raking the lock, the entire plug will come out
    of the lock. This feature allows a special key to remove the plug to make rekeying
    easy. If this happens, you might still be able to open the lock by reaching a
    tool into the back of the housing and rotating the cam or manipulating the latch
    directly. To reinstall the plug, depress the wafers so they’re flush with the
    plug and slip the plug back into the housing.'

    *direct-entry* combination padlocks and cheap bike chains, with too many variations
    and manufacturers to name. These generally have three, four, or occasionally five
    code wheels, like the one shown in [Figure A-19](app01.xhtml#app01fig19). Each
    code wheel has one gate through which the teeth can pass, so when all the gates
    are aligned, all the teeth can pass and the lock opens. The better locks include
    one or two smaller false gates that the teeth can’t fit through to make it harder
    to find the true gate.

    Pulling on the shackle will cause one or more of the wheels to tilt or jam against
    a tooth (see [Figure A-20](app01.xhtml#app01fig20)). Simply find the wheel that
    is binding (it will be the most difficult wheel to turn), and rotate it until
    it is free, or loose, or wobbly. Often the shackle will come out a little too.
    Now locate the next wheel that’s binding and repeat the process until the lock

    they’re smaller. With practice, you can differentiate them from a true gate by
    feel; a true gate will give a bit more play in the shackle than a false one. Even
    if you haven’t mastered differentiating false and true gates, you’ll find that
    once all the positions are set on a gate, you can easily tell which wheel is in
    a false gate, as it will start to bind again. Often there’s only one false gate
    per wheel, which is usually directly opposite the true gate. Sometimes, however,
    two or four false gates are located at fixed intervals all the way around.

    long, with a handle bent into one end and a hook bent into the other, shown in
    [Figure A-22](app01.xhtml#app01fig22). A flexible wire, slightly longer than the
    rigid wire, is connected to the hook end. You slip the tool in the gap between
    the bottom of the door and the floor and rotate it upward to hook the door handle.
    Pulling down on the flexible wire flexes the rigid wire, pulling down on the door
    handle.'

- en: You can sometimes decode briefcase wheel locks like direct-entry bike locks—by
    pressing the release button on the case while spinning the wheels. If this doesn’t
    work, you could slip a thin piece of metal between a wheel and the lock housing,
    rotate the wheel, and try to feel for any notches or flat sections of the wheel;
    then repeat this for the other wheels. If you’ve found a flat section or notch
    on each wheel and the case doesn’t open, rotate all the wheels in the same direction
    and try again. For example, if you found notches at 3-7-2, try 4-8-3, then 5-9-4,
    and so forth. Many wheeled combination locks, like the one shown in [Figure A-25](app01.xhtml#app01fig25),
    can be decoded this way.

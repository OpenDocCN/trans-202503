    main competitions at locksport events around the world! In this appendix, we’ll
    discuss a few locksport games that are frequently played at conferences or run
    by locksport organizations, but aren’t part of the main competition. We’ll cover
    the timed head-to-head challenge; a locksport spin on tic-tac-toe; escape challenges;
    bike lock decoding; and “The Room,” a spy-themed contest. We’ll end by taking
    a look at Reddit’s belt system, one way to challenge yourself and earn public
    accolades from the online locksport community.

- en: One competition that appears frequently at conferences like ShmooCon, DEF CON,
    and various BSides events is the timed *head-to-head deadbolt picking challenge*
    ([Figure A-1](app01.xhtml#app01fig1)). Competitors are seated at wooden stands,
    each containing a pin tumbler deadbolt lock. Each deadbolt is the same brand,
    and all the locks are keyed alike (pinned the same). Each stand contains a built-in
    switch that’s continually depressed by the bolt until the lock is picked. Those
    switches are wired to a circuit board or small computer, often an Arduino or Raspberry
    Pi, which is connected to a timer display that shows the opening time when the
    switch is triggered.

    can. Sometimes the fastest person to open in each group is dubbed the winner,
    though more often every competitor’s time is recorded over the course of a day,
    and the best times win a prize.

    of the Fraternal Order Of Lock Sport (FOOLS) club in Indiana ([Figure A-2](app01.xhtml#app01fig2)),
    one used by TOOOL US at large conferences ([Figure A-3](app01.xhtml#app01fig3)),
    and one created by Matt and his friend and fellow hacker volty for use at events
    around Seattle. Three of these designs are functionally the same for competitors,
    though one of Dosman’s also includes rumble motors to make the locks shake, increasing
    the difficulty. This stand is called the Rumble Challenge.'

- en: 'At first glance, the timed challenge may seem pretty easy: you need to pick
    just one lock, and usually it’s not even a high-security model. However, several
    factors make this challenge unique.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First is the stand itself. Having the lock mounted to a board can be a surprising
    twist for locksporters who typically hold their locks or mount them in a vise
    at an angle that suits them. Since picking in this position might feel awkward
    to you, consider practicing on a lock mounted on a vertical surface before entering
    this competition. You might also want to ask the judge if you’re allowed to move
    the stand before you start; placing it on your lap might be more comfortable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, unlike most locksport picking competitions, in this event it matters
    which direction you turn the plug. Unlocking the deadbolt requires retracting
    the bolt, meaning the plug needs to rotate away from the bolt. Whether this means
    you need to turn the plug clockwise or counterclockwise depends on which way the
    lock is mounted. For the stand in [Figure A-2](app01.xhtml#app01fig2), you’d need
    to turn the plug counterclockwise to open it. Many contestants miss this detail
    and waste valuable time picking the lock in the wrong direction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Third, rules about placing tension wrenches in the lock before you start picking
    can vary from event to event. Positioning the wrench ahead of time can save you
    valuable seconds, so be sure to ask the judge before the round starts whether
    this is allowed. If it isn’t, ask if you can at least test various turning tools
    first to see which fits best.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fourth, going head-to-head with other people can be intimidating, especially
    when a timer is running. Try to focus on the lockpicking, not on the timer or
    on anyone else’s progress. Also try to ignore any spectators, as this type of
    contest is quite visual and can sometimes draw a crowd. If you’re easily distracted
    by other people, consider trying to find a lull in the crowd sometime during the
    event and play then. In lockpick villages at large events, lunch breaks and breaks
    between talks are usually busy times and best avoided by those who suffer under
    pressure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, check the rules for do-overs. Some competitions allow you to retry
    the contest only a set number of times, if at all. Others may take your best time
    during the event, or they might average all of your times. Based on the rules,
    decide whether you’re likely to improve your time by trying the contest more than
    once. However, be considerate of other competitors and the judges’ time. Even
    if retries aren’t limited, having one contestant keep trying the contest continually
    throughout an event can be annoying, especially if judges are overseeing multiple
    events.

    easy. Matt published the code needed to run the timer on a Raspberry Pi on GitHub
    at *[https://github.com/mburrough/locktimer](https://github.com/mburrough/locktimer)*,
    so building a set is mainly a woodworking project. Here we’ll list the materials
    to build four stands, but feel free to adjust up or down depending on your needs.
    Since this design uses US-style deadbolt locks, we’re also specifying the materials
    in imperial units. Materials in metric equivalents should work just as well. If
    you’re looking to build only one set for home practice, just quarter the material
    quantities.

    board into four 12" lengths. The longer 2"×6" pieces will act as the door to which
    you’ll mount the deadbolt. The 2"×4" pieces will be the door frame where the bolt

    to install the lock. Make sure all your holes are aligned and the lock is working

    to adjust the tightness of the screws if the lock isn’t working smoothly. Extend
    (lock) the bolt by using the key.

    Luckily, the friendly folks at FoxPick have offered several suggestions for competitors.
    First, as with the head-to-head challenge, players should practice picking locks
    mounted on boards. Since the PicTacToe board is even larger than the head-to-head
    lock stands, players won’t be able to make significant adjustments to the position
    or angle of the locks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, the locks in PicTacToe aren’t all the same. The center lock is the hardest,
    the corners are medium difficulty, and the four remaining locks are the easiest.
    Having a strategy for which lock to target first and which row/column/diagonal
    you plan to pick before starting will save you time during the competition.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Third, since rakes aren’t allowed, practice picking using standard hooks. You
    may also want to practice with picks other than your usual set. Since picks are
    provided, it’s best to be comfortable working with one that isn’t your favorite.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, this is a player-versus-player contest, so it’s a good idea to practice
    picking under pressure against someone. Also consider whether you’ll just go for
    the locks you need to open or also try to block your opponent by targeting a lock
    in the row they’ve selected.

    on a phone or duffel bag. As in the timed lockpicking challenge, the only real
    hurdles are picking the locks at a potentially uncomfortable angle and making

    locking mechanisms throughout their history. That said, in many countries, the
    most common handcuffs are ratcheting cuffs that go on the wrists and are connected
    by a couple of chain links, like those in [Figure A-11](app01.xhtml#app01fig11).
    These are manufactured by companies such as Peerless Handcuff Company, ASP, and
    Smith & Wesson.

    open on a riveted hinge point and has a series of teeth on the end. This part,
    called the *single strand*, is functionally equivalent to the shackle of a padlock.
    These teeth of the single strand interact with a *pawl* inside the handcuff’s
    housing, which is a spring-loaded piece of metal with a few teeth of its own and
    is similar to the latch found in a padlock (see [Figure A-12](app01.xhtml#app01fig12)).
    The locking mechanism for these cuffs is essentially a warded lock. A small protrusion
    on the key depresses the tip of the pawl, retracting it from the single strand’s
    teeth, to unlock the cuffs.'

    pull on the single strand to get it to open. [Figure A-13](app01.xhtml#app01fig13)

    This not only prevents shimming but also serves as a safety feature for the handcuffed
    person; the cuffs can’t be tightened further when double locked, so they won’t
    accidentally constrict the person’s wrist. To unlock a double-locked handcuff,
    you must turn the handcuff key in one direction first to release the double lock,
    then in the opposite direction to lower the pawl.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The wafer locks used on filing cabinets, phone-dial locks, and even vehicles
    may also be unfamiliar to you from a locksport perspective. Wafer locks are similar
    to pin tumbler locks in that they contain several blocking elements that need
    to be lifted to the correct height to allow the plug to rotate, so it’s possible
    to approach picking them as you would a pin tumbler lock. However, you should
    be aware of a few tricks and gotchas when you’re dealing with wafers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, wafers are flat plates, not round cylinders like pins. They have no shear
    line, but if you lift them too high, they’ll block at the top of the plug rather
    than catching at the bottom. Particularly sharp or aggressively used rakes can
    then catch on the wafers, potentially damaging them, the small springs used to
    hold them, or even the rake itself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Second, wafers can come from both the top and bottom of the keyway, so on some
    locks you’ll need to move some wafers upward and some downward. For this reason,
    *ball-end* and *double-ball* picks (also called *snowman* picks), shown in [Figure
    A-17](app01.xhtml#app01fig17), are popular choices for wafer locks. While these
    picks are often scorned in pin tumbler picking, their gentle curves and double-sidedness
    do well on wafers. Having said that, regular hooks and rakes will also work on
    wafer locks.

    three to five wafers is the norm. Additionally, their tolerances are often poor,
    meaning the wafers aren’t precisely set to the correct standardized height. Taken
    together, these two traits mean that key-shaped objects might well open such a
    lock. Enter the *wafer jiggler* set: thin pieces of metal cut into shapes that
    look vaguely key-like, as you can see in [Figure A-18](app01.xhtml#app01fig18).
    By inserting these in the lock (one at a time) and using rocking, raking, or jiggling
    motions, you have a good chance of opening the lock. You can purchase jigglers
    from many of the same sellers as regular lock picks.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another method of opening wafer locks involves using a flat piece of metal,
    like the handle of a pick or an uncut key that fits the keyway. Insert the object
    all the way into the keyway, using it both to lift all the wafers and to apply
    slight rotational pressure on the plug. Then, while still applying turning pressure,
    slowly pull out the object. Because of the lateral pressure, the wafers may bind
    on the lock housing as they drop, allowing the plug to rotate. This can take some
    practice and may not work on higher-quality locks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'If all these methods fail, simply try single-pin picking the wafers or raking
    with your least aggressively shaped rake. One final word of caution: some wafer
    plugs are held in their housing by the rearmost wafer in the lock, which is usually
    spaced a bit farther away from the other wafers. If you pick this wafer, which
    is especially likely if you’re raking the lock, the entire plug will come out
    of the lock. This feature allows a special key to remove the plug to make rekeying
    easy. If this happens, you might still be able to open the lock by reaching a
    tool into the back of the housing and rotating the cam or manipulating the latch
    directly. To reinstall the plug, depress the wafers so they’re flush with the
    plug and slip the plug back into the housing.'

    code wheels, like the one shown in [Figure A-19](app01.xhtml#app01fig19). Each
    code wheel has one gate through which the teeth can pass, so when all the gates
    are aligned, all the teeth can pass and the lock opens. The better locks include
    one or two smaller false gates that the teeth can’t fit through to make it harder
    to find the true gate.

    Pulling on the shackle will cause one or more of the wheels to tilt or jam against

    is binding (it will be the most difficult wheel to turn), and rotate it until
    it is free, or loose, or wobbly. Often the shackle will come out a little too.
    Now locate the next wheel that’s binding and repeat the process until the lock

    if you haven’t mastered differentiating false and true gates, you’ll find that
    once all the positions are set on a gate, you can easily tell which wheel is in
    a false gate, as it will start to bind again. Often there’s only one false gate
    per wheel, which is usually directly opposite the true gate. Sometimes, however,
    two or four false gates are located at fixed intervals all the way around.

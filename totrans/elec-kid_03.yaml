    each other at their opposite poles. Now, try to force two of the same poles toward
    each other. That’s harder, isn’t it? Opposite poles are attracted to each other,

    wire on one side to make it non-conductive. Draw your line so that the rotor disconnects
    from the battery when the loop lies horizontally above the magnet.

    the positive and negative terminals.

    You might need to give it a little push. It won’t run any cars, but if it works,
    then you definitely just made something move with electricity. Congratulations!

    not the part you covered with the marker—touching the exposed wire of the U-shaped
    structure. That way, when you connect the battery, the coil becomes magnetic.

    rotor spins better in one direction than the other, so try to connect the battery
    the other way around to see what’s best for your motor.

    all the way around the loop. Try unwinding a few loops to make the coil lighter.

    should be as centered as possible.

    started. Try tapping it lightly with your finger to see whether that unleashes
    a speed demon.

- en: In this chapter, you’ve learned that magnets can be created by winding a wire
    around a bolt and connecting it to a battery, and you’ve tested this by building
    your own electromagnet. At the end, you learned how electric motors work, and
    you even built one for yourself. You really got things moving!

- en: Now, take that knowledge and explore electricity a little further. Try adding
    even more magnets under the rotor of your motor. Then, wind a rotor coil that
    is twice as big or even bigger. You can create a much larger structure for the
    motor. How fast can you make your motor go?

    In the next chapter, you’ll learn a couple of different ways to generate electricity,
    and you’ll be playing around a bit more with magnets.

    day on the Android team. Not far from my desk were at least a half-dozen machines
    for brewing a wide variety of great, strong coffee. I was surprised at the focus
    on caffeine, but not for long.

    work on the next one^([2](#f08-footnote-5)) in parallel. Both were difficult,
    time-consuming, and critical as we tried to make Android relevant in the crowded
    smartphone market at that time. There was a constant feeling of racing furiously
    toward a goal, doing whatever we could to reach it and not knowing if we would.
    The pace was frantic, but the work was exhilarating—and not just because of the
    caffeine. The excitement came from being on a team singularly dedicated to its
    purpose, no matter how much effort it took.

    much-needed skills to new projects, to tackle unknown problems and deliver innovative

    worked with (and authored a book with^([4](#f08-footnote-7))) when he was an intern
    at Sun in 2005, had a problem. He had joined the Android team in 2007 and was
    too busy to write the animation system that he knew was needed. But he knew me,
    and he knew that that’s the kind of project I love. Several interviews and five
    months later, I joined Android’s UI toolkit team in building 44 on the Google
    campus in Mountain View and started working harder than I ever had before.

    use my software, because the reality was that they’d never see the results of

    faced an uphill battle to get it to its initial 1.0 release.

    everything from the low-level kernel and hardware drivers to the overall platform
    software. It also entailed creating APIs for applications, tools to help build
    those applications, several applications to bundle with the platform, and services
    on the backend for those applications to communicate with. Oh, and they wanted
    to ship all of this with a new phone as well.

- en: The software would be provided to manufacturers for free to build their own
    phones. These partners would build the hardware and Android would provide the
    software. The OS would help phone manufacturers by allowing them to focus on their
    hardware products, leaving the increasingly complex software problem up to Android.
    At the same time, Android would help application developers by creating a uniform
    platform across a variety of phones. Developers would be able to write a single
    version of their app for all of these devices, instead of requiring different
    versions for different devices.

    years, the atmosphere within Android was that of an underdog, constantly on the
    brink of failure and having to work incredibly hard to eke out every inch of progress.
    Success was far from a foregone conclusion. We were a year behind. Had we slipped
    into the next year, we might have been a historic footnote rather than a viable
    alternative.”

    a couple tips for reading it, to make the organization of this large topic a bit
    clearer.
  prefs: []

- en: First, a note on the word *Android*. One of the things that had my editor tearing
    her hair out was my frequent use of the word *Android* to mean anything from the
    startup company, to the team after it was acquired by Google, to the software
    platform being built, to the phone product, to the open source code, to someone’s
    nickname.

    the things that happened and the people who did those things in a time-flows-forward
    fashion, because time is a helpful way to organize complex, interrelated things.
    However, it is impossible to actually tell the story in a strictly chronological
    way because so many things happened in parallel. So you’ll notice that the story
    may follow what someone worked on through 1.0 or beyond, and then the timeline
    might rewind to tell the story of someone else on the team.
  prefs: []

- en: Speaking of time, the book’s story begins with the founding of Android and continues
    until late 2009\. Most of it takes place in the time leading up to the 1.0 launch,^([12](#f08-footnote-15))
    in late 2008\. By 1.0, most of the pieces that enabled Android’s future were already
    in place. The timeline stretches out another year, to the end of 2009, which is
    when the first glimpse of Android’s future success was visible, after the launch
    of the Motorola Droid in the US.

    hardware engineers who know (and, let’s face it, might actually care) about the
    technical details. I try hard to avoid the too-technical weeds, in the interest
    of not losing people along the way. But it’s impossible to describe how an OS
    was built without using terms like “OS” that may be unfamiliar to people who don’t
    happen to write code for a living. I try to define the terms as I go,^([13](#f08-footnote-16))
    but if you get stuck on a passage wondering what *APIs* are again, or what I mean
    by *CL*, check out the “Jargon” section in the appendix.

    that early team, starting with a recorded lunchtime chat^([15](#f08-footnote-18))
    with Dianne Hackborn and Romain Guy. I continued from there, interviewing (mostly
    in person, though sometimes over email) most of the people on the early team over

    As I did this, spending a lot of quality time listening to, transcribing, and
    reading these conversations, I realized a beautiful thing: the conversations weren’t
    just research for the book; they *were* the book. I had intended to use the interviews
    as background to help me understand the big picture, the chronology, and some
    of the details that I wouldn’t have discovered otherwise. But what I didn’t anticipate
    was how well everyone was going to tell the story, in their own words.'

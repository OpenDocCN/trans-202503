    time-consuming, and critical as we tried to make Android relevant in the crowded
    smartphone market at that time. There was a constant feeling of racing furiously
    toward a goal, doing whatever we could to reach it and not knowing if we would.
    The pace was frantic, but the work was exhilarating—and not just because of the
    caffeine. The excitement came from being on a team singularly dedicated to its

    the things that happened and the people who did those things in a time-flows-forward
    fashion, because time is a helpful way to organize complex, interrelated things.
    However, it is impossible to actually tell the story in a strictly chronological
    way because so many things happened in parallel. So you’ll notice that the story
    may follow what someone worked on through 1.0 or beyond, and then the timeline
    might rewind to tell the story of someone else on the team.

  zh: 其次，故事是按时间顺序讲述的…大致如此。也就是说，我按照时间的流动顺序描述发生的事情以及做这些事情的人，因为时间是组织复杂互相关联事物的有力工具。然而，由于许多事情是并行发生的，所以实际上不可能严格按时间顺序讲述这个故事。所以，你会注意到，故事可能会跟随某人在1.0版本或之后的工作进展，然后时间线可能会倒回，讲述团队中另一个人的故事。

    until late 2009\. Most of it takes place in the time leading up to the 1.0 launch,^([12](#f08-footnote-15))
    in late 2008\. By 1.0, most of the pieces that enabled Android’s future were already

- en: Finally, I want this book to be readable by everyone, not just software and
    hardware engineers who know (and, let’s face it, might actually care) about the
    technical details. I try hard to avoid the too-technical weeds, in the interest
    of not losing people along the way. But it’s impossible to describe how an OS
    was built without using terms like “OS” that may be unfamiliar to people who don’t
    happen to write code for a living. I try to define the terms as I go,^([13](#f08-footnote-16))

  zh: 我花了很多时间进行这些对话。然后，因为书面文字比音频录音更容易查阅和搜索，我花了更多的时间将对话转录成文字文件^([17](#f08-footnote-20))。在这个过程中，我花了很多高质量的时间去聆听、转录和阅读这些对话，我意识到一件美妙的事情：这些对话不仅仅是书籍的研究资料；它们*就是*这本书。我原本打算将访谈作为背景材料，帮助我理解大局、时间线和一些我原本无法发现的细节。但我没有预料到的是，每个人都将如何用他们自己的话讲述这个故事。
- en: I use a lot of quotes from these interviews in this book. In fact, I use quotes
    instead of my description wherever I can, because the story is best told from
    the point of view of people who were there, each in their own voice and with their
    own unique take on the events.

<p class="noindent">Chaos erupted on the deck as the thugs danced away from the wash of pickling juices and sliding eels. A second barrel landed a moment later, sending out a fresh wave. The eels, Deepwater Longbacks by the look of them, measured around four feet from end to end and threatened to trip and tangle, not to mention disgust. A group of three thugs fell into a heap as they tried to escape the splash zone.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank jumped to his feet, grabbed Notation’s arm, and yanked her up.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“What’s going on?” she shouted as a third barrel sailed over their heads and hit the railing.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“No idea,” said Frank. “But now’s our chance. This way!”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">He pulled Notation toward the railing at the ship’s edge, sliding through the puddles of pickling juices and piles of eels. A fourth barrel hit the deck and sent the thugs scurrying again. The deck was beginning to look like a grotesque bowl heaped with long, pale gray noodles.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Alongside the ship bobbed a small, nondescript, but oddly familiar schooner loaded with more barrels. A teenage boy, dressed in wizard’s robes, was rolling a new barrel onto a contraption composed of planks.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_58"/><img src="../images/f0058-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">“We should jump for it,” said Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Jump,” agreed Frank, eyeing the other ship. He didn’t recognize the boy but figured that he must be an enemy of the Vinettees. Nobody in their right mind would fling pickled eels at the Vinettees unless they were already at war. Then again, very few people in their right mind would chose eels as a weapon under any circumstance.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notation nodded, pulled herself onto the railing, and jumped without hesitation. She sailed through the air, clearing the gap easily, and landed on the schooner’s deck.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank pulled himself up onto the railing, muttered a handful of Boolean curse words, and hesitated again as he balanced on the wooden beam. Then, after counting to three a few times, he jumped. Frank missed the schooner by two feet and plunged into the freezing water. He surfaced in time to see another barrel soar overhead. He paused briefly to wonder if the boy was still flinging eels or whether he had moved onto something else—soft cheeses, perhaps.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notation reached down and pulled him onto the ship. He got to his feet and began wringing out his cloak while he assessed their <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_59"/>new situation. The teenager was continuing his barrage of the <em>Retry Loop</em>. Sailors hurried around the deck, pushing the smaller ship away from the <em>Retry Loop</em> with long wooden poles.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Mavis?” Frank called loudly. “I know you’re here somewhere.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Mavis appeared a second later from the hold. “He paid for the cargo,” she said, pointing at the teenager. “It’s up to him how he wants to unload it.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I thought you couldn’t—”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Mavis waved him off. “I owed the Vinettees one anyway,” she explained. “Last month they stole one of my caches—17 bushels of carrots!”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank stared at her in amazement. Going against the Vinettees was dangerous business. A hundred bushels of carrots wouldn’t be close to worth it.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Don’t look at me like that, Frank,” she said. “I’m not doing this out of the goodness of my heart. It’s a paid contract. Simple as that. Socks made it worth my while.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Socks?” asked Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Socks?” asked Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Mavis motioned toward the boy, then shrugged. “That’s what he called himself. In my business, you don’t press for real names.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“You didn’t ask for official identification before letting him board?” asked Notation. Mavis gave her a skeptical look.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">By now, Mavis’s crew had gotten the <em>TCP Flyer</em> turned around, and they were heading out to sea. Dirty sails were hoisted into the air, blocking Socks’s barrel throwing. He took a last long look at the <em>Retry Loop</em>, smiled, and turned finally to Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Hi,” he said with all too much cheerfulness, “I’m Socks.” He held out his hand. Frank shook it warily.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Thank you for saving us, <em>Socks</em>,” Notation said as she shook his hand too. She eyed him beadily, then, apparently unsatisfied with the subtlety of her approach, followed with, “What’s your real name, Socks?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_60"/>“Unfortunately, that is my real name,” replied Socks a little sadly. “My full name is Socks Repellent, Officer.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Oh . . .” Notation trailed off. Evidently failing to find any suitable consolation for such a misfortune, she repeated, “Thank you for saving us.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Anytime,” replied Socks. “I didn’t have any experience flinging barrels, so I’m glad it worked.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Why did you help us, Socks?” Frank asked. “More importantly, how did you know we needed help?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Well,” said Socks. “You see . . . I’ve been following you both all morning.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“The alley on Three Bit Lane?” asked Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Yes,” replied Socks, blushing. “And behind the big ArrayCart in parking space #2.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I missed that one,” Frank admitted.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“His legs were clearly visible by the wheels,” said Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Why were you following me?” asked Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Us,” corrected Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Because we’re after the same people,” said Socks as though it were the most obvious answer in the world.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“We are?” asked Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I think so,” said Socks, suddenly looking uncertain. “You’re investigating one of the police department thefts, right? I saw Captain Donovan visit Frank last night, so I assumed it had something to do with the one at headquarters.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“<em>Thefts</em>?” asked Frank. “There’s been more than one?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Oh,” said Socks. “You didn’t know. Sorry. Maybe I wasn’t supposed to say anything. But I don’t think that was supposed to be secret. I guess—”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Why are the wizards concerned about thefts from police stations?” Frank cut in.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“The king called them in. A few weeks ago, King Fredrick summoned some of the kingdom’s most senior and respected wizards to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_61"/>investigate a theft. I’m Gretchen’s apprentice, of course. It’s only my second year, but—”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Why did he call in senior wizards?” Frank interrupted again. Gretchen wasn’t a name he’d heard before. Evidently, the more powerful wizards had been occupied with more pressing tasks, and the king had worked his way down the list, but Frank didn’t want to embarrass the boy by questioning his mentor’s seniority.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“The Capital Police are well equipped to handle thefts,” added Notation. “It should be their investigation.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“The king called in the wizards to consult about the mask and whether they could find it,” explained Socks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“What mask?” asked Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“You don’t know about the mask?” said Socks, now a little panicked. “Oh, dear. Maybe I shouldn’t have said anything.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“What mask?” growled Frank. He rubbed his temples and took a few deep breaths.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Mr. Repellent,” took up Notation in her official police voice, “we are on an important investigation. If you have information that would help in this case, it is your duty to provide it. Please tell us everything.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Start at the beginning,” added Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">It took 10 minutes for Socks to finish his excessively detailed story concerning a monthlong crime spree in which a multitude of unrelated items were stolen from secure locations. The most disturbing revelation involved the theft of a dangerous magical artifact, an enchanted mask, from a military convoy. When pressed for details on what the mask did or why it needed an armed escort, Socks would only repeat that it was “extremely powerful.” The awe in his voice made Frank nervous.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“You think this theft is related to the one at the police station?” asked Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Gretchen thinks so,” Socks answered. “In every case, the guards were completely unaware that a theft had occurred until <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_62"/>the next day. She thinks the thief used a memory spell or a sleep charm.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I did not fall asleep,” Notation said with such force that even Frank leaned away.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I . . . I didn’t mean,” Socks stammered.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank left him to flail about for words as he pondered the kid’s story. Something about it didn’t add up. “Why tail us?” he asked finally. “You’re on an investigation sanctioned by the king himself, right? You could have just walked up and introduced yourself.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Yes! But . . .” Socks trailed off.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“But?” asked Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I wasn’t sure it would be worthwhile,” admitted Socks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank glared at him until he continued.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I wasn’t sure you were going to find anything interesting,” explained Socks. “Once I introduced myself, I would be obliged to come with you and help out, right? I wanted to keep my options open. What if I heard about a better, magical lead or something? Sorry,” the boy muttered.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">They lapsed into thoughtful silence as the ship’s crew continued to dash around them, doing whatever was needed to make a ship move. As far as Frank could tell, it seemed to primarily involve pulling on ropes.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“So . . . what now?” asked Socks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“We follow leads,” said Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“We found two suspicious ports in the <em>Retry Loop</em>’s logs,” Notation explained. “Our next step is to investigate them, starting with the Port of Mudwall. In fact, I should inform the captain of the ship. Of course, we’ll need to borrow her vessel for the investigation.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank laughed. “Good luck explaining that to Mavis.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“No need,” said Socks hurriedly. “I already paid to contract the ship. You just need to tell Mavis where to sail.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Excellent,” said Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_63"/>“Which means you’re coming with us, doesn’t it?” asked Frank, without trying to conceal the irritation in his voice.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Of course,” said Socks. “I paid for the ship. And I saved you. And I seem to know more about the case than anyone else here. And I’m an apprentice wizard. That could come in handy.” His desperation seemed to increase with every additional reason.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Mr. Repellent, we would be grateful for your assistance,” Notation assured him. “Wouldn’t we, Frank?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Yeah. Great,” mumbled Frank. He had collected yet another tag-along whom he didn’t trust. At this rate, he would have a boatful by nightfall.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_64"/></p>&#13;

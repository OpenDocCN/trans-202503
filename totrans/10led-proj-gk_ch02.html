<p class="ch-sub"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_47"/>In this project, you’ll build a decorative UFO that lights up.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0047-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_48"/>My desk is always covered with half a dozen geeky trinkets—an action figure here, a few old <em>Star Wars</em> collectible cards there, and sometimes a new gadget with no real purpose other than to make sounds. Some I keep around for inspiration while writing, and others just add a bit of color and quirkiness to my daily routine. If your desk is lacking in unnecessary trinkets, liven it up with your own version of the Desktop UFO.</p>
<p class="indent">The Desktop UFO is lit by LEDs that provide a nice eerie glow. It has an on/off switch to save power and takes up very little space. It consists of a mix of 3D-printed components and items you can likely find around the house, as well as a few electronics components. Including 3D printing time, the entire project can be completed by a beginner in six hours or less.</p>
<p class="indent">If you don’t have access to a 3D printer, don’t worry. A careful examination of the Desktop UFO reveals some very basic shapes. A plastic saucer of any kind could substitute for the 3D-printed version, and the landing pads can be made from plastic or wood or any small, flat objects that can be drilled. It also might be worth checking local libraries and maker spaces to see if there’s a 3D printer you can use.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev43"><strong>GET THE PARTS</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Here is a list of the tools and components you’ll need to make the Desktop UFO. This project does require some soldering; if you need instructions, see the appendix.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="lev46"><strong>INTRODUCING THE NEOPIXEL</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">In developing the ideas for the UFO, I found that the Adafruit NeoPixel component, shown in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig1">Figure 2-1</a>, offered a nice special effect for the UFO. The NeoPixel is a strip or ring of LEDs that you can program to light up in a pattern, providing a rotating, glowing ring beneath the saucer.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch02fig1"/><img src="../images/f0049-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-1:</strong> The Adafruit NeoPixel</p>
<p class="indent">The NeoPixel will be placed beneath the Desktop UFO, with wires pulled through one or two of the legs, which we’ll make from drinking straws. The battery case and Trinket controller that controls the lights on the NeoPixel will be situated beneath a round plastic lid recovered from a plastic container. The body of the UFO and the landing pads will be created in a CAD application (Tinkercad) and printed on a 3D printer. Let’s get started!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev47"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_50"/><strong>BUILD IT</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">First we’ll set up the Trinket, shown in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig2">Figure 2-2</a>. This is the controller board for the whole project that will tell the LEDs on the NeoPixel how they should behave. Then we’ll prepare the NeoPixel with a battery and put everything together in the UFO body, which we’ll build last.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch02fig2"/><img src="../images/f0050-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-2:</strong> The Trinket board</p>
<p class="indent">When everything is built, we’ll upload a short program, called a <em>sketch</em>, that tells the Trinket the pattern in which to trigger the various LEDs contained in the NeoPixel ring. An LED will light up when voltage is supplied. The NeoPixel provides an “address” for each LED so the sketch can indicate which LEDs the Trinket should provide voltage to at any one time.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev48"><strong>Preparing the Trinket</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Before you can run the sketch that tells the NeoPixel’s LEDs to light up in a particular order, you’ll need to complete these steps to prepare your Trinket:</p>
<ol>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><strong>Install the software on your Trinket.</strong> Connect your Trinket to a desktop computer or laptop with an A-to-MicroB USB cable. (There are many varieties of USB cables; the Trinket uses the MicroB. If you do a quick internet search for USB cable types, you can find more details on how to identify the correct cable.)</p>
<p class="indent">Mac and Linux computers don’t need extra drivers installed, but if you’re using Windows, you’ll need to download the drivers. Go to <em><a href="https://nostarch.com/LEDHandbook/">https://nostarch.com/LEDHandbook/</a></em> and follow the link to the drivers for <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Project 2</a>.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_51"/><strong>Download the <em>adafruit_drivers.exe</em> file.</strong> Run the <em>adafruit_drivers.exe</em> installation file (the filename will also include the latest version number) by double-clicking it, then follow the instructions and click through the steps to install all drivers.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll also need to install the Arduino IDE. See “<a href="intro.xhtml#lev17">Getting Started with the Arduino and the Arduino IDE</a>” on <a href="intro.xhtml#page_15">page 15</a> for instructions. The following two links will be helpful if you get stuck during the IDE or driver installation: <em><a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-trinket/starting-the-bootloader">https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-trinket/starting-the-bootloader</a></em> and <em><a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-trinket/setting-up-with-arduino-ide">https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-trinket/setting-up-with-arduino-ide</a></em>.</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll need to use the Arduino IDE to allow sketches to be uploaded to the Trinket.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><strong>Test the Trinket.</strong> Now we’ll set up the Arduino IDE to communicate with the Trinket and use a simple sketch that’s installed with the Arduino IDE to test out the Trinket. Make sure your Trinket is connected to your computer and open the Arduino IDE. Go to the Tools menu, select <strong>Board</strong>, and from the list select <strong>Adafruit Trinket 8MHz</strong> as the board type. Again in the Tools menu, click <strong>Programmer</strong> and select <strong>USBtinyISP</strong>. Press the red button on the Trinket to prepare it for the sketch upload. Go to <strong>File</strong> <span class="ent">▸</span> <strong>Examples</strong> <span class="ent">▸</span> <strong>01.Basics</strong> <span class="ent">▸</span> <strong>Blink</strong>. A new IDE screen will open up with the Blink sketch, as shown in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch02fig3"/><img src="../images/f0051-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-3:</strong> The Blink sketch in the Arduino IDE</p>
<p class="indent">When the red LED on the Trinket blinks, click the upload button on the Arduino IDE toolbar ( <img src="../images/f0051-02.jpg" alt="image"/> ) to upload the Blink sketch. We’ll upload the sketch for this project shortly, but for now we’re simply checking that our setup is working.</p>
<p class="indent">The red LED on your Trinket should blink over and over. That means it’s working! If you don’t see the light blinking, try <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_52"/>uploading the sketch again, making sure your Trinket is fully connected to the computer.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><strong>Upload the NeoPixel sketch.</strong> Our code for controlling the NeoPixel is based on a sketch from Adafruit (<em><a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/kaleidoscope-eyes-neopixel-led-goggles-trinket-gemma/software">https://learn.adafruit.com/kaleidoscope-eyes-neopixel-led-goggles-trinket-gemma/software</a></em>), with one small change. On this line from the original:</p>
<pre>for(i=0; i&lt;16; i++) {</pre>
<p class="noindent">we changed the 16 to 24 so the line reads:</p>
<pre>for(i=0; i&lt;24; i++) {</pre>
<p class="indent">The customized sketch, <em>UFO.ino</em>, is available in the book’s resources at <em><a href="https://nostarch.com/LEDHandbook/">https://nostarch.com/LEDHandbook/</a></em>. Download the file and save it. You’ll also need to save the NeoPixel library in your libraries folder. This is also available in the book’s resources.</p>
<p class="indent">Upload <em>UFO.ino</em> into your Arduino IDE by going to <strong>File</strong> <span class="ent">▸</span> <strong>Open</strong> and finding the file. This code will cause the NeoPixel to display a number of random animations. If you’re good with programming, you can modify the code to do any type of animation you like.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong>NOTE</strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>Programmers who want to edit their code can use hex code</em> <span class="codeitalic">0xff0000</span> <em>for red,</em> <span class="codeitalic">0x0000ff</span> <em>for blue, and</em> <span class="codeitalic">0x00ff00</span> <em>for green.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Once you’ve uploaded the Adafruit NeoPixel sketch to your Trinket, it’s time to add the wiring.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev49"><strong>Wiring the Electronics</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Next, it’s time to wire up and test the electronics before we move to the design of the UFO body.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong>NOTE</strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>See the appendix for soldering instructions.</em></p>
</div>
<ol>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><strong>Solder the header pins.</strong> The Trinket comes unassembled and requires a little bit of soldering. Included with the Trinket are headers that can be broken apart and soldered to the Trinket.</p>
<p class="indent">For this project, we’ll use the following locations on the Trinket:</p>
<ul class="bullet5">
<li class="noindent">BAT</li>
<li class="noindent">5V</li>
<li class="noindent">#0</li>
<li class="noindent">GND</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Solder headers to the Trinket at these locations. You may want to solder additional headers as well, as shown in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_53"/><a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>. If you want to add more features to the Trinket later, this will save you from having to solder again.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong>NOTE</strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>As an alternative to using headers, you can solder four strands of 8-inch wire directly to the small copper-plated holes labeled BAT, 5V, #0, and GND drilled into the Trinket.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="image"><a id="ch02fig4"/><img src="../images/f0053-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-4:</strong> Solder headers to the Trinket.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><strong>Solder wires to the NeoPixel.</strong> Next, solder connections to the NeoPixel for the following locations:</p>
<ul class="bullet5">
<li class="noindent">PWR +5V (there are two; either one will work)</li>
<li class="noindent">GND (there are two; either one will work)</li>
<li class="noindent">Data Input</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">You can use three headers for this, but I found that using three 8-inch lengths of wire works best, as shown in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>. Note that the wires have been inserted up through the holes from the LED side and soldered directly to the small copper rings on the back (black) side of the NeoPixel. It’s common convention to use red wires for the power connection and black for GND (ground).</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch02fig5"/><img src="../images/f0053-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-5:</strong> Solder wires onto the NeoPixel ring.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong>NOTE</strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>This step will be much easier if you cut off two female jumper wire ends and solder them onto the red and black wires of the battery case to extend those wires.</em></p>
</div></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_54"/><strong>Solder the plug.</strong> Next, take your battery case, cut off the white plug on the end, and strip approximately 1/4 inch from the ends of the red and black wires.</p>
<p class="indent">The red wire will provide power to the Trinket, and we’ll connect it to the BAT header in a moment. The black wire will not connect directly to the Trinket; instead, the GND header on the NeoPixel and the black wire from the battery case must share the GND header on the Trinket. To make this possible, take the three headers you set aside earlier and apply some solder to all three pins on one side to create a common connection that you can attach three wires to, as shown in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch02fig6"/><img src="../images/f0054-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-6:</strong> Create a small shared connection with headers.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><strong>Connect up the parts.</strong> Once all the headers have been prepared, make the following connections using the wires you soldered in step 2, or female jumper wires where indicated (see <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>):</p>
<ul class="bullet5">
<li class="noindent">NeoPixel Data Input to #0 on the Trinket</li>
<li class="noindent">NeoPixel PWR +5V to the 5V header on the Trinket</li>
<li class="noindent">NeoPixel GND to one of the three common connection headers</li>
<li class="noindent">Battery case red wire to the BAT header on the Trinket</li>
<li class="noindent">Battery case black wire to one of the three common connection headers</li>
<li class="noindent">GND on the Trinket to one of the three common connection headers via female jumper wire</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">You can add some heat shrink to cover the solder joints if you have it; if not, simple electrical tape will work fine.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_55"/><a id="ch02fig7"/><img src="../images/f0055-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-7:</strong> All the components wired up for testing</p>
<p class="indent">Once all the connections are made, place batteries in the battery box and move the switch to the on position. If the NeoPixel sketch was properly loaded on the Trinket and the wiring is correct, you’ll see a random mix of animations and colors displayed on the NeoPixel.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev50"><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">If you’re not seeing any animation, double-check all the wiring connections first. The small three-header common connection is a frequent culprit, so make sure all wires have a good connection.</p>
<p class="indent">If the wiring is good, connect the Trinket to your computer and upload the sketch again; you do not have to disconnect all the wires to the Trinket when uploading future sketches. You could also upload the Blink sketch again and use it to test that the Trinket is functioning properly.</p>
<p class="indent">Once you’ve got a working NeoPixel displaying the colorful animation, it’s time to move on to the UFO body components.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev51"><strong>Creating the UFO Body and Landing Pads</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Creating a custom UFO body can take some time, so I’ve included the 3D printer files I used for the UFO body and landing pads with the book’s resources at <em><a href="https://nostarch.com/LEDHandbook/">https://nostarch.com/LEDHandbook/</a></em>. You can easily modify these or create your own if you’re comfortable with CAD software.</p>
<p class="indent">The UFO body is printed as a single piece. It will be hollow underneath, and this is where the NeoPixel ring will be placed. There will also <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_56"/>be three holes in the body where three straws will be inserted to act as legs.</p>
<p class="indentb">The body of the UFO was created in Tinkercad (<em><a href="http://www.tinkercad.com">http://www.tinkercad.com</a></em>), as shown in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>. It was based on measurements taken from the NeoPixel Ring as well as the diameter of the drinking straws and the base. I also measured the plastic dome so I could add a suitable space for it on top of the UFO body. The measurements are:</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>NeoPixel</strong> 6.5 cm outer diameter, 5.3 cm inner diameter</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Drinking straw</strong> 0.5 cm outer diameter</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Plastic dome</strong> 2.9 cm outer diameter</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong>Base</strong> 12 cm diameter</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch02fig8"/><img src="../images/f0056-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-8:</strong> The UFO body design in Tinkercad</p>
<p class="indent">The base for the project is nothing more than a round lid from a large plastic container. You’ll need to make sure the lid is at least 1.5 cm tall and large enough to store the battery case beneath without making the entire structure wobble. Remember that the wires will be inserted up through the base and through the straws so they are hidden from view.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ll also need three small landing pads with holes through the center to run the wires from the Trinket and battery box up through the straws and into the UFO body. <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig9">Figure 2-9</a> shows the final design of the landing pads, which can also be created with a 3D printer.</p>

<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-10:</strong> The 3D-printed UFO body</p>
<p class="indent">With the electronics ready and the UFO body, landing pads, and base collected, there are just a few final steps to perform before your UFO is ready to go.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev52"><strong>ASSEMBLE IT</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">We’ll assemble the Desktop UFO in stages. I recommend reading through this entire section before beginning the assembly so you’ll understand the process and how the parts fit together.</p>
<ol>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><strong>Attach the battery box.</strong> Drill a hole in the base of the UFO (the plastic lid) with a 3/8-inch bit, so that the on/off switch on the battery box is accessible. You can use a location of your own choosing, but I elected to drill the hole near the edge of the base, as shown in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig11">Figure 2-11</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_58"/><a id="ch02fig11"/><img src="../images/f0058-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-11:</strong> Hole for accessing the on/off switch</p>
<p class="indent">Position the battery box so you’ll be able to change out the batteries. Before gluing, make sure the on/off switch is aligned with the hole you drilled for it. Apply a small bit of hot glue to the back of the battery box and attach it to the bottom of the base. <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig12">Figure 2-12</a> shows the battery box glued in place.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch02fig12"/><img src="../images/f0058-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-12:</strong> Hot-glue the battery box to the bottom of the base.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the glue has dried, flip the base over and ensure that you can move the on/off switch through the drilled hole as shown in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig13">Figure 2-13</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_59"/><a id="ch02fig13"/><img src="../images/f0059-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-13:</strong> The on/off switch should be accessible.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><strong>Attach the NeoPixel.</strong> Next, use two small dabs of hot glue to secure the NeoPixel to the underside of the UFO body. <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig14">Figure 2-14</a> shows that I’ve used hot glue on opposite sides of the NeoPixel; if you let the hot glue cool for just a few seconds before placing it into the body, it shouldn’t damage the NeoPixel and will allow you to center it under the UFO body.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch02fig14"/><img src="../images/f0059-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-14:</strong> Hot-glue the NeoPixel ring beneath the UFO body.</p>
<p class="indent">Use blue painter’s tape to keep the three wires together at the edge of the body. You should also use small bits of tape to label each of the wires from the NeoPixel (GND, PWR +5V, and Data Input).</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_60"/><strong>Prepare the landing pads.</strong> Place a bit of hot glue around the bendable portion of each drinking straw and insert the short, flexible end into each landing pad as shown in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig15">Figure 2-15</a>. Don’t insert the straw into the hole too far; just enough for the glue to adhere the straw to the landing pad is sufficient. There should be a little bit of the flexible portion of the straw visible above each landing pad.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch02fig15"/><img src="../images/f0060-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-15:</strong> Hot-glue the flexible section of each straw to a landing pad.</p>
<p class="indent">When you’ve finished gluing the flexible ends into the landing pads, cut off about 3 inches from the longer length of each straw; you can fine-tune the length once you get the UFO assembled, but 3 inches or more should give you enough straw to experiment with as you balance the saucer on the legs.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><strong>Secure the Trinket and drill the hole for the landing pad.</strong> The Trinket will need to be secured beneath the base; you can use painter’s tape to temporarily attach it until your Desktop UFO is completed and then secure it with hot glue or stronger tape.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig16">Figure 2-16</a> shows that I’ve secured the Trinket and organized the wires so they are close to the location where I will drill a hole for one of the landing pads.</p>
<p class="indent">You only need to drill a hole under one of the landing pads. That hole can also be drilled with a 3/8-inch drill bit (and you can drill it when you drill the on/off hole described earlier). The flexible <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_61"/>straws will allow you to bend the legs, so you don’t have to be exact with where you drill this hole, but try to imagine an equilateral triangle where the landing pads will be glued beneath the UFO body and drill a hole for the landing pad that will be farthest from the battery box on/off switch.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch02fig16"/><img src="../images/f0061-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-16:</strong> The Trinket is secured and the wires bundled together.</p>
<p class="indent">You will have to disconnect some wires to feed through the straws; <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig17">Figure 2-17</a> shows the hole drilled for one of the landing pads and the wires from the Trinket pulled through.</p>

<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-17:</strong> Landing pad hole and wires from the Trinket</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_62"/><strong>Connect the wires from the Trinket to the NeoPixel.</strong> Using one of the legs you made with the landing pad and straw, insert all three wires from the Trinket so the ends come through the straw. If the straw is too long, trim it down until all three wire ends can be easily connected to the NeoPixel wires as shown in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig18">Figure 2-18</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch02fig18"/><img src="../images/f0062-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-18:</strong> Trinket wires connected to NeoPixel wires</p>
<p class="indent">Remember, connect the 5V wire from the Trinket to the PWR +5V wire on the NeoPixel. (In the photo, that wire is red, but your wire color scheme could be different.) The GND wire from the Trinket connects to the GND wire on the NeoPixel, and the #0 wire on the Trinket connects to the Data Input wire on the NeoPixel.</p>
<p class="indent">After all the wires are connected, flip the on/off switch and test that the NeoPixel still displays animation. If not, recheck all your connections against the preceding instructions and turn back to “<a href="ch02.xhtml#lev50">Troubleshooting</a>” on <a href="ch02.xhtml#page_55">page 55</a>.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list"><strong>Glue the landing pads.</strong> Place a small bit of hot glue on the bottom of each landing pad; you may have to trim off more plastic from the straw to get the pad to sit flat on the base. <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig19">Figure 2-19</a> shows all three landing pads glued to the base.</p>
<p class="indent">You can adjust the angle of the landing pads using the flexible sections of the straws. Angle the landing pads so that the UFO body rests on top of the three legs. Place the clear dome on top and turn the switch on. Hopefully you’ll see a nice glow from beneath the UFO!</p>

<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 2-19:</strong> Hot-glue the three landing pads to the base.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">If you’re happy with the animation, you can use some additional hot glue to secure the UFO body to the legs; be careful when turning the base and legs over and ask for a second set of hands to help you get the legs glued in place properly. Tuck away any exposed wire using tape or a dab of hot glue applied to the underside of the UFO body.</p>
<p class="indent">Finish up with some paint (I recommend silver for the UFO body) and you’ll end up with a cool-looking desk sculpture.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev53"><strong>TAKE IT FURTHER</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">This UFO can easily be modified. You could add some weapons or maybe change the shape to something more menacing. You can replace the NeoPixel with some of Adafruit’s other specialty LEDs—there are so many variations, you’re likely to find something that grabs attention.</p>
<p class="indent">Here are some other ideas to upgrade the Desktop UFO:</p>
<ul>
<li class="noindent">Add a pulsing LED beneath the clear dome</li>
<li class="noindent">Add random sound effects</li>
<li class="noindent">Put a toy cow figurine beneath the UFO</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev54"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a lot of ways to embellish the Desktop UFO, and this really is a great project to teach a young student some basics in electricity and programming as well as prototyping. The final UFO doesn’t have to look perfect; this one has its flaws, but it works and looks cool—and that’s good enough for me!</p>

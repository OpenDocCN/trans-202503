<p class="PartIntro">Let me describe a “simple” embedded system. It is a battery-powered processor housed in a pendant worn around someone’s neck. When the end user has an emergency, they press the button and the computer sends a radio signal to a receiver that makes an emergency call.</p>
<p>Sounds simple . . . except you have to send a precise set of pulses to the radio so it will generate the proper signal. The system must periodically check the battery and send battery information to the base station as well, which serves two purposes. First, when the battery starts to get a little low, the alarm company is notified and sends the end user a new pendant. Second, if the base station doesn’t receive a periodic signal, the alarm company knows that something is wrong with the pendant.</p>
<p>This type of program is typical in the embedded world. It’s small, must be precise, and doesn’t use a lot of outside resources.</p>
<p>In this section of the book, you’ll learn about basic C syntax and programming. We also go through in detail what the C compiler does so you can precisely control what your program does. To have this precise control, you need to know what the compiler is doing behind your back.</p>
<p>Embedded programming presents its own unique debugging challenges. Fortunately, tools like the JTAG debugging interface make things easier, but still, debugging an embedded system can be quite difficult.</p>
<p>One of the most basic and common debugging methods is to put <code>printf</code> statements in your code. This is somewhat difficult when doing embedded <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="2" id="Page_2"/>programming, as there’s no place to send printed output. We’ll cover how to use serial I/O to get printed data out of the embedded system for debugging and logging.</p>
<p>And finally, in this part of the book, you’ll learn about interrupt programming. Interrupts allow you to perform I/O efficiently, but they also allow you to create race conditions and other random bugs if not done right. Design is extremely important here because interrupt problems can be quite debug-resistant.</p>
<p>Welcome to the world of embedded programming. Have fun.</p>

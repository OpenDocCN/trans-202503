    *[http://www.nostarch.com/blendermasterclass.htm](http://www.nostarch.com/blendermasterclass.htm)*.
    The files include separate *.blend* files for each project (corresponding to each
    chapter in the book) and each project in its final state at the end of each chapter
    (where relevant). These resources should allow you to look in-depth at the workings
    of each project and to examine how each one takes shape. Also included are the
    textures used for each project, *.blend* files with some useful brushes for sculpting
    and MatCap materials, and a GIMP brush that you can use in your own projects.
    Links to the textures from CGTextures ([http://www.cgtextures.com/](http://www.cgtextures.com/))are
    listed in a text file.

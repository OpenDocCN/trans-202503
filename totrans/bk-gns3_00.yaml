    water. From the beginning I could see it was going to be an invaluable networking
    tool. I’ve used it to get hands-on experience with operating systems such as Cisco
    IOS, Junos OS, and Arista, as well as to pass quite a few network certification
    exams. To this day, I use it on a regular basis to test router configurations
    before deploying real equipment to the field. *The Book of GNS3* is my way of
    sharing this great resource with other networking professionals, like you.

- en: This book is for anyone involved with networking routers, switches, or firewalls.
    Whether you use Cisco, Juniper, Arista, Vyatta, or some other network operating
    system, GNS3 is a great alternative to building physical labs. Unlike labs that
    use physical equipment, GNS3 virtual labs let you create and save unlimited network
    configurations, without having to tear apart an existing lab. This book covers
    all the details to get your projects up and running fast.

    GNS3 on Windows, OS X, and Linux, and it shows you some geeky and fun tricks along
    the way. Whether you’re just getting started or have used GNS3 before, I think
    you’ll find a new appreciation for how much is possible when you have the right
    tool. I don’t cover TCP/IP networking fundamentals, but I do provide plenty of
    examples of how to configure GNS3 devices.'

- en: The most effective way of learning is by doing. That’s why I use a tutorial-based
    approach to creating fully functional multivendor labs using GNS3\. The tutorials
    explain how to build and configure labs using the virtual devices introduced in
    the chapters. I provide examples of configuring Cisco IOS, Junos OS, and Juniper
    vSRX Firefly, and more. You don’t need to be an expert with network operating
    systems because I’ll guide you step-by-step through the configurations. You could
    spend days, or even weeks, searching the Web to figure out how to configure features
    such as connecting to live switches, creating a virtual access server, or connecting
    your virtual labs to the Internet. But there’s no need to do that after you read
    *The Book of GNS3.*

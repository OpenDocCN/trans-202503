Laurie got
to see so many strange places and people that sometimes she forgot she was trying to find her way
back to Hamilton. But her job wasn’t easy.</p><p>Whenever they arrived at an island, Winsome would take a huge bag of letters into town and
deliver them. She would return a few hours later with a new load of letters to take from that island
to somewhere else.</p><p>Laurie’s job was to deliver the “interesting” packages. (Winsome kept using
that word. Laurie didn’t think it meant what Winsome thought it meant.)
“Interesting” customers lived in tall towers in the middle of nowhere, over shaky, scary
bridges, on top of high hills, or on the sides of cliffs. The packages were heavy (and fragile . . .
and expensive), and the directions for their destinations were often bizarre and incomplete. Just to
make it there and back in one piece, Laurie had to be clever about her work.</p><p>Unclear directions were bad enough, but this time, the package Laurie was supposed to deliver
didn’t have a proper address at all. It just said <span class="emphasis"><em>FIRST, FOLLOW THE BYZANTINE
PROCESS.</em></span> Winsome had gone off somewhere, so Laurie couldn’t even ask her for
help.</p><p>“What is the Byzantine Process? I don’t even know what it looks like. How can I
follow it?” she wondered aloud.</p><p>“We’re on the Island of Byzantium,” said Xor, “so the Process must be
the name of the main road. Or a river. Or a road beside the river. It’s only
logical.”</p><p>“You have no idea, do you, Xor?”</p><p>“Sure I do! My stepsister is an Atlasaurus!”</p><p>“What’s an Atlas . . . never mind. I don’t want to know.”</p><p>Where to begin was no mystery, at least. The entrance to Byzantium was blocked by an enormous
stone building. <span class="emphasis"><em>All Deliveries Enter Here</em></span>, a sign read. A long red carpet led
inside to a semantic turnstile with two guards, just like in Symbol. The guards seemed to be in the
middle of an argument.</p><p>“. . . that makes no sense, Anton!”</p><p>“It makes perfect sense, Basil. If you only—”</p><p>“Excuse me,” said Laurie. “I’d like to pass through.”</p><p>“Sorry, miss. For that, you must have a Pass signed by the Junior Officer of the
Watch—” began Anton.</p><p>“—and countersigned by the Senior Officer of the Watch,” Basil
finished.</p><p>“Who are they?” she asked.</p><p>“We are.”</p><p>“Oh, good.”</p><p>“Lieutenant Basil is the Junior Officer of the Watch, and I am the Senior Officer of the
Watch—” said Anton.</p><p>“—but only on even-numbered days,” said Basil. “On odd-numbered days,
I’m the Senior Officer and Lieutenant Anton is the Junior.”</p><p>“What day is it today?”</p><p>“That’s what we were discussing before you interrupted,” Anton said.
“Yesterday was the Thirtieth of Pentember. I think we all agree that thirty is an even number,
and so I was the Senior Officer.”</p><p>“That means today is the Zeroth of Hectember,” said Basil.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The Zeroth of . . . ? Well, everything has to start somewhere</em></span>, Laurie
thought. “So Anton should be Junior today, and Basil should be Senior, right?”</p><p>“It’s not as simple as that, miss!” said Anton.</p><p>“There is the question of whether zero is even or odd,” said Basil.</p><p>“Oh.” Laurie had never thought of zero that way. Now she was curious. “So
which is it? Even or odd?”</p><p>“Zero is even!” said Anton. “It evenly divides by two. Zero divided by two
is zero.”</p><p>“That doesn’t prove a thing,” said Basil. “Zero divided by
<span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> number is zero. More to the point, if zero is even, then Anton would have
two days in a row as Senior Officer, and I won’t stand for that!”</p><p>“Even more to the point,” said Anton, “if zero is odd, then Basil would be
Senior both today and tomorrow, the First of Hectember. I won’t sit still for
<span class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span>!”</p><p>“You see, miss, when it comes to important questions, where you stand depends on where
you sit,” Basil said.</p><p>“But—” Laurie started.</p><p>“Anyway, you need to have your Pass Approval Request Form approved first.”</p><p>“My Pass Approval Request Form? I don’t understand.”</p><p>“Oh, we don’t have the Passes here, of course,” said Basil. “That
would be bad security!”</p><p>“You have to get your Pass Approval Request approved by General Case. If he says you can
pass, then we say you can pass,” said Anton.</p><p>“He’s down the hall to the right,” added Basil. “Now see here, Anton:
If you add two odd numbers together you get an even, right? And zero plus zero is zero. So if zero
is even like you insist, then it must also be odd at the same time . . .”</p><p>Laurie walked down an endless hall until she came to a slightly open door marked
<span class="emphasis"><em>General Constantin Case, Office of Perimeter Security</em></span>. She knocked lightly and
stepped inside the room.</p><p>“Hello, Mister General, sir? I’m looking for a Pass to go through the
gate.”</p><p>“Hmm.” General Case looked up from his papers for a moment. “And what is
your business?”</p><p>“I’m delivering a package.”</p><p>“Hmm. How many fenceposts do I need for 100 feet of fence?”</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>Fenceposts</em></span>, child. I want to put a fencepost every 10 feet for 100
feet of fence. How many do I need?”</p><p>“Uh, 10?”</p><p>“That’s what I thought, too,” he said, “but we’re running short.
I suspect the enemy is stealing them.”</p><p>Laurie had no idea what he was talking about. “I’m sorry to bother you, sir, but
about that Pass . . .”</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00038a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00038"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="figs/web/103fig01.png.jpg"/></div></div><p>“Take this to General Darius down the hall, in the Office of Logistics,” said
Case, handing her a blank Pass Approval Request Form. “If he approves it, I’ll approve
it.”</p><p>“Thank you!” Laurie said brightly.</p><p>“Hmm.” He turned back to his fencepost problem, leaving Laurie to find General
Darius on her own.</p><p>* * *</p><p>General Damien Darius was also busy with a stack of paperwork. Laurie noticed a large map of a
river on his desk; the map was covered in scribbles and arrows.</p><p>“General Darius? I need a Pass,” said Laurie, handing him the Pass Approval
Request Form she’d gotten from Case.</p><p>“Are you here about the mandelbroccoli?”</p><p>“Uh, mandelbroccoli? No, sir.”</p><p>“Then you have information regarding the wolf.”</p><p>“The wolf?”</p><p>“Yes, the wolf,” said Darius. “One of my men is trying to move a wolf, a
goat, and a load of mandelbroccoli across the Concurrent Streams. The boat is only big enough for
him and one other thing.”</p><p>“Can’t he take one at a time?” she asked.</p><p>“No good. If he takes the wolf and leaves the goat alone with the broccoli, she’ll
eat it. If he takes the broccoli and leaves the wolf with the goat, the wolf will eat
<span class="emphasis"><em>her</em></span>.”</p><p>“So take the goat first,” said Laurie, doing a pantomime in her head. “And
then take . . . oh.”</p><p>“Yes. No matter what he takes next, he has the same problem on the other side.”
Darius said.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00039a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00039"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="figs/web/105fig01.png.jpg"/></div></div><p>“That’s terrible news, but I’m actually asking about a Pass,” Laurie
replied.</p><p>“And I don’t have time for civilian chit-chat. Take whatever this is to General
Euripides in the Office of Records,” Darius said, handing back Laurie’s Form. “If
he approves it, I’ll approve it.”</p><p>Down the hall Laurie went.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Euripides had his hands full with a problem of his own. People were crowded around huge record
books lying on tables in the Office of Records. Some people were trying to read long strings of
numbers from the books. Others wanted to <span class="emphasis"><em>write</em></span> new numbers in the books. The
readers and writers were thrashing about, getting in each other’s way. It looked like a fight
could start at any time.</p><p>The General was pacing from table to table, listening to complaints and issuing orders. A
crowd of people followed him around, shouting over one another, trying to get his attention. It
looked like he barely had time to think.</p><p>Laurie pushed and struggled and wiggled her way to the front of the crowd.</p><p>“Sir? General Euripides? Can you help me?”</p><p>“Eh? Oh, another one. Are you a reader or a writer?”</p><p>“I’m not a reader or a writer. I need you to approve—” Laurie began,
but the General had to go break up an argument.</p><p>“Now what was it you wanted? A reader? Which book?” Euripides asked when he came
back.</p><p>“No, sir. I need—Sir? Hello, sir?”</p><p>Euripides was off to another corner of the room. Laurie tried to get his attention again, but
the crowd kept shoving her out of the way.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Laurie sat on the floor in the hallway and put her head on her knees, exhausted and confused.
Mandelbroccoli, fence-posts, Passes, General This, General That . . . where did it all end? She
could still hear the fighting over who got to use what book next.</p><p>“Those people are so rude,” she grumbled.</p><p>“Why can’t they take turns and share?”</p><p>“Maybe nobody taught them how,” Xor said. “My cousin Rex never liked to
share. Of course, he was forty feet tall and had teeth as long as your arm.”</p><p>“Somebody should teach them. It’s not fair.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Xor said. “Hey, aren’t you Somebody?”</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>“Yeah! I’m pretty sure you are Somebody. Otherwise, you’d be Nobody, and
that wouldn’t make sense to Anybody.”</p><p>“But I’m just a kid. No one pays attention to kids.”</p><p>“So? No one pays attention to me, either,” he said.</p><p>“But that’s what you want, right? To be invisible.”</p><p>“Oh. Yeah.”</p><p>“What are we going to do, Xor?”</p><p>“I dunno. Think. You’re good at that.”</p><p>“No, I’m not,” Laurie muttered.</p><p>“Really? Tinker thought you are. Winsome does, too.”</p><p>Laurie put her head down again and sighed. “I’m just her delivery
girl.”</p><p>“No, you’re her <span class="emphasis"><em>interesting</em></span> delivery girl,” Xor
said.</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“So you figure out how to go where other people can’t. Remember when you were
arguing with Ponens and Tollens outside of Symbol? I didn’t think you’d find a way past
them. But you did. Same with that scary old lady Jane.”</p><p>“They never caught us, either,” Laurie smiled a little.</p><p>“Not until Custody grabbed you.”</p><p>“And that’s when Winsome saved—oh.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I can’t go back and tell Winsome that I couldn’t even get past the front
door!”</p><p>“Why not?” Xor asked.</p><p>“I just . . . I can’t. She gave me a job, and I have to do it
myself.”</p><p>So with nothing else she could do, and nowhere else she could go, Laurie started to
think.</p><p>She needed an Approval from Euripides so she could get one from Darius. Then, she needed to
use <span class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> to get an Approval from General Case, and finally, the Form had to be
signed and countersigned by Basil and Anton. There was something familiar about this Byzantine
chaos. Something Hugh Rustic had told her. <span class="emphasis"><em>Think of an answer, and then look for a problem
that fits.</em></span></p><p>Euripides was up to his ears with problems. Everyone wanted to do everything at once. Maybe
she should start there . . .</p><p>* * *</p><p>A half-hour later, Laurie was back in the Office of Records. She didn’t shout, or shove,
or cut in front of anyone. She waited. Eventually one of the books became completely free. Laurie
walked over to it and drew a line on the floor.</p><p>A woman came over to write in the book. Laurie stepped aside and let her work. A few moments
later, a man came up to read from the book.</p><p>“New policy, sir,” said Laurie. “You have to stand on the line until the
first customer is finished.”</p><p>“But I have to look up something on page 1728!”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she said. “General’s Orders. But you’re
next.”</p><p>“Oh. All right, then.” The man stood carefully on the line. Another person came to
read from page 1024.</p><p>“General’s Orders,” said 1728, pointing to the line. “Don’t
worry. You’re right after me.”</p><p>Laurie held the line until the pattern looked like it would keep going on its own. Each new
person would be told to wait by the others already in line. Then she waited for the next book to
open up.</p><p>As the idea spread, people started drawing lines of their own in front of other books. Soon
the whole Records Office was calm and organized. After all, it was General’s Orders.</p><p>Euripides almost couldn’t believe what he was seeing. The readers and writers were
following a simple rule and taking turns! He was glad to have a rest, and he signed Laurie’s
Pass without a second thought.</p><p>* * *</p><p>“General Darius?”</p><p>“You again. I don’t want to hear about anything else until we’ve sorted out
the Broccoli Situation.”</p><p>“I think the mandelbroccoli doesn’t matter, sir,” said Laurie.</p><p>“What? You want the goat to eat it all?”</p><p>“No, I mean the answer is the same even if you had two wolves instead. You can’t
leave the goat alone with anything. If you change your point of view, it’s easy. I
think.”</p><p>“Go on,” said the General.</p><p>Laurie thought a little more, then wrote down her idea. It looked a bit like the algorithms
back at Tinker’s:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Take the goat over to the other side.</strong></span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Come back empty.</strong></span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Take the wolf over, but then <span class="underline">bring back the
goat</span>.</strong></span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Leave the goat and take the mandelbroccoli over.</strong></span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Come back empty.</strong></span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="strong"><strong>And finally, take the goat over again!</strong></span></p></li></ol></div><p>Darius studied Laurie’s idea for a while, his hands moving this way and that as he
thought it through.</p><p>“I believe this will work. The goat won’t like going back and forth so much, but
it’s better than getting eaten,” said Darius. “Now what is it you wanted,
miss?”</p><p>* * *</p><p>At last, Laurie arrived back at the Office of Perimeter Security. “General Case, sir?
General Darius signed my Pass.”</p><p>“Hmm,” Case hmmed, scribbling a signature below Darius’s.</p><p>“Thank you, sir.”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>“Sir? One more thing,” Laurie said.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“I don’t think anyone is stealing your fenceposts. It’s just that you need
<span class="emphasis"><em>eleven</em></span> posts. Like this.”</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00040a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00040"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="figs/web/111fig01.png"/></div></div><p>“Hmm!”</p><p>* * *</p><p>“Welcome back, miss,” said Anton. Laurie handed over the paperwork she’d
collected from the Byzantine Generals.</p><p>“It looks like everything is in order,” said Basil, examining the list of
signatures. “These approvals go all the way to the top!”</p><p>“Have you anything to declare, miss?” asked Anton.</p><p>“Declare?”</p><p>“What Lieutenant Anton means is,” said Basil, “is there anything we should
know about?”</p><p>“Oh. Well, I think Anton is right. Zero is even.”</p><p>“No!” said Basil.</p><p>“Yes. Zero can’t be odd because one is odd, and you can’t have two odd
numbers in a row, right?”</p><p>“Right!” said Anton.</p><p>“I suppose not,” Basil grumped. “But that doesn’t prove it’s
even.”</p><p>“Well, if you add an odd number and an even number together, you always get an odd
number,” said Laurie.</p><p>“Um,” Basil ummed, thinking about it. “One plus two is three, two plus three
is five . . . yes.”</p><p>“So I can prove whether zero is even or odd. Add it to an odd number and see what you
get. Zero plus one is one, and one is odd. So zero must be even,” said Laurie.</p><p>“I’m still not convinced,” said Basil.</p><p>“Okay,” Laurie said. “If you add two <span class="emphasis"><em>even</em></span> numbers
together, you always get an even number, right? Zero plus two is two, which is even. Zero is even
again!”</p><p>“Exactly!” Anton said.</p><p>“Hrmph,” Basil hrmphed. “So zero is even. How do I keep Anton from being
Senior two days in a row?”</p><p>“That’s the easy part,” Laurie said. “The problem is that yesterday,
the Thirtieth, and today, the Zeroth, are both even. Anton was the Senior yesterday. So Basil, you
can be the Senior Officer of the Watch today.”</p><p>“Now hang on a minute—” said Anton.</p><p>“—but only until lunchtime,” said Laurie. “After lunch today, Anton is
Senior. That way it’s fair.”</p><p>“Brilliant!” said Senior Officer Basil. “Junior Officer Anton, sign this
young lady’s Pass!”</p><p>Approved, approved, approved, signed, and countersigned. Laurie was finally through the
turnstile.</p><p>“I’m glad that’s over,” said Xor. “Now, where the heck is that
Byzantine Process?”</p></div></body></html>

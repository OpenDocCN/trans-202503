<h3 id="h2-501928b06-0005">Security Design Review</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">The six stages of a security design review:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li value="1"><em>Study</em> the design and supporting documents to gain a basic understanding of the project.
<ul>
<li>First, read the documentation to get a high-level understanding of the design.</li>
<li>Next, put on your “security hat” and go through it again with a threat-aware mindset.</li>
<li>Take notes, capturing your ideas and observations for future reference.</li>
<li>Flag potential issues for later, but at this stage it’s premature to do much security analysis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li value="2"><em>Inquire</em> about the design and ask clarifying questions about basic threats.
<ul>
<li>Ensure that the design document is clear and complete.</li>
<li>If there are omissions or corrections needed, help get them fixed in the document.</li>
<li>Understand the design enough to be conversant, but not necessarily at an expert level.</li>
<li>Ask members of the team what they worry about most; if they have no security concerns, ask follow-up questions to learn why not.</li>
</ul></li>
<li value="3"><em>Identify</em> the most security-critical parts of the design for closer attention.
<ul>
<li>Examine interfaces, storage, and communications—these will typically be central points of focus.</li>
<li>Work inward from the most exposed attack surfaces toward the most valuable assets, just as determined attackers would.</li>
<li>Evaluate to what degree the design addresses security explicitly.</li>
<li>If needed, point out key protections and get them called out in the design as important features.</li>
</ul></li>
<li value="4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="279" id="Page_279"/><em>Collaborate</em> with the designer(s) to identify risks and discuss mitigations.
<ul>
<li>As a reviewer, provide a security perspective on risks and mitigations where needed.</li>
<li>Consider sketching a scenario illustrating how a security change could pay off down the line to help convince the designer of the need for mitigations.</li>
<li>Offer more than a single solution to a problem when you can, and help the designer see the strengths and weaknesses of these alternatives.</li>
<li>Accept that the designer gets the last word, because they are ultimately responsible for the design.</li>
<li>Document the exchange of ideas, including what will or will not go into the design.</li>
</ul></li>
<li value="5"><em>Write</em> a summary report of findings and recommendations.
<ul>
<li>Organize the report around specific design changes that address security risks.</li>
<li>Spend most of your effort and ink on the highest-priority issues, and proportionally less on lower priorities.</li>
<li>Suggest alternatives and strategies, without attempting to do the designer’s job for them.</li>
<li>Prioritize findings and recommendations, using priority rankings. (Classify points as Must/Ought/Should.)</li>
<li>Focus on security, but feel free to offer separate remarks for the designer’s consideration as well.</li>
</ul></li>
<li value="6"><em>Follow up</em> with subsequent design changes to confirm resolution before signing off.
<ul>
<li>For major security design changes, you might want to collaborate with the designer to ensure that changes are made correctly.</li>
<li>Where opinions differ, the reviewer should include a statement of both positions and the specific recommendations that weren’t followed to flag it as an open issue. </li>
</ul></li>

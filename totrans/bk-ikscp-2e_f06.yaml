- en: This book is about Inkscape, the powerful, open source SVG-based vector graphics
    editor. It describes 1.1, the latest version, released in 2021 after almost two
    decades of development, in great detail, covering all of its features, excluding
    only those that are experimental or incomplete.

- en: The second, perhaps more ambitious goal of this book is to evangelize the vector
    way of creating graphics and share the joy of thinking in vector. Once the exclusive
    domain of professional designers, vector graphics software has become more common
    and accessible. A vector editor is not yet a standard app in the same way a bitmap
    editor (like Photoshop) is, but it's getting there—and Inkscape has been a major
    cause of this shift.

- en: Much of Inkscape's appeal is due to the fact that it's the only fully open source
    and cross-platform professional-level vector editor. But that's not all. Simple
    and accessible at the basic level, Inkscape is also extremely powerful if you
    dig deeper. It is vast and inexhaustibly hackable—from customizable keyboard shortcuts
    ([3.4](c03.xhtml#section3.4)) and a command line language (Appendix [C](b03.xhtml#chC)),
    to powerful chainable path effects ([Chapter 13](c13.xhtml#ch13)), to arbitrarily
    complex vector filters that push the envelope of vector graphics ([Chapter 17](c17.xhtml#ch17)).
    This book swims the Inkscape ocean from shore to shore leaving no island unvisited.

- en: '[Chapter 1](c01.xhtml#ch1) is a high-level description of Inkscape, its capabilities,
    and its place in the world of vector graphics (and, to some extent, computer graphics
    in general). Next, [Chapter 2](c02.xhtml#ch2) gives an absolutely down-to-the-basics
    primer on the first steps in the program (installation, opening, creating objects,
    transforming them, and saving); you can safely skip this chapter if you have ever
    completed even a small Inkscape project.'

- en: The bulk of the book, [Chapters 3](c03.xhtml#ch3) to [19](c19.xhtml#ch19), is
    written to be read more or less in sequence. These chapters present all aspects
    of Inkscape's functionality (objects, transformations, style, paths, text, effects,
    and more) with detailed explanations, illustrations, and practical tips.

- en: The second part of the book (starting from [Chapter 20](c20.xhtml)) contains
    several complete step-by-step tutorials demonstrating real-world uses of Inkscape,
    including an animation, a business card, and a complex illustration of a rose
    in different styles. The book ends with several appendixes that provide reference
    information.

    The previous edition of this book described version 0.47 and was published way
    back in 2009\. Since then, Inkscape has evolved and matured enormously, and this
    new edition brings the book up to date with that development. Here are the major
    features that are new in Inkscape 1.1 compared to 0.47:'

    many years. Version 1.1 brings great improvements in rendering speed and UI responsiveness,
    especially with filters ([Chapter 17](c17.xhtml#ch17)) as OpenMP multithreading
    is now supported for all filters.'

    text made your file non-compliant SVG because Inkscape used an obsoleted draft
    SVG specification for this feature. Now, Inkscape-flowed text is valid SVG and
    displays correctly in all SVG-compliant renderers including web browsers ([Chapter 15](c15.xhtml#ch15)).
    Also, there''s a new option for autowrapping text into a column of unlimited height

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book can be your first introduction into the world of vector graphics.
    You don't need to be a graphics professional to find it useful. You will learn
    some new concepts and terminology, but that should come naturally if you practice
    what you study. Install Inkscape (if you haven't already) and immediately try
    the techniques as you read about them in this book.

- en: Even those who are experienced in using Inkscape or another vector graphics
    program will find enough to chew on in this book. I am writing from two perspectives—that
    of a longtime Inkscape user and that of a developer who has contributed a lot
    of code to it. I hope this dual perspective allows me to see the logic of the
    program's interface and behavior more clearly, and to identify its unique strong
    and weak points (as well as suggest workarounds).

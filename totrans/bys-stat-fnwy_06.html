<div class="image1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/common.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This chapter builds on the ideas behind the binomial distribution from the previous chapter to introduce another probability distribution, the <em>beta distribution</em>. You use the beta distribution to estimate the probability of an event for which you’ve already observed a number of trials and the number of successful outcomes. For example, you would use it to estimate the probability of flipping a heads when so far you have observed 100 tosses of a coin and 40 of those were heads.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">While exploring the beta distribution, we’ll also look at the differences between probability and statistics. Often in probability texts, we are given the probabilities for events explicitly. However, in real life, this is rarely the case. Instead, we are given data, which we use to come up with estimates for probabilities. This is where statistics comes in: it allows us to take data and make estimates about what probabilities we’re dealing with.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_46"/><strong>A Strange Scenario: Getting the Data</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Here’s the scenario for this chapter. One day you walk into a curiosity shop. The owner greets you and, after you browse for a bit, asks if there is anything in particular you’re looking for. You respond that you’d love to see the strangest thing he has to show you. He smiles and pulls something out from behind the counter. You’re handed a black box, about the size of a Rubik’s Cube, that seems impossibly heavy. Intrigued, you ask, “What does it do?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The owner points out a small slit on the top of the box and another on the bottom. “If you put a quarter in the top,” he tells you, “sometimes two come out the bottom!” Excited to try this out, you grab a quarter from your pocket and put it in. You wait and nothing happens. Then the shop owner says, “And sometimes it just eats your quarter. I’ve had this thing a while, and I’ve never seen it run out of quarters or get too full to take more!”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Perplexed by this but eager to make use of your newfound probability skills, you ask, “What’s the probability of getting two quarters?” The owner replies quizzically, “I have no idea. As you can see, it’s just a black box, and there are no instructions. All I know is how it behaves. Sometimes you get two quarters back, and sometimes it eats your quarter.”</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch05lev2sec1"><strong><em>Distinguishing Probability, Statistics, and Inference</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">While this is a somewhat unusual everyday problem, it’s actually an extremely common type of probability problem. In all of the examples so far, outside of the first chapter, we’ve known the probability of all the possible events, or at least how much we’d be willing to bet on them. In real life we are almost never sure what the exact probability of any event is; instead, we just have observations and data.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This is commonly considered the division between probability and statistics. In probability, we know exactly how probable all of our events are, and what we are concerned with is how likely certain observations are. For example, we might be told that there is 1/2 probability of getting heads in a fair coin toss and want to know the probability of getting exactly 7 heads in 20 coin tosses.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In statistics, we would look at this problem backward: assuming you observe 7 heads in 20 coin tosses, what is the probability of getting heads in a single coin toss? As you can see, in this example we don’t know what the probability is. In a sense, statistics is probability in reverse. The task of figuring out probabilities given data is called <em>inference</em>, and it is the foundation of statistics.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch05lev2sec2"><strong><em>Collecting Data</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The heart of statistical inference is data! So far we have only a single sample from the strange box: you put in a quarter and got nothing back. All we know at this point is that it’s possible to lose your money. The shopkeeper said you can win, but we don’t know that for sure yet.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_47"/>We want to estimate the probability that the mysterious box will deliver two quarters, and to do that, we first need to see how frequently you win after a few more tries.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The shopkeeper informs you that he’s just as curious as you are and will gladly donate a roll of quarters—containing $10 worth of quarters, or 40 quarters—provided you return any winnings to him. You put a quarter in, and happily, two more quarters pop out! Now we have two pieces of data: the mystical box does in fact pay out sometimes, and sometimes it eats the coin.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Given our two observations, one where you lose the quarter and another where you win, you might guess naively that <em>P</em>(two quarters) = 1/2. Since our data is so limited, however, there is still a range of probabilities we might consider for the true rate at which this mysterious box returns two coins. To gather more data, you’ll use the rest of the quarters in the roll. In the end, including your first quarter, you get:</p>&#13;
<p class="equ">14 wins<br/>27 losses</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Without doing any further analysis, you might intuitively want to update your guess that <em>P</em>(two quarters) = 1/2 to <em>P</em>(two quarters) = 14/41. But what about your original guess—does your new data mean it’s impossible that 1/2 is the real probability?</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch05lev2sec3"><strong><em>Calculating the Probability of Probabilities</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">To help solve this problem, let’s look at our two possible probabilities. These are just our hypotheses about the rate at which the magic box returns two quarters:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0047-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">To simplify, we’ll assign each hypothesis a variable:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0047-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Intuitively, most people would say that <em>H</em><sub>2</sub> is more likely because this is exactly what we observed, but we need to demonstrate this mathematically to be sure.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We can think of this problem in terms of how well each hypothesis explains what we saw, so in plain English: “How probable is what we observed if <em>H</em><sub>1</sub> were true versus if <em>H</em><sub>2</sub> were true?” As it turns out, we can easily calculate this using the binomial distribution from <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4</a>. In this case, we know that <em>n</em> = 41 and <em>k</em> = 14, and for now, we’ll assume that <em>p</em> = <em>H</em><sub>1</sub> or <em>H</em><sub>2</sub>. We’ll use <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_48"/><em>D</em> as a variable for our data. When we plug these numbers into the binomial distribution, we get the following results (recall that you can do this with the formula for the binomial distribution in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4</a>):</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0048-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">In other words, if <em>H</em><sub>1</sub> were true and the probability of getting two coins was 1/2, then the probability of observing 14 occasions where we get two coins out of 41 trials would be about 0.016. However, if <em>H</em><sub>2</sub> were true and the real probability of getting two coins out of the box was 14/41, then the probability of observing the same outcomes would be about 0.130.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This shows us that, given the data (observing 14 cases of getting two coins out of 41 trials), <em>H</em><sub>2</sub> is almost 10 times more probable than <em>H</em><sub>1</sub>! However, it also shows that neither hypothesis is <em>impossible</em> and that there are, of course, many other hypotheses we could make based on our data. For example, we might read our data as <em>H</em><sub>3</sub> <em>P</em>(two coins) = 15/42. If we wanted to look for a pattern, we could also pick every probability from 0.1 to 0.9, incrementing by 0.1; calculate the probability of the observed data in each distribution; and develop our hypothesis from that. <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig01">Figure 5-1</a> illustrates what each value looks like in the latter case.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch05fig01"/><img alt="Image" src="../images/05fig01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 5-1: Visualization of different hypotheses about the rate of getting two quarters</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_49"/>Even with all these hypotheses, there’s no way we could cover every possible eventuality because we’re not working with a finite number of hypotheses. So let’s try to get more information by testing more distributions. If we repeat the last experiment, testing each possibility at certain increments starting with 0.01 and ending with 0.99, incrementing by only 0.01 would give us the results in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig02">Figure 5-2</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch05fig02"/><img alt="Image" src="../images/05fig02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 5-2: We see a definite pattern emerging when we look at more hypotheses.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We may not be able to test every possible hypothesis, but it’s clear a pattern is emerging here: we see something that looks like a distribution representing what we believe is the behavior of the black box.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This seems like valuable information; we can easily see where the probability is highest. Our goal, however, is to model our beliefs in all possible hypotheses (that is, the full probability distribution of our beliefs). There are still two problems with our approach. First, because there’s an infinite number of possible hypotheses, incrementing by smaller and smaller amounts doesn’t accurately represent the entire range of possibilities—we’re always missing an infinite amount. In practice, this isn’t a huge problem because we often don’t care about the extremes like 0.000001 and 0.0000011, but the data would be more useful if we could represent this infinite range of possibilities a bit more accurately.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Second, if you looked at the graph closely, you may have noticed a larger problem here: there are at least 10 dots above 0.1 right now, and we have an infinite number of points to add. This means that our probabilities <em>don’t sum to 1</em>! From the rules of probability, we know that the probabilities of all our possible hypotheses must sum to 1. If they don’t, it means that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_50"/>some hypotheses are not covered. If they add up to more than 1, we would be violating the rule that probabilities must be between 0 and 1. Even though there are infinitely many possibilities here, we still need them all to sum to 1. This is where the beta distribution comes in.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec2"><strong>The Beta Distribution</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">To solve both of these problems, we’ll be using the beta distribution. Unlike the binomial distribution, which breaks up nicely into discrete values, the beta distribution represents a continuous range of values, which allows us to represent our infinite number of possible hypotheses.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We define the beta distribution with a <em>probability density function (PDF)</em>, which is very similar to the probability mass function we use in the binomial distribution, but is defined for continuous values. Here is the formula for the PDF of the beta distribution:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0050-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now this looks like a much more terrifying formula than the one for our binomial distribution! But it’s actually not that different. We won’t build this formula entirely from scratch like we did with the probability mass function, but let’s break down some of what’s happening here.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch05lev2sec4"><strong><em>Breaking Down the Probability Density Function</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Let’s first take a look at our parameters: <em>p</em>, α (lowercase Greek letter alpha), and β (lowercase Greek letter beta).</p>&#13;
<p class="hangt"><em><strong>p</strong></em> Represents the probability of an event. This corresponds to our different hypotheses for the possible probabilities for our black box.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong>α</strong> Represents how many times we observe an event we care about, such as getting two quarters from the box.</p>&#13;
<p class="hangb"><strong>β</strong> Represents how many times the event we care about <em>didn’t</em> happen. For our example, this is the number of times that the black box ate the quarter.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The total number of trials is α + β. This is different than the binomial distribution, where we have <em>k</em> observations we’re interested in and a finite number of <em>n</em> total trials.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The top part of the PDF function should look pretty familiar because it’s almost the same as the binomial distribution’s PMF, which looks like this:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0050-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_51"/>In the PDF, rather than <em>p<sup>k</sup></em> × (1 – <em>p</em>)<sup><em>n</em>–<em>k</em></sup>, we have <em>p</em><sup>α–1</sup> × (1 – <em>p</em>)<sup>β–1</sup> where we subtract 1 from the exponent terms. We also have another function in the denominator of our equation: the <em>beta</em> function (note the lowercase) for which the beta distribution is named. We subtract 1 from the exponent and use the beta function to <em>normalize</em> our values—this is the part that ensures our distribution sums to 1. The beta function is the <em>integral</em> from 0 to 1 of <em>p</em><sup>α–1</sup> × (1 – <em>p</em>)<sup>β–1</sup>. We’ll talk about integrals more in the next section, but you can think of this as the sum of all the possible values of <em>p</em><sup>α–1</sup> × (1 – <em>p</em>)<sup>β–1</sup> when <em>p</em> is every number between 0 and 1. A discussion of how subtracting 1 from the exponents and dividing by the beta functions normalizes our values is beyond the scope of this chapter; for now, you just need to know that this allows our values to sum to 1, giving us a workable probability.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">What we get in the end is a function that describes the probability of each possible hypothesis for our true belief in the probability of getting two heads from the box, given that we have observed α examples of one outcome and β examples of another. Remember that we arrived at the beta distribution by comparing how well different binomial distributions, each with its own probability <em>p</em>, described our data. In other words, the beta distribution represents how well all possible binomial distributions describe the data observed.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch05lev2sec5"><strong><em>Applying the Probability Density Function to Our Problem</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">When we plug in our values for our black box data and visualize the beta distribution, shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig03">Figure 5-3</a>, we see that it looks like a smooth version of the plot in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig02">Figure 5-2</a>. This illustrates the PDF of Beta(14,27).</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch05fig03"/><img alt="Image" src="../images/05fig03.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 5-3: Visualizing the beta distribution for our data collected about the black box</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_52"/>As you can see, most of the plot’s density is less than 0.5, as we would expect given that our data shows that fewer than half of the quarters placed in the black box returned two quarters.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The plot also shows that it’s very unlikely the black box will return two quarters at least half the time, which is the point at which we break even if we continually put quarters in the box. We’ve figured out that we’re more likely to lose money than make money through the box, without sacrificing too many quarters. While we can see the distribution of our beliefs by looking at a plot, we’d still like to be able to quantify exactly how strongly we believe that “the probability that the true rate at which the box returns two quarters is less than 0.5.” To do this, we need just a bit of calculus (and some R).</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch05lev2sec6"><strong><em>Quantifying Continuous Distributions with Integration</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The beta distribution is fundamentally different from the binomial distribution in that with the latter, we are looking at the distribution of <em>k</em>, the number of outcomes we care about, which is always something we can count. For the beta distribution, however, we are looking at the distribution of <em>p</em>, for which we have an infinite number of possible values. This leads to an interesting problem that might be familiar if you’ve studied calculus before (but it’s okay if you haven’t!). For our example of α=14 and β=27, we want to know: what is the probability that the chance of getting two coins is 1/2?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">While it’s easy to ask the likelihood of an exact value with the binomial distribution thanks to its finite number of outcomes, this is a really tricky question for a continuous distribution. We know that the fundamental rule of probability is that the sum of all our values must be 1, but each of our individual values is <em>infinitely</em> small, meaning the probability of any specific value is in practice 0.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This may seem strange if you aren’t familiar with continuous functions from calculus, so as a quick explanation: this is just the logical consequence of having something made up of an infinite number of pieces. Imagine, for example, you divide a 1-pound bar of chocolate (pretty big!) into two pieces. Each piece would then weigh 1/2 a pound. If you divided it into 10 pieces, each piece would weigh 1/10 a pound. As the number of pieces you divide the chocolate into grows, each piece becomes so small you can’t even see it. For the case where the number of pieces goes to infinity, eventually those pieces disappear!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Even though the individual pieces disappear, we can still talk about ranges. For example, even if we divided a 1-pound bar of chocolate into infinitely many pieces, we can still add up the weight of the pieces in one half of the chocolate bar. Similarly, when talking about probability in continuous distributions, we can sum up ranges of values. But if every specific value is 0, then isn’t the sum just 0 as well?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_53"/>This is where calculus comes in: in calculus, there’s a special way of summing up infinitely small values called the <em>integral</em>. If we want to know whether the probability that the box will return a coin is less than 0.5 (that is, the value is somewhere between 0 and 0.5), we can sum it up like this:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0053-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you’re rusty on calculus, the stretched-out <em>S</em> is the continuous function equivalent to ∑ for discrete functions. It’s just a way to express that we want to add up all the little bits of our function (see <a href="app02.xhtml#app02">Appendix B</a> for a quick overview of the basic principles of calculus).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If this math is starting to look too scary, don’t worry! We’ll use R to calculate this for us. R includes a function called <span class="literal">dbeta()</span> that is the PDF for the beta distribution. This function takes three arguments, corresponding to <em>p</em>, α, and β. We use this together with R’s <span class="literal">integrate()</span> function to perform this integration automatically. Here we calculate the probability that the chance of getting two coins from the box is 0.5, given the data:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt; integrate(function(p) dbeta(p,14,27),0,0.5)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The result is as follows:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">0.9807613 with absolute error &lt; 5.9e-06</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The “absolute error” message appears because computers can’t perfectly calculate integrals so there is always some error, though usually it is far too small for us to worry about. This result from R tells us that there is a 0.98 probability that, given our evidence, the true probability of getting two coins out of the black box is less than 0.5. This means it would not be good idea to put any more quarters in the box, since you very likely won’t break even.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec3"><strong>Reverse-Engineering the Gacha Game</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In real-life situations, we almost never know the true probabilities for events. That’s why the beta distribution is one of our most powerful tools for understanding our data. In the Gacha game in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4</a>, we knew the probability of each card we wanted to pull. In reality, the game developers are very unlikely to give players this information, for many reasons (such as not wanting players to calculate how unlikely they are to get the card they want). Now suppose we are playing a new Gacha game called <em>Frequentist Fighters!</em> and it also features famous statisticians. This time, we are pulling for the Bradley Efron card.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We don’t know the rates for the card, but we really want that card—and more than one if possible. We spend a ridiculous amount of money and find that from 1,200 cards pulled, we received only 5 Bradley Efron cards. Our <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_54"/>friend is thinking of spending money on the game but only wants to do it if there is a better than 0.7 probability that the chance of pulling a Bradley Efron is greater than 0.005.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Our friend has asked us to figure out whether he should spend the money and pull. Our data tells us that of 1,200 cards pulled, only 5 were Bradley Efron, so we can visualize this as Beta(5,1195), shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig04">Figure 5-4</a> (remember that the total cards pulled is α + β).</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch05fig04"/><img alt="Image" src="../images/05fig04.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 5-4: The beta distribution for getting a Bradley Efron card given our data</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">From our visualization we can see that nearly all the probability density is below 0.01. We need to know exactly how much is above 0.005, the value that our friend cares about. We can solve this by integrating over the beta distribution in R, as earlier:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">integrate(function(x) dbeta(x,5,1195),0.005,1)<br/>&#13;
0.29</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This tells us the probability that the rate of pulling a Bradley Efron card is 0.005 or greater, given the evidence we have observed, is only 0.29. Our friend will pull for this card only if the probability is around 0.7 or greater, so based on the evidence from our data collection, our friend should <em>not</em> try his luck.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_55"/><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned about the beta distribution, which is closely related to the binomial distribution but behaves quite differently. We built up to the beta distribution by observing how well an increasing number of possible binomial distributions explained our data. Because our number of possible hypotheses was infinite, we needed a continuous probability distribution that could describe all of them. The beta distribution allows us to represent how strongly we believe in all possible probabilities for the data we observed. This enables us to perform statistical inference on observed data by determining which probabilities we might assign to an event and how strongly we believe in each one: a probability of probabilities.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The major difference between the beta distribution and the binomial distribution is that the beta distribution is a <em>continuous</em> probability distribution. Because there are an infinite number of values in the distribution, we cannot sum results the same way we do in a discrete probability distribution. Instead, we need to use calculus to sum ranges of values. Fortunately, we can use R instead of solving tricky integrals by hand.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec5"><strong>Exercises</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Try answering the following questions to make sure you understand how we can use the Beta distribution to estimate probabilities. The solutions can be found at <em><a href="https://nostarch.com/learnbayes/">https://nostarch.com/learnbayes/</a></em>.</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li class="noindent">You want to use the beta distribution to determine whether or not a coin you have is a fair coin—meaning that the coin gives you heads and tails equally. You flip the coin 10 times and get 4 heads and 6 tails. Using the beta distribution, what is the probability that the coin will land on heads more than 60 percent of the time?</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">You flip the coin 10 more times and now have 9 heads and 11 tails total. What is the probability that the coin is fair, using our definition of fair, give or take 5 percent?</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Data is the best way to become more confident in your assertions. You flip the coin 200 more times and end up with 109 heads and 111 tails. Now what is the probability that the coin is fair, give or take 5 percent?<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_56"/></li>&#13;

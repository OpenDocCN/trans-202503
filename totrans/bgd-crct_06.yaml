- en: One of the first things I wanted to learn in electronics as a kid was how to
    blink a light. You can do this in one of several ways, but this circuit is probably
    the easiest way to do it, especially because it requires so few components. In
    fact, you need only five components, including the resistor and the LED.

- en: The circuit works around an *inverter*, a component that outputs the opposite
    voltage of what it takes in. If it gets a *high* voltage in, it gives a *low*
    voltage out, and vice versa. A high voltage is a voltage close to the positive
    supply voltage (9 V in this case), and a low voltage is a voltage close to 0 V.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The output of the inverter (U1) is connected back to the input with a resistor,
    which causes *oscillation*, or jumping back and forth between high and low voltage.
    If the inverter input is high, then its output will be low. You connect that low-voltage
    output back to the inverter’s input, and because the input is low, the output
    will be high. That high-voltage output is directed back to the inverter’s input,
    and so on.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To slow down the oscillation enough to see the LED blink, you use a capacitor
    on the input of the inverter. A *capacitor* stores and discharges energy; the
    charging and discharging of the capacitor in this circuit (C1) will increase the
    time it takes for the input to go from low to high and from high to low. The resistor
    (R1) controls how much current goes back and forth to charge and discharge the
    capacitor, so the size of R1 and C1 determines the speed of the oscillation.

- en: You should use a 74C14 IC *Schmitt trigger* inverter; its threshold for switching
    from high to low voltage is different from the threshold for switching from low
    to high. This ensures that the inverter doesn’t get stuck in a state in between
    high and low.

    single chip with its own internal circuitry. The number next to each pin in the
    circuit diagram represents the pin number on the integrated circuit. [Figure 5-1](ch05.xhtml#ch05fig1)
    shows how the pins are arranged on the 74C14 IC Schmitt trigger inverter.

    output, and vice versa. You can build a simple inverter using a transistor and
    a couple of resistors, as shown in [Figure 5-3](ch05.xhtml#ch05fig3).

    resistance between the collector and emitter (Rt in the diagram), and when the
    transistor is on, you can look at it as a resistor with zero resistance. You might
    find this easier to understand if you ignore the input for a second and just look
    at the output circuit, as in [Figure 5-4](ch05.xhtml#ch05fig4). You may have noticed
    that you get a voltage divider.

    really high resistance—say, billions of ohms. A normal value for R1 is 1,000 Ω,
    so if you have 9 V as V[in] and you try to put 1 billion ohms into the formula
    as Rt, the result is 9 V—a high output.

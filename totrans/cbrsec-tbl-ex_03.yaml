    This chapter will walk you through that process, outlining the factors you should
    consider in the preparation and planning stage. The advice in this chapter comes

    questions that you’ll need to answer prior to constructing the tabletop exercise.

    level is providing support? What are the organization’s goals and objectives?
    What is the exercise’s tenor? Whom should you invite? What logistics are involved,
    and who will be handling them? Those responsible for developing the tabletop exercise,
    as well as executives wanting to understand their function in the process, tend
    to care about the answers to these planning questions. After all, the exercise
    will take place in front of their peers, leadership, and vendors, and in such
    a situation, nobody wants to be caught off guard.'

    marketing, legal, public relations, information technology, and information security,
    in addition to other cross-functional positions. Due to the level of visibility,
    range of functions, and likelihood that the exercise will include a variety of
    senior management, it would make sense to select the chief information officer,
    the chief operations officer, or a similar executive as the sponsor.

    necessarily need an in-depth mastery of the topic. Their primary value comes from
    their awareness of the organization’s cultural norms, their long-standing relationships
    with a variety of employees, and their influence among those they are sponsoring.
    As you’ll see when we cover the expectations of the executive sponsor, the occasional

- en: It might also be beneficial to select an executive sponsor with an interest
    in the goals and objectives of the tabletop scenario. (We’ll cover these topics
    in [“Defining the Exercise’s Goals and Objectives”](chapter2.xhtml#h-33) on page
    26.) For example, if an organization wishes to educate stakeholders about recent
    privacy legislation, you might choose a senior executive in the legal department.
    Alternatively, if the organization hopes to rehearse public-facing aspects of
    an incident, such as how to communicate with the public, you might want to request
    a chief communications officer as the executive sponsor.

    If the exercise explores strategic business issues, it’s likely to be senior level.

    leave participants without significant opportunities for participation, and they
    may end up frustrated that they wasted their time. The best tabletops tend to
    have 10 to 15 attendees, making them large enough to include many roles but small
    enough to create a collaborative environment. However, don’t be afraid to run
    a tabletop exercise with fewer attendees. Even small information technology and

    remotely. While tabletops can succeed in a remote environment, in-person exercises
    tend to be more intimate. The facilitator and team members can greet participants
    personally as they enter the physical space and engage in small talk. During the
    actual tabletop exercise, the facilitator can also read body language and assess
    participants’ behaviors, which can help clarify their reactions to points brought
    up in the exercise. Remote exercises immediately handicap the facilitator; the
    usual handshake won’t occur, and visual cues may be easier to miss or absent altogether.

    with each other to explore certain issues, perhaps during a lunch break.

    moments” that occur before and after the exercise. If the goal is to bring together
    employees who are largely unfamiliar with each other, in-person tabletop exercises
    will pay the most dividends and are worth the investment. However, if participants
    are already very familiar with each other, a remote tabletop exercise may be sufficient.

    the tabletop exercise and let that dictate the tone. Industry veterans probably
    don’t want to face a drill sergeant, but they might benefit from a facilitator

- en: Also consider the organization’s cybersecurity maturity spectrum. If the company
    has historically treated cybersecurity as an afterthought, a collaborative or
    hand-holding approach would be beneficial, as it would meet participants where
    they are. The team could get their feet wet, discussing and learning basic response
    steps and best practices, instead of making their first foray into incident response
    during an actual engagement.

- en: Lastly, if the organization is primarily performing the tabletop to gather stakeholders
    and build trust, the tone of the tabletop should reflect this goal. But if the
    organization wishes to dig into the roles and responsibilities expected of stakeholders,
    it may be prudent to adopt a more aggressive demeanor. However, always remain
    professional, polite, and tactful. Adopting a challenging approach doesn’t give
    you a license to be condescending, insulting, or overly pedantic.

- en: One way to initially announce the basic details of a tabletop exercise is via
    the executive sponsor. It’s likely that your sponsor regularly communicates with
    a larger team about business updates, the status of initiatives, hiring, and so
    on. These checkpoints provide an opportunity for the sponsor to discuss the exercise,
    explain its purpose, and describe why the organization has chosen to invest in
    the activity. Because the sponsor is in a position of authority, they can also
    communicate the importance of the exercise.
  id: totrans-199

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 一种最初宣布桌面演练基本细节的方法是通过执行赞助人。很可能，赞助人定期与更大的团队沟通业务更新、项目状态、招聘情况等。这些检查点提供了一个机会，赞助人可以讨论演练、解释其目的，并描述为何组织决定投资该活动。由于赞助人处于权威位置，他们还可以传达演练的重要性。
- en: In their message, it could be helpful for the executive sponsor to highlight
    a recent cybersecurity incident familiar to the workforce, whether it be a high-profile
    news story or an issue that occurred within the organization itself. Ideally,
    this should help participants understand why the tabletop is being performed.
    In addition, the executive sponsor can briefly name the members of the development
    team, the development lead, and the facilitator, as well as disclose next steps.
  id: totrans-200
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 在他们的信息中，执行赞助人可以突出一件最近为员工熟知的网络安全事件，无论是一个备受关注的新闻故事，还是发生在组织内部的问题。理想情况下，这应有助于参与者理解为何进行桌面演练。此外，执行赞助人可以简要提及开发团队成员、开发负责人和引导员，并透露接下来的步骤。
- en: Most importantly, this message shouldn’t go into much depth and should convey
    a positive attitude. If the sponsor strikes a negative tone (for example, “I know
    no one wants to do this, but let’s just get through it”), attendees might get
    the impression that this is just another check-the-box affair not worth their
    effort.
  id: totrans-201

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 最重要的是，这条消息不应过于详细，应传达一种积极的态度。如果赞助人采取消极语气（例如，“我知道没有人想做这个，但我们就做完它吧”），与会者可能会产生这是一个毫无意义、仅仅是走个过场的活动的印象，觉得不值得付出努力。

- en: Finally, it’s important that the members of the development team and the executive
    sponsor continually share these concerns with each other. If all members of the

    to provide nuance to the scenario. Decision-makers will be forced to adjust on
    the fly to the participant’s absence—a circumstance that could certainly arise
    during a real-world event. This option is appropriate for tabletop exercises that
    aim to stress-test existing processes or discover single sources of failure, a
    common issue in responding to cybersecurity incidents. If the remaining participants

- en: First, during an actual incident, parties involved in the response will be immersed
    in the “fog of war”; they won’t immediately be sure of the incident’s impact on
    the organization, how the organization was attacked, and other factors. Tabletop
    exercises should be no different. Not releasing details prior to the exercise

    to make quick decisions, as they would during an incident.

  zh: 首先，在实际事件中，参与响应的各方将会沉浸在“战争迷雾”中；他们无法立即确认事件对组织的影响、组织是如何受到攻击的以及其他因素。桌面演练应该与此无异。在演练前不公开细节，将使参与者在情境展开时感到惊讶，并需要他们像处理实际事件一样迅速做出决策。
- en: Secondly, if participants know the details of the exercise, they tend to arrive
    with scripted replies to demonstrate they know the correct answer. One of the
    many reasons to perform a tabletop exercise is to have participants discuss the
    pros and cons of potential responses, recognize shortcomings in technology or
    organizational processes, and bring forward their particular interests. These
    discussions occur as participants collaborate, a process that is impaired when
    they’re allowed to know details ahead of time.

  zh: 其次，如果参与者知道演练的细节，他们往往会带着预设的回答来演练，表现出他们知道正确答案。进行桌面演练的众多原因之一，是让参与者讨论潜在反应的利弊，识别技术或组织流程中的不足，并提出他们的特定关注点。这些讨论发生在参与者协作时，如果允许他们提前知道细节，这一过程就会受到阻碍。

    a determined chief executive officer, majority owner, or board member requests
    access to the materials, they can barrel over your executive sponsor. On the bright
    side, having an executive take an interest in the tabletop exercise is an opportunity
    to demonstrate that there isn’t anything to fear about it, and in the next event,
    you can make a special effort to get this person to buy into keeping the scenario
    confidential now that a relationship has been built.

    tabletop exercise. While this is a drastic measure, a participant actively opposing

- en: Many organizations lack a large enough information security budget to bring
    in an external consultant, which can be costly. Tabletop exercises can range in
    price from $5,000 to $25,000 depending on the required planning, complexity, delivery
    mechanism, duration, reporting, and other factors. For some companies, the cost
    of bringing in an external party may be a nonstarter.

    to plan, develop, and facilitate such an event. It’s quite possible that no staff
    member has ever participated in a tabletop exercise before, whether with their
    current employer or in a past career. By contrast, individual members of a consultancy
    firm may execute 30 or more tabletop exercises a year and have the know-how to
    navigate potential roadblocks or hurdles. As a compromise, some organizations
    hire an external facilitator but treat the development process as an opportunity
    to also cross-train an internal employee for the next exercise.

    one consultancy firm may specialize in incident response and another in payment
    card industry compliance. These external vendors can answer questions such as
    “How are we doing compared to our peers?” An external vendor who is a veteran
    at facilitating a large number of tabletop exercises across numerous organizations
    and industry verticals provides invaluable knowledge.
  id: totrans-276

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In some organizations, there is a culture of looking to outside experts for
    guidance. In these cases, the organization may be more inclined to act upon recommendations
    of an external vendor, even if employees have made similar suggestions in the
    past. Those employees can use this to their advantage by having the external consultant
    advocate for important changes. For example, if an information security director
    has asked to implement multifactor authentication and been rebuffed, an external
    consultant can weave this issue into a tabletop exercise and list it as an identified
    deficiency.

- en: Lastly, the outsourced tabletop exercise could serve as a *third-party assessment*
    meant to provide an unbiased point of view. (To remove as much residual bias as
    possible, choose a consultancy with few or no business connections with the organization.)
    Third-party assessments are a powerful tool, as observations and recommendations
    are unlikely to be clouded by conflicting interests. Also, external stakeholders
    evaluating an organization’s information security posture may be suspicious of
    an internally conducted tabletop exercise that resulted in glowing reviews and
    few deficiencies. These third-party assessments are particularly salient to parties
    such as cyber insurance underwriters or auditors, who may even request copies
    of the documentation when assessing the risks of conducting business with the
    organization. Having proof of a tabletop exercise performed by a third party lends
    credibility to the report.

- en: However, if you choose to outsource an exercise to a vendor, make sure to find
    the proper fit with the consultant assigned to the exercise. If, for example,
    a premier US art museum hired an external vendor to perform a tabletop exercise,
    and during their first meeting, the consultant said, “You guys have a bunch of
    painted canvases made by starving artists, right?” In doing so, the consultant
    demonstrated a lack of appreciation for the artwork, which was immensely important
    to museum staff. A consultant should be able to fit seamlessly into the organization,
    quickly understand the rungs on the organizational ladder, and not prompt a collective
    facepalm from the group.

  zh: 然而，如果您选择将演练外包给供应商，请确保与被分配到演练的顾问匹配适当。例如，一个顶尖的美国艺术博物馆雇用外部供应商进行桌面演练，在他们的第一次会议期间，顾问说：“你们有一堆由饥饿的艺术家制作的油画，对吧？”通过这样做，顾问显示出对艺术作品的不重视，而这对博物馆员工来说非常重要。顾问应能够无缝融入组织，快速理解组织结构中的层级，并且不会引起集体的失望。
- en: If you’re using an outside consultant to avoid dedicating too many internal
    resources to a tabletop exercise, be sure to ask about the consultant’s development
    methodology, including how much time and what activities will be required of internal
    staff members. It’s unlikely that they’ll need to assemble the development team
    from the organization’s staff, but a good consultant should solicit feedback from
    employees to ensure that the scenario they’re developing is pertinent and meets
    the exercise’s goals and objectives. If an outside consultant requires several
    hours of the organization’s time to brainstorm scenarios, review deliverables,
    assist with revisions, and so on, the relationship may not realize the intended
    value, but someone showing up with a canned scenario that has nothing to do with
    the organization or its business may be even worse.

  zh: 如果您使用外部顾问来避免过多地使用内部资源进行桌面演练，请务必询问顾问的开发方法，包括需要内部员工投入多少时间和进行哪些活动。他们不太可能需要从组织的员工中组建开发团队，但优秀的顾问应该征求员工的反馈，以确保他们正在开发的场景相关并符合演练的目标。如果外部顾问需要组织几个小时来进行头脑风暴场景、审查可交付成果、协助修订等工作，则这种关系可能无法实现预期的价值，但是，如果有人出现并提供与组织或其业务无关的标准化场景，则可能会更糟。

    This chapter will walk you through that process, outlining the factors you should
    consider in the preparation and planning stage. The advice in this chapter comes
    from hundreds of conversations with our clients, who frequently ask the same several
    questions that you’ll need to answer prior to constructing the tabletop exercise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'These foundational questions include the following: Who from the executive
    level is providing support? What are the organization’s goals and objectives?
    What is the exercise’s tenor? Whom should you invite? What logistics are involved,
    and who will be handling them? Those responsible for developing the tabletop exercise,
    as well as executives wanting to understand their function in the process, tend
    to care about the answers to these planning questions. After all, the exercise
    will take place in front of their peers, leadership, and vendors, and in such
    a situation, nobody wants to be caught off guard.'

    support from an executive sponsor. The sponsor’s exact role and identity will
    vary depending on the type of exercise you’re pursuing, the maturity of the organization,
    and the participants in the exercise, but sponsors are generally two or more rungs
    higher on an organizational chart than the highest-ranking participant.

    tabletop exercise would likely be the IT help desk manager. In this case, it would
    be appropriate for an information security officer, a security director, or someone
    in a similar position to function as the executive sponsor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    marketing, legal, public relations, information technology, and information security,
    in addition to other cross-functional positions. Due to the level of visibility,
    range of functions, and likelihood that the exercise will include a variety of
    senior management, it would make sense to select the chief information officer,
    the chief operations officer, or a similar executive as the sponsor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    necessarily need an in-depth mastery of the topic. Their primary value comes from
    their awareness of the organization’s cultural norms, their long-standing relationships
    with a variety of employees, and their influence among those they are sponsoring.
    As you’ll see when we cover the expectations of the executive sponsor, the occasional
    email from them may be all you need to move your stalled tabletop exercise along
    or get participants to focus on the event.

    in the goals and objectives of the tabletop scenario. (We’ll cover these topics
    in [“Defining the Exercise’s Goals and Objectives”](chapter2.xhtml#h-33) on page
    26.) For example, if an organization wishes to educate stakeholders about recent
    privacy legislation, you might choose a senior executive in the legal department.
    Alternatively, if the organization hopes to rehearse public-facing aspects of
    an incident, such as how to communicate with the public, you might want to request
    a chief communications officer as the executive sponsor.

    doesn’t have to attend every planning meeting; however, they should join at least
    one of them—ideally the first, which lays the foundation for future planning and
    reinforces their support. Additionally, should the executive sponsor have concerns
    about the direction of the tabletop exercise, they’re able to express these as
    early as possible. By attending these meetings, they can better understand the
    status of the exercise, make sure the plan aligns with the organization’s interests,
    and help remedy potential roadblocks. Perhaps most importantly, their attendance
    reinforces their continued commitment to the exercise.

    the importance of the exercise. In some cases, they may need to sell the exercise
    to peers. It’s not uncommon to face resistance from individuals across the organization,
    including those at the executive level, who believe the exercise isn’t important
    to their role or team. You’d be surprised by how often a simple email from the
    sponsor can magically clear schedules and rearrange priorities.

    highly regulated industry or engage in business with other entities. Some organizations
    may also choose to have the legal team direct the exercise. In such cases, the
    executive sponsor may be a member of the organization’s legal team, or a legal
    representative may serve as a co-sponsor. In all cases, the executive sponsor
    should be aware of any potential legal issues.

    the tabletop exercise. The sponsor’s name on the calendar invite will encourage
    attendees to prioritize the meeting and participate actively, rather than passively
    listen with their head focused on their email inbox. If the sponsor’s presence
    creates a sense of stuffiness, however, you should make an effort to ensure that
    all participants feel comfortable speaking up—for example, by having the sponsor
    issue a friendly statement reinforcing the value of participation.

    that an organization would like to achieve. *Objectives*, or intermediary steps
    in the pursuit of goals, are short term and defined with greater granularity.
    For example, a college senior at a four-year university studying information technology
    might have the goal of securing a job with an information security team. Their
    objectives might be to finish their degree, earn the Security+ certification,
    and land an internship. The objectives are specific and feed into the overall
    goal.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might conceive of a tabletop exercise as either a goal or an objective.
    Say an organization has a goal of all key staff members becoming familiar with
    the incident response plan. A tabletop exercise may be only one of several steps
    it takes to familiarize them with the plan, making the exercise an objective.
    On the other hand, the successful completion of a tabletop exercise could itself
    be the goal, in which case objectives might be educating the staff about the incident
    response plan, exploring a ransomware event’s impact on operations, or testing
    the incident management process.

    how a cybersecurity incident can quickly careen beyond the realm of information
    security and involve a variety of nontechnical employees. To demonstrate this,
    you could develop a scenario that pulls in a wide range of participants.
  prefs: []

    find themselves wondering why they’re there. Rarely does a cybersecurity incident
    require only a small team, and a properly developed scenario can help participants—whether
    they come from marketing, legal, or finance—better understand their role in the
    response.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    turnover within the organization, changes in the team structure, or acquisitions
    and divestitures that shrink or grow the team. Each of these situations may impact
    who is a part of the response to an incident, and a tabletop exercise can help
    participants reorient themselves.

    they’re a managed security services provider (MSSP), an external legal counsel,
    a breach coach, or some other entity. Even vendors that have little to do with
    information security, such as an organization that prints and mails statements
    for a financial institution, can become involved in an incident. Tabletop exercises
    are an excellent way to assess how well the vendor and organization coordinate
    during an incident and identify any gaps in the response. At a minimum, the tabletop
    exercise provides an opportunity for the internal information security team to
    foster a collaborative working relationship with the external vendor.

    is not well prepared, and requirements from cyber insurance and regulatory bodies
    only add to their complexity. Tabletop exercises are an excellent way to ensure

    handle internal and external notifications, and can meet any notification deadlines.

    remotely. While tabletops can succeed in a remote environment, in-person exercises
    tend to be more intimate. The facilitator and team members can greet participants
    personally as they enter the physical space and engage in small talk. During the
    actual tabletop exercise, the facilitator can also read body language and assess
    participants’ behaviors, which can help clarify their reactions to points brought
    up in the exercise. Remote exercises immediately handicap the facilitator; the
    usual handshake won’t occur, and visual cues may be easier to miss or absent altogether.
    In addition, in-person exercises make it easier for participants to interact directly
    with each other to explore certain issues, perhaps during a lunch break.

    physically present in a conference room and others connected via video or phone.
    Facilitating a hybrid tabletop exercise is especially challenging, however, because
    the in-person participants will inevitably command the forum, and both they and
    the facilitator can easily forget about the remote attendees. [Chapter 4](chapter4.xhtml)
    explores other factors you should consider when facilitating such an exercise.
  prefs: []

    why the exercise is being performed. Often, one of its objectives is to form stronger
    bonds among participants, which often happens due to the inevitable “watercooler
    moments” that occur before and after the exercise. If the goal is to bring together
    employees who are largely unfamiliar with each other, in-person tabletop exercises
    will pay the most dividends and are worth the investment. However, if participants
    are already very familiar with each other, a remote tabletop exercise may be sufficient.

    for example, a distribution company may need to process overnight orders in the
    morning. Finally, for global organizations with employees spread between, say,
    the United Kingdom and Canada, you’ll need to aim for a later start for the United

    and Jay Bell) recognizes that this may be a new experience for some. We’re available
    to answer any questions you may have and will also set up an optional discussion
    session on March 20 at 10 AM and again on March 22 at 4 PM in the Evergreen Conference
    Room. Any questions are welcome. Of course, should any questions pop up before
    these sessions, you’re welcome to respond to this email or stop by my office.

    following the tabletop exercise. If several key participants have to run to their
    next meeting right after a two-hour tabletop exercise, the evaluation phase will

- en: The optional discussion session is an opportunity for attendees to ask questions
    before the tabletop exercise occurs. You can treat these sessions like a professor’s
    office hours; attendees or other interested stakeholders can casually raise lingering
    concerns. The development lead and possibly additional members from the development
    team should plan on joining, and you should try to offer at least two sessions
    to account for conflicts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to helping ease attendee concerns, discussion sessions allow the
    exercise facilitator to bond with attendees prior to the tabletop exercise. Simply
    shaking hands, chatting about activities for the upcoming weekend, or knowing
    that a particular attendee is a new aunt provides valuable conversation fodder
    for the day of the tabletop exercise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, these discussions can surface common themes that the development team
    or executive sponsor might need to address. For example, if several attendees
    tell you, “We heard this exercise will be used to justify outsourcing more of
    the information security team,” you can quickly address that concern before the
    exercise begins.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In addition to structured interactions such as the discussion sessions, the
    development team and executive sponsor can try to create informal touchpoints
    with attendees. Think of these as watercooler moments, those impromptu gatherings
    where employees discuss topics ranging from sports to the latest office news.
    If the opportunity arises, the development team members and executive sponsor
    can casually ask individual attendees how they feel about the upcoming exercise.
    It’s during these informal interactions that employees may be most likely to reveal
    underlying concerns.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, an informal touchpoint with a tabletop participant in the office
    breakroom could reveal that they are worried about the exercise’s time commitment
    or fear looking foolish as a new employee. While these comments may seem trivial,
    investing the time to allay these concerns will yield a better tabletop exercise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, it’s important that the members of the development team and the executive
    sponsor continually share these concerns with each other. If all members of the
    development team hear the same concern from different sources, it’s an indication
    that they need to provide additional clarification on a certain topic.

- en: The Final Reminder
  prefs:
  - PREF_H4
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Approximately three business days before the event, send a reminder to all tabletop
    attendees. This reminder gives you one last chance to change the scenario if someone
    in an important role is unable to attend. For example, if your scenario focuses
    on the legal obligations of an organization that loses employee data and the legal
    representative has a family emergency, you may need to quickly alter the scenario
    or reschedule the exercise altogether.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alternatively, you could use the absence of a key participant as an opportunity
    to provide nuance to the scenario. Decision-makers will be forced to adjust on
    the fly to the participant’s absence—a circumstance that could certainly arise
    during a real-world event. This option is appropriate for tabletop exercises that
    aim to stress-test existing processes or discover single sources of failure, a
    common issue in responding to cybersecurity incidents. If the remaining participants
    all defer to the missing representative from legal, the development team has just
    discovered their first (and very important) recommendation.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While it’s fine for members of the organization to know that a tabletop exercise
    is on the horizon, it’s important to maintain a degree of confidentiality about
    the scenario, goals, and objectives. Some participants may be nervous and ask
    to know about the scenario ahead of time. However, the confidentiality of the
    scenario is critical to the success of the tabletop exercise for several reasons.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, during an actual incident, parties involved in the response will be immersed
    in the “fog of war”; they won’t immediately be sure of the incident’s impact on
    the organization, how the organization was attacked, and other factors. Tabletop
    exercises should be no different. Not releasing details prior to the exercise
    will leave participants surprised by the scenario as it unfolds and require them
    to make quick decisions, as they would during an incident.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Secondly, if participants know the details of the exercise, they tend to arrive
    with scripted replies to demonstrate they know the correct answer. One of the
    many reasons to perform a tabletop exercise is to have participants discuss the
    pros and cons of potential responses, recognize shortcomings in technology or
    organizational processes, and bring forward their particular interests. These
    discussions occur as participants collaborate, a process that is impaired when
    they’re allowed to know details ahead of time.

    shouldn’t be released in advance.

    a determined chief executive officer, majority owner, or board member requests
    access to the materials, they can barrel over your executive sponsor. On the bright
    side, having an executive take an interest in the tabletop exercise is an opportunity
    to demonstrate that there isn’t anything to fear about it, and in the next event,
    you can make a special effort to get this person to buy into keeping the scenario
    confidential now that a relationship has been built.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Often, these conversations can occur over a cup of coffee or after a standing
    team meeting. However, if the individual’s opposition remains after you’ve made
    reasonable efforts to address it, ask the executive sponsor to intervene prior
    to the event. In rare cases, the team might need to remove an employee from the
    tabletop exercise. While this is a drastic measure, a participant actively opposing
    the tabletop during the actual event could throw the exercise into disarray.

- en: Outsourcing Tabletop Exercises
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the complexity of the information technology landscape has grown, many organizations
    now outsource their cybersecurity needs to remote services such as vCISOs and
    SOCs. Tabletop exercises are just one of many cybersecurity activities that an
    organization can outsource to a trusted vendor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many organizations lack a large enough information security budget to bring
    in an external consultant, which can be costly. Tabletop exercises can range in
    price from $5,000 to $25,000 depending on the required planning, complexity, delivery
    mechanism, duration, reporting, and other factors. For some companies, the cost
    of bringing in an external party may be a nonstarter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the other hand, some organizations lack the necessary resources or knowledge
    to plan, develop, and facilitate such an event. It’s quite possible that no staff
    member has ever participated in a tabletop exercise before, whether with their
    current employer or in a past career. By contrast, individual members of a consultancy
    firm may execute 30 or more tabletop exercises a year and have the know-how to
    navigate potential roadblocks or hurdles. As a compromise, some organizations
    hire an external facilitator but treat the development process as an opportunity
    to also cross-train an internal employee for the next exercise.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Consultancy firms also tend to have expertise in specific areas. For example,
    one consultancy firm may specialize in incident response and another in payment
    card industry compliance. These external vendors can answer questions such as
    “How are we doing compared to our peers?” An external vendor who is a veteran
    at facilitating a large number of tabletop exercises across numerous organizations
    and industry verticals provides invaluable knowledge.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In some organizations, there is a culture of looking to outside experts for
    guidance. In these cases, the organization may be more inclined to act upon recommendations
    of an external vendor, even if employees have made similar suggestions in the
    past. Those employees can use this to their advantage by having the external consultant
    advocate for important changes. For example, if an information security director
    has asked to implement multifactor authentication and been rebuffed, an external
    consultant can weave this issue into a tabletop exercise and list it as an identified
    deficiency.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, the outsourced tabletop exercise could serve as a *third-party assessment*
    meant to provide an unbiased point of view. (To remove as much residual bias as
    possible, choose a consultancy with few or no business connections with the organization.)
    Third-party assessments are a powerful tool, as observations and recommendations
    are unlikely to be clouded by conflicting interests. Also, external stakeholders
    evaluating an organization’s information security posture may be suspicious of
    an internally conducted tabletop exercise that resulted in glowing reviews and
    few deficiencies. These third-party assessments are particularly salient to parties
    such as cyber insurance underwriters or auditors, who may even request copies
    of the documentation when assessing the risks of conducting business with the
    organization. Having proof of a tabletop exercise performed by a third party lends
    credibility to the report.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, if you choose to outsource an exercise to a vendor, make sure to find
    the proper fit with the consultant assigned to the exercise. If, for example,
    a premier US art museum hired an external vendor to perform a tabletop exercise,
    and during their first meeting, the consultant said, “You guys have a bunch of
    painted canvases made by starving artists, right?” In doing so, the consultant
    demonstrated a lack of appreciation for the artwork, which was immensely important
    to museum staff. A consultant should be able to fit seamlessly into the organization,
    quickly understand the rungs on the organizational ladder, and not prompt a collective
    facepalm from the group.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re using an outside consultant to avoid dedicating too many internal
    resources to a tabletop exercise, be sure to ask about the consultant’s development
    methodology, including how much time and what activities will be required of internal
    staff members. It’s unlikely that they’ll need to assemble the development team
    from the organization’s staff, but a good consultant should solicit feedback from
    employees to ensure that the scenario they’re developing is pertinent and meets
    the exercise’s goals and objectives. If an outside consultant requires several
    hours of the organization’s time to brainstorm scenarios, review deliverables,
    assist with revisions, and so on, the relationship may not realize the intended
    value, but someone showing up with a canned scenario that has nothing to do with
    the organization or its business may be even worse.

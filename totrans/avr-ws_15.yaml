    in this book, you should have the understanding, knowledge, and confidence you

    able to apply AVR technology to solve all sorts of problems, and have fun at the
    same time! (For a little inspiration, revisit the examples of more advanced projects
    in [Chapter 1](nsp-boxall502581-0011.xhtml#ch01) .)

			<p class="ChapterIntro">The events most likely to upend our lives aren’t of the kind that occupy the headlines and send ripples throughout the world; most of the time, they don’t even warrant a passing mention on the local news. Quiet and intimate hardships, from losing a job to getting injured in a car wreck, profoundly affect millions of people every year, yet they’re almost never given any serious consideration in publications dealing with disaster preparedness.</p>
			<p>
				This is unfortunate, and not just as a matter of probabilities. Such uninspiring but familiar events, recounted firsthand by our friends and relatives, provide the most grounded and tractable way to bootstrap a personal response-and-recovery plan. Even the most rigorous strategy preoccupied with supervolcanoes and cosmic weather is, at the end of the day, just a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_10" title="10"/>work of speculative fiction. In contrast, a plan that draws lessons from the plight of a coworker impacted by layoffs is quite likely to survive a collision with reality.</p>
			<p>It’s true that many of these everyday disasters aren’t a matter of life and death. Most car accidents are survivable, and most folks who experience unemployment eventually turn their life around. However, recovery can involve months or years of stress, pain, and regret. A strategy that minimizes the likelihood of such outcomes—or improves the outlook when they do occur—is worth its weight in gold.</p>
			<p>With this in mind, it feels prudent to kick off a more in-depth discussion of specific hazards with a stroll through the catalog of such humdrum emergencies that seldom keep us up at night until they actually come to pass. For the time being, I’ll try not to dwell on precise mitigation strategies or response plans; such a discussion will be much easier once we have a definite list of problems to tackle, and when all the commonalities snap into view.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c02-0001">Unemployment and Insolvency</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">The specter of financial ruin is perhaps the most universal fear in all developed nations around the globe. That’s because money is, in turn, the most universal way to solve other problems in life.</p>
			<p>
				There are countless ways to end up in financial trouble. In the United States, a major cause is medical debt,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c02-endnote-1" id="c02-noteref-1">1</a></sup> although this point is often overstated in political discourse: medical bills are a common compounding factor, but are usually not the sole cause and often not the dominant one.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c02-endnote-2" id="c02-noteref-2">2</a></sup> In any case, in the United States and everywhere else, bitter divorces, legal disputes, and failed investments contribute to a good portion of the misery too.</p>
			<p>
				In all the countries I’ve visited or lived in, one thing is constant: we have normalized heavy, lifelong debt burdens—be it mortgages, student loans, or credit card balances that we can’t seem to be able to repay. Without straying into social commentary, this means that even a brief bout of unemployment—perhaps as short as two to three months—can be enough to saddle a typical middle-class family with unpaid bills. In a highly cited 2015 survey published by Bankrate.com, about two-thirds of Americans indicated they didn’t have enough savings to cope with an unexpected expense of $1,000.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c02-endnote-3" id="c02-noteref-3">3</a></sup></p>
			<p>
				Although the findings of that study are also sometimes overstated by commentators, the underlying problem is real. During the 2007–2009 housing crisis (a comparatively mild recession next to some of the earlier crashes of the 20th century), the number of foreclosures in the United States exceeded 1.6 million,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c02-endnote-4" id="c02-noteref-4">4</a></sup> with a peak at more than five times the normal annual rate. Part of this involved investors or house flippers purposefully walking away from underwater nonrecourse mortgages, but part involved genuine tears and pain.</p>
			<p>
				When it comes to the ability to withstand downturns, high income is not as much of a benefit as many expect. Countless Silicon Valley tech <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_11" title="11"/>workers collect cozy salaries of $150,000 or more but still live paycheck to paycheck. When the job market dried up overnight in 2007, the number of evictions and foreclosures looked pretty gloomy down here too.</p>
			<p>Higher cost of living played a role, but so did the phenomenon of lifestyle creep: the tendency to scale up small, everyday purchasing decisions in proportion to one’s income. For Silicon Valley techies, it usually wasn’t the Lamborghini or the McMansion that did them in. It was the hundreds of small purchases where they reached for the upper shelf in the grocery store, indulged in geeky hobbies, and upgraded their phones and laptops every year. The fall from grace proved to be very sudden too. The unemployment benefits might’ve been just enough to pay the bills of a frugal low-income family, but fell well short of the mortgage payments on a mid-range San Francisco Bay Area home.</p>
			<p>It’s also important to remember that not all economic hardships start and end with money. Tech and many other white-collar professions employ many foreign nationals who must navigate labyrinthine bureaucracies every time they want to change employers, and who can’t stay unemployed for more than a couple of weeks without violating conditions of their visa, risking dire consequences down the road. To add insult to injury, the immigration landscape can change overnight. In the wake of the September 11 attacks in the United States, the processing of routine adjustment-of-status applications ground to a halt and didn’t go back to normal for almost two years.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c02-0002">Loss of Shelter</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">A roof over one’s head is one of the most essential needs, and of all the bare necessities, it’s usually the hardest and most expensive to replace. Financial hardships aside, about the most common way to lose shelter is a house fire, with around 350,000 instances recorded every year in the United States.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c02-endnote-5" id="c02-noteref-5">5</a></sup> The bulk of such fires start in the kitchen, where unattended cooking frequently goes awry when we’re in another room entertaining guests or browsing the internet. Other common causes include dryer vents that get clogged with lint, malfunctioning fireplaces, faulty wiring, and space heaters or candles that tip over. In any case, whether it’s fire, flooding, backed-up sewage, or an unhinged landlord, such situations can leave you with nothing but PJs on your back and no obvious place to go.</p>
			<p>Home or renter insurance is seen as a way to dispel any worries, but it’s important to understand all the carve-outs. Many policies protect you against only specific named perils, and often require you to pay extra to cover the types of events insurers see as more likely in your area. Just as important, insurance claims take time. Although you might be able to get expedient reimbursement for temporary lodging, even in the best case, it may take a month to get the final settlement—and then many months to rebuild.</p>
			<p>
				As with many other risks, a robust financial safety net can take care of many concerns, but so do other, more easily implemented measures, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_12" title="12"/>such as being on good terms with family members, friends, or coworkers, and agreeing that you can crash at each other’s place in an emergency. Another simple strategy is having some bare necessities—clothing, cash, documents—stowed away at your workplace or another secure location not far from home.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c02-0003">Loss of Basic Utilities or Transportation</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Outages are a fact of life. Over 30 million people lose power in the United States in a typical year,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c02-endnote-6" id="c02-noteref-6">6</a></sup> with some events dragging on for days or even weeks, depending on the nature of the damage and the priorities of the utility company. The causes are usually not cataclysmic nor particularly sinister; squirrels account for orders of magnitude more power outages than computer hackers do.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c02-endnote-7" id="c02-noteref-7">7</a></sup></p>
			<p>In most cases, an outage is more inconvenient than dangerous, but the situation can deteriorate quickly. For example, the loss of water pressure might make it impossible to flush the toilet, while the loss of heating in the middle of a winter storm—or of air conditioning in the midst of a heatwave—can be a deadly threat to the vulnerable and the unprepared. Subtle interdependencies need to be kept in mind too; for instance, many gas-fired furnaces and water heaters, and even some gas stoves and gas fireplaces, won’t function when the electricity is out. Similarly, for rural folks who depend on well water, the loss of electricity means the loss of water pressure after a couple of flushes afforded by the pressure tank.</p>
			<p>In practical terms, a day-long outage is far more likely than a week-long one, and a week-long one is far more likely than a month-long event. It pays to structure your analysis accordingly. Figuring out the implications of losing water for three days is more useful than pondering the socioeconomic dynamics of a world forever plunged back into the dark ages.</p>
			<p>Beyond the usual meaning of utilities, it’s good to consider the risk of disruptions to any other infrastructure we depend on in our daily lives. For some folks, especially those working remotely, the internet may be one such utility. For others, some aspects of the transportation infrastructure may be a choke point. For example, the 2013 Colorado floods took out quite a few small bridges and rural roads. Having a public bridge rebuilt by the county simply takes a long time, but damage to a private car bridge leading to a rural parcel or a subdivision means you may have to pay $50,000 to $100,000 out of pocket—or get used to wading across every time you need to get groceries or go to work.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c02-0004">Unintentional Injury</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Accidental injury is an awkward topic to discuss. We almost always think of it as something that happens to others, not to us, usually through some fault of their own. We make exception for the occasional freak accident—a “one-in-a-million” happenstance—but such matters aren’t worth dwelling on or worrying about.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_13" title="13"/>The statistics from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tell a startlingly different tale: accidental injury is the leading cause of death for people between the ages of 1 and 45—far ahead of cancer, heart disease, gun violence, and many other dangers more firmly rooted in the public consciousness. In total, unintentional injuries account for around 25 million ER visits and 170,000 deaths in the United States every year.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c02-endnote-8" id="c02-noteref-8">8</a></sup> Most involve prosaic, everyday activities: overdoses of over-the-counter or prescription medication, falls, cuts, burns, and car accidents.</p>
			<p>I suspect an element of survivor bias in the way we reason about injury. Every now and then, we all make a haphazard lane change or climb a rickety ladder or an office chair, and we escape unscathed, so we infer that, on balance, such activities must be safer than they truly are. The perception of risk is probably also skewed by childhood memories, as this is when we suffered most of our falls and other mishaps of this variety. Needless to say, falling when you’re 50 pounds and have lightning reflexes is a very different affair compared to falling when you’re 180 pounds and no longer have the youthful edge.</p>
			<p>More than for many other topics discussed in this chapter, most effectual approaches to managing the risk of unintentional injury involve changing everyday habits rather than trying to respond to a disaster that’s already in motion. To illustrate, although there’s some merit in having first-aid supplies and knowing how to use them, the most bang for your buck may be in properly securing your ladder before trying to pull that Frisbee off the roof.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c02-0005">Theft, Harassment, and Intentional Harm</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Intentional harm is essentially <em>normal.</em> According to surveys conducted by a little-known government agency by the name of the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the annual rate of criminal victimization currently hovers a bit under 1 percent a year,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c02-endnote-9" id="c02-noteref-9">9</a></sup> which translates to a lifetime probability in the vicinity of 30 to 40 percent.</p>
			<p>To be fair, this mathematical approximation doesn’t tell the whole story, as it’s not a uniformly distributed phenomenon; for one, young men are far more likely to get into an altercation than any other group. It also needs to be said that many incidents are an indignity more than a life-or-death situation—many assaults may amount to being shoved, slapped, spat on, or groped—but in the end, physical violence is far more common than it might seem. And because being assaulted is a dynamic situation that can quickly spiral out of control, well-rehearsed situational awareness and robust de-escalation skills are key to reducing this risk.</p>
			<p>
				Whereas intentional harm is merely a possibility, property crime crosses into the realm of events that, on a lifetime basis, are more likely than not. Annually, property crime affects around 10 percent of all households, spanning anything from porch piracy and minor vandalism all the way to burglaries of cars and homes. For burglaries, the vast majority are of the smash-and-grab variety, with losses averaging a bit over $2,500, as noted in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 1">Chapter 1</span>; so, being a victim can be painful but is seldom a life-changing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_14" title="14"/>event. That said, many simple strategies can reduce the likelihood or magnitude of loss, starting with remembering to always lock all windows and doors—no matter the vibe of the neighborhood.</p>
			<p>Beyond physical violence and property crime, another distinct challenge is harassment. Simply getting into an online argument with a deranged individual can escalate to being doxxed, swatted, or stalked at work. Causes such as bitter breakups or business disputes can lead to similar outcomes.</p>
			<p>
				Reliable statistics on harassment are difficult to come by, in part because of the nebulous nature of the term, encompassing anything from unwelcome criticism to frightening sexual threats. Focusing on just some of the more severe manifestations of this phenomenon, an older 1998 survey conducted by the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control indicated that roughly 8 percent of women and 2 percent of men experienced stalking at some point in their lives.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c02-endnote-10" id="c02-noteref-10">10</a></sup> Not all of this can be anticipated or prevented, but a few basic steps—such as carefully managing one’s online footprint and removing personal information from major data brokers—can go a long way.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c02-0006">Illness and Death</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">As with unintentional injury, death is a subject that’s all too easy to dismiss. It’s distant, unknowable, and feels entirely outside our control. In some respects, this attitude makes sense: we can’t predict the day or the method, so worrying about the end has little merit and brings no joy.</p>
			<p>At the same time, however, this thinking overlooks an important consideration: the people who depend on us to care and provide for them—be it our minor children, elderly parents, or stay-at-home spouses. In that sense, death planning doesn’t have to be about choosing a casket and buying a burial plot; it’s more about setting up your finances in a way that doesn’t leave your survivors stranded for months.</p>
			<p>Ordinarily, when you die, your assets are placed under probate—a court-supervised process of reconciling assets and liabilities and identifying heirs—and remain there until disposed of in accordance with your wishes or the normal operation of law. In some jurisdictions, simple probate cases that involve just your spouse and a modest estate can be wrapped up reasonably quickly, but at other times, the proceedings can take a year or more. Family disputes or mysterious disappearances can make the process drag out even longer.</p>
			<p>
				Many financial advisors would try to sell you on the idea of setting up a living trust, a separate legal entity that holds your assets and disposes of them in a prescribed way in the event of your death. But this is a costly and involved solution that sometimes makes people throw their hands up in the air and give up. Luckily, simpler alternatives—such as having a joint tenant bank account or designating a named beneficiary—can achieve pretty solid results. (We’ll cover wills, trusts, and other financial planning topics in Chapters <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_7">7</span> and <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_13">13</span>.)</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_15" title="15"/>Of course, it’s not just about money. For example, it’s important to write down your wishes regarding the custody of any minor children. The courts aren’t required to listen to you, but they usually do, especially if you make a well-reasoned case. Thinking this through and discussing your ideas with the potential caretakers helps avoid the prospect of having children placed in foster care—or worse yet, with an abusive and dishonest relative.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c02-0007">But Wait, There’s More!</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">The list of disasters named in this chapter is meant as a starting point; it may well be incomplete when you consider your family situation, medical needs, and other circumstances unique to you. For instance, if you provide day-to-day care for a disabled person, any scenario that could jeopardize your ability to visit them, even for a brief while, is worth thinking about. Conversely, if you depend on the care or goodwill of others, anything that gets in the way of this relationship should be discussed in advance, along with any alternative arrangements that could be made.</p>
			<p>With all this in mind, now would be a good time to grab a piece of paper or open a blank document and try to jot down some initial notes about the scenarios that don’t involve large-scale disasters but could still mess up your life. Instead of relying on TV tropes, make it about you, your family, your relatives, and your career. If you make a list, hang on to it. It’s going to be very useful later on.</p>

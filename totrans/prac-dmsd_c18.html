			<p class="ChapterIntro">Energy may be important to our lives, but compared to water, food, and sanitation, it’s not urgent. In the short haul, we can typically make do just fine without electricity, gasoline, or natural gas. Shielding yourself from the occasional inconvenience caused by temporary outages or fuel crises is possible, but hatching elaborate plans of this nature usually doesn’t make much sense. It costs far more to keep the appliances humming along through a week-long power outage than it would to throw out the spoiled contents of the fridge once in a blue moon.</p>
			<p>
				In some situations, this assertion doesn’t hold true, of course. Fridges filled to the brim with fine caviar notwithstanding, a more solemn example is a family that depends on lifesaving medical equipment that must remain <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_154" title="154"/>plugged in at all times, or that needs to preserve perishable medications for everyday use. But in the general case, the payoff for whole-house generators or off-the-grid energy storage just isn’t there, making the pursuit of energy independence an interesting hobby for the affluent but an ill-advised expense for the average Joe.</p>
			<p>With the prices of batteries and solar panels coming down every year, this will eventually change. Until then, let’s have a look some of the more cost-efficient ways of dealing with a disruption to discretionary energy needs while stuck at home.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c18-0001">Keeping the Lights On</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">During power outages, illumination tends to be the most pressing need. We’re used to staying up well past sunset, and it’s hard to change habits at the drop of a hat. Just as important, even during the day, many homes lack sufficient natural light in areas such as bathrooms, closets, attics, or basements.</p>
			<p>Some families still take the traditional route of keeping candles in case of an emergency, but in this day and age, it’s an unnecessary fire risk. Battery-powered flashlights are a much more practical choice; alkaline batteries cost as little as 20 cents apiece in bulk, can be stored for 5 to 10 years, and a pair of AAs can deliver 100 hours of illumination with ease. Without delicate lightbulbs to burn out or shatter, modern flashlights are also a lot more durable than the technologies of old.</p>
			<p>When buying flashlights for emergencies, it’s important to note that more lumens don’t automatically mean a better purchase. In most situations, there’s no need for retina-searing beacons that light up the sky and chew through a crate of batteries a day. Indoors, as little as 10 to 20 lumens is enough for most household work. Outside, around 200 lumens is sufficient to scout the backyard or go on a night hike. Only the owners of larger rural properties may benefit from 1,000 lumens or more—and that’s only for investigating disturbances hundreds of yards away.</p>
			<p>It should also be noted that the traditional handheld form factor isn’t always the right choice. Carrying a flashlight ties up one of your hands and gets in the way of many household chores. For reading, dining, or cooking, omnidirectional lanterns that can be set on the table or on the counter are more convenient. Headlights are fantastic too, although they have the disadvantage of blinding whoever is standing right in front of you—so while they’re well liked by their users, they might not always win acclaim from other family members or friends.</p>
			<p>
				Spare batteries for flashlights and other electronics should be stored in a dark, cool, and dry place to maximize their shelf life. It’s preferable to keep alkaline cells out of any electronics that don’t need to be operational at a moment’s notice; this is because, no matter what the manufacturers promise, the batteries occasionally spring corrosive leaks of potassium hydroxide, damaging metal contacts and printed circuit boards in the device. If the equipment must be stored with batteries, it’s best to rely on <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_155" title="155"/>somewhat more expensive but leak-proof lithium cells. These are available in a variety of specialized sizes, such as 18650 or CR123, but also as retrofits for alkaline AA, AAA, and 9V (look for the Energizer Ultimate brand). Another option is to inspect and replace installed batteries regularly, as the likelihood of leaks increases with age. In this model, tossing out old batteries after one year in the device is best.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c18-0002">Powering Small Electronics</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">In the midst of an outage, it helps to be able to connect with friends or relatives, to follow local headlines, and to get timely updates from the utility company. In <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 22">Chapter 22</span>, we’ll look at what to do if conventional communication networks fail, but in most cases, the obstacles to staying in touch with the rest of the world aren’t as profound. The nearest cell tower or the telco office may have backup power, or may be outside the outage area to begin with. Under such circumstances, having a way to recharge a phone or a laptop, or a method to power a router, may be all you need to get online for your daily fix of funny cat videos and people getting angry at each other on Twitter or Facebook.</p>
			<p>As might be expected, countless power-generation solutions are marketed to survivalists. From hand-crank generators to folding solar cells, the reliability and performance of these products tends to be poor. Instead of spending money on gimmicks, for those who own a vehicle, the most straightforward option is to recharge any battery-powered equipment from the accessory socket in the car. The method isn’t particularly efficient, but in most cases, it’s perfectly adequate: the vehicle’s battery alone has enough juice to keep a typical phone charged for weeks. Turning on the engine can extend the run time considerably too, depending on how much fuel you have in the tank.</p>
			<p>Of course, a quick recharge session is one thing, but idling the car for days to power a router becomes a wasteful affair. For devices that need to be plugged in continuously, a popular alternative is lithium-ion power stations, invariably made in China and available on the US market under at least a dozen ephemeral brands. But this technology has a gotcha: the affordable units usually pack very little juice—maybe 200 watt-hours, barely enough to power a typical laptop for one afternoon, or a microwave for about 10 minutes or so.</p>
			<p>High-capacity units are better, but can cost south of $1,000, so for avid DIYers, a more economical option is to buy a regular car battery, charge it fully, and then pair it with a basic 120V inverter whenever the need arises. Such a rig should provide around 800 watt-hours for under $200; it also can be trivially extended by adding more batteries. The only real disadvantage is that lead-acid car batteries weigh a ton, so it’s not an option on the go.</p>
			<p>
				Still, there are limits to what can be done by stashing batteries around the home, no matter if they’re alkaline, lead-acid, or lithium-ion. For more substantial or longer-term needs, a small gasoline-powered generator is the best choice; such generators can provide around 5,000 to 6,000 watt-hours <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_156" title="156"/>per gallon of gas. As with power stations, countless options are available on the market, but because a generator is a fairly complex and somewhat dangerous piece of equipment, it’s probably best to stick to reputable brands. Honda EU2200i and Yamaha EF2000iS are considered to be the best of the best. Cheaper generators branded by Champion, Westinghouse, and Generac have a good reputation for their quality assurance as well.</p>
			<p>
				If you decide to buy a portable generator, fuel storage deserves some thought. In most situations, keeping around 10 to 15 gallons is the sensible maximum that’s unlikely to attract the wrath of authorities<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c18-footnote-1" id="c18-footnoteref-1">*</a></sup> or cause serious problems in the event of a leak. But even with this modest quantity, you should take care not to create undue fire risks. Gasoline vapors are heavy and can travel considerable distances, so the fuel needs to be stored in suitable containers, in a place with good airflow, and far from any sources of ignition—including water heaters, washers and dryers, and other appliances commonly found in or near the garage. Where possible, it’s best to investigate outdoor storage in a backyard shed or other detached structure; proper metal cans are preferable to cheap plastic jugs too.</p>
			<p>Gasoline does deteriorate over time but does so mostly when in contact with oxygen and moisture. This is why it’s important to follow the manufacturer’s instructions for draining a generator after every use (and why small gas-powered lawn tools, such as weed wackers, are notoriously unreliable when pulled out of storage after a couple of months).</p>
			<p>On the other hand, gasoline that’s stored in properly closed, full containers tends to stay good longer than urban legends dictate. To avoid problems caused by moisture, it’s best to use ethanol-free gas in states where this option is available at the pump. Oxidation can be limited with fuel stabilization preservatives such as STA-BIL or PRI-G. With these precautions taken, fuel can easily be stored for a year or more—although it’s still wise to rotate it every now and then, most simply by putting it in your car’s fuel tank. It’s best to do this when the tank isn’t completely empty; mixing it with fresh gas minimizes the chance of any hiccups on the road, however unlikely that may be.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c18-0003">Staying Warm</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">When the power is out, your usual way of heating the home may stop working. This may sound worse than it is. Cold weather can be a serious hazard to people stranded outdoors, but in the safety of your abode, serious harm due to the loss of heating is rather unlikely—provided you have adequate food and clothing on hand. Even in extreme situations, covering windows with some insulating material and then huddling in a single room tends to be enough. Thermal underwear, a warm hat, and a bunch of extra blankets may be about the most important winter preps to have.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_157" title="157"/>On the flip side, braving the cold isn’t the only concern when the utilities are out. If the temperature inside the house drops below freezing for a longer while, the water in the pipes may freeze and cause the piping to burst. A simple work-around is to leave the taps slightly open, allowing somewhat warmer water from the main to continuously flow through the pipes. Even if the liquid eventually freezes, the slow trickle may relieve some of the pressure and disrupt crystal formation. In single-family homes, it’s also possible to preemptively shut off the water and drain the system by opening a low-lying tap, although losing running water is seldom a good deal.</p>
			<p>The water used in certain types of closed-loop heating systems can be a bit more of a nuisance. To avoid trouble, some homeowners opt to add inhibited glycol to their hydronic systems or indirect water heaters. The glycol depresses the freezing temperature of the mix, making this a worthwhile endeavor in some settings, especially in regions where outdoor temperatures frequently drop below 10°F. Draining the system during prolonged outages may be a last-resort option too—although this takes the heating out of commission until refilled and properly purged of air.</p>
			<p>Because of the risk to indoor plumbing posed by subfreezing temperatures, it’s good to have alternative sources of heat. Some houses, especially in cold climates, may be equipped with two or more independent heat sources, such as a gas fireplace and electric baseboards. For homes without an adequate backup, inexpensive indoor-safe units, such as the propane-powered Mr. Heater, can bridge the gap. These heaters can be operated from disposable 1-pound camping cylinders—or, with the correct hose, from a standard 15- to 20-pound propane tank commonly used for backyard grills (although bringing such a cylinder indoors should be a measure of last resort). Of course, any portable heater needs to be used with the utmost care and kept well clear of flammable items. Adding a battery-powered carbon-monoxide detector is wise too.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c18-0004">Staying Cool</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">The loss of air-conditioning during a power outage may seem like a less serious worry, but surprisingly, heat waves kill far more people than the cold. This is because in most situations, managing heat exhaustion is more difficult than staying warm. The warning signs of a heat stroke are also far less obvious. To avoid trouble on exceptionally hot days, hydration should be watched closely. As noted in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 15">Chapter 15</span>, as many as four to eight quarts of water a day may be needed to offset losses due to sweating, and we don’t always have a strong instinct to drink more. Eating much less than usual is beneficial too, as it tends to slow metabolism and gives our bodies more headroom to regulate body temperature.</p>
			<p>
				When we’re hot, we usually enjoy standing in a light breeze or in front of a fan. What’s less understood is that the principal cooling mechanism in this situation isn’t the motion of air, but the evaporation of sweat from our skin. Water takes a surprising amount of energy to evaporate, and the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_158" title="158"/>process can cool surfaces by 20°F or more. It follows that carrying a spray bottle filled with water to mist your skin, hair, or clothes can go a long way toward keeping you cool.</p>
			<p>
				When the humidity is sufficiently low, the same principle makes it possible to operate a <em>swamp cooler</em>: a simple electrical device consisting primarily of a fan and a water-soaked mat. Compared to real air conditioning, swamp coolers require little power and can be easily operated from a small generator or a larger power bank. But the gotcha is that they work well only if the humidity is below 40 percent or so; in humid climates, they do very little or even make the situation worse.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c18-0005">Cooking</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Your cooktop may be another casualty in a power outage—but in many cases, it may be wise to let it go. Cooking is a welcome addition to any preparedness plan, but only when it brings joy and simplicity, not when it’s an added constraint. In other words, your survival plans shouldn’t hinge on the ability to cook pasta or slow-simmer a steak, but might incorporate such activities as a way to brighten an otherwise dull and stressful day.</p>
			<p>With this in mind, the simplest way to cook during outages is to have a backup option that uses an energy source different from your regular stove. For owners of gas ranges, the solution may be a portable electric hot plate; for those with electric cooktops, the answer could be a propane- or butane-operated camping stove.</p>
			<p>As with power generation, many other alternatives are promoted by survivalists, but the pursuit of novelty usually makes little sense. Sterno cans, for example, are far less energy-dense than propane, while portable wood stoves are patently unsafe to use indoors—in part because of the amounts of smoke and carbon monoxide they produce.</p>
			<p>For many families, cooking outside is another option, but the drawbacks need to be carefully evaluated before settling on that plan. For one, outages often go hand in hand with unfavorable weather, so the merits of solar ovens should be called into question—and the same may go for fiddling with a grill in the middle of a storm. The efficiency of grills or campfires is much lower too, requiring that far more fuel be stored to achieve the same effect as a camping stove. In rural settings, firewood may be abundant, although it can be laborious to collect; in a typical suburb, on the other hand, trying to chop down a public tree may land you in jail, so being realistic about the available fuel sources is key.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c18-0006">Getting Around</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">It doesn’t take a global fuel crisis for gas stations to shutter. A simple power outage is enough to stop the pumps, with no practical way to move gasoline from the underground holding tanks. Alas, when it comes to transportation woes, there are no quick fixes. Especially in sparsely populated locales such as much of the United States, few alternatives to driving exist—and, as <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_159" title="159"/>discussed earlier, building a substantial stockpile of fuel carries pronounced legal and environmental risks. Having an off-the-grid, solar-charged electric vehicle is a common prepper dream that’s becoming more and more of a possibility for well-off families—but with a high five-figure price tag, it’s still a tough sell for most.</p>
			<p>For owners of gasoline-powered vehicles, the most pragmatic way to maintain mobility in a crisis is to get in the habit of always keeping the tank at least half full. Although this doubles the frequency of gas station visits, it’s a minor hurdle—especially given that the stops get shorter with less fuel to pump. The range afforded by this reserve of fuel can be safely incorporated into any evacuation plan.</p>
			<p>When driving isn’t an option—whether it’s because you don’t own a car, or are planning for a time when fuel might run out or roads may be impassable—a bicycle may be a worthwhile and inexpensive prep, at least on days when the weather is nice. Kick scooters or electric scooters can also work, provided that you live in a place without too many hills and with well-maintained roads. If you choose to go somewhere on foot, a beach cart can make it easier to haul any bulky items. For the most part, however, it’s best to assume that in a major disaster or fuel crisis, you won’t be able to travel much or go very far—and plan accordingly.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c18-0007">Looking Beyond Short-Term Outages</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">The approaches proposed in this chapter make sense in situations that are fairly transient and localized. In effect, we’re devising an approach for a week-long regional power outage, rather than a solar flare that takes out the entire power grid for months. This bias isn’t merely a reflection on probabilities; it stems from the observation that during a more profound cataclysm, energy challenges would no longer boil down to business-as-usual tasks such as keeping the lights on or reheating a meal.</p>
			<p>In a prolonged and global crisis, the widespread disruption to industrial production, municipal utilities, and food distribution would put other, more basic needs—like food and water—at the forefront of your strategy. Such needs wouldn’t be remedied by a solar panel or a tarp-covered barrel of gas. Instead, you’d have to go back to the basics, and rely on the supplies and strategies discussed in other parts of this book.</p>

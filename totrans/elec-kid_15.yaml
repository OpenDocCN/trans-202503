    designed to teach you a particular concept. In this chapter, you’ll combine all
    your new skills to build a reaction game. The game has a row of five LEDs that
    light up one at a time so that a light appears to run back and forth.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The goal of the game is to stop the light when it’s in the middle of the five
    LEDs. That gives you 10 points. If you stop it on an LED next to the middle one,
    you get 5 points. But if you stop it on one of the end LEDs, you lose all your
    points and have to start over from 0\. Try to reach 50 points!

    many friends as you want. If you’re competing with friends, I suggest giving each
    player only one attempt at stopping the light before the next player gets a turn.

    V[CC] was the voltage supplied to the collector side of a transistor in common

    collector is where the “CC” comes from.

    input pulses. Every time the clock input on pin 14 goes from low to high, the
    counter increments by one. It counts from 0 to 9, and it has 10 outputs marked
    0 to 9.

    is, pin 7) is high, and the other pins are low. If you connect an LED to output
    3, then when the counter is at three, the LED will turn on.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you connect LEDs to several output pins, then as the counter increases, the
    LEDs turn on in order, according to their output pins. When the counter is at
    9 and receives a 10th input pulse, it goes back to 0 and turns the output pins
    on in order again.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    pin 13 to tell the game when to start moving the light across the LEDs and when

    the LED doesn’t get destroyed. Because two output pins connect to each LED, the
    resistors keep the voltage to each LED high, even though one output will be low
    and one will be high. The resistors also ensure that two outputs aren’t connected
    directly together, which could damage the IC when one output is high and the other
    low.

    because that would short-circuit the battery and stop the game from working. Use

    Plug the black measurement lead into the multimeter’s COM socket, and plug the
    red measurement lead into the multimeter’s V socket. Touch the tip of the black
    and red measurement leads to each other, and you should hear a beep to indicate
    that there’s a direct connection.

    the battery. Touch one measurement lead tip to the positive connector and the
    other to the negative connector. If you hear a beep, there’s a short circuit,
    and you need to fix it! Check all your connections to the positive and negative
    supply columns.

    on the 4017 decade counter to make sure they’re connected correctly. Use the continuity
    tester to check that you have a connection by carefully touching the lead tips
    on the IC pins. There isn’t much space between IC pins, so take care to be sure
    each tip only touches the correct pin. This time, a beep is a good sign.

    the output voltage from the start/stop circuit to see whether it’s working correctly.
    Set your multimeter to measure voltage. Make sure the black measurement lead is
    connected to the multimeter’s COM socket, and the red measurement lead is connected
    to the V socket.

- en: Touch the tip of the black lead of the multimeter to the negative side of the
    battery, and touch the red lead to pin 11 on the 4011 NAND-gate IC. You should
    see a high signal—about 9 V—after clicking the stop button and a low signal—about
    0 V—after pushing the start button. If not, check the connections of the SR latch
    circuit to find the error.

- en: To change the speed and difficulty of the game, play around with different values
    for R1, R2, and C1 around the 555 timer. Smaller values will make the game go
    faster. Larger values will make the game go slower. Flip to “[How to Set the Output
    Speed of the 555 Timer](ch08.xhtml#ch08lev2sec02)” on [page 166](ch08.xhtml#page_166)
    for the calculations to figure out specific resistor and capacitor values based
    on the frequency you want. Note that R1 should not be less than 1 kΩ, as lower
    values might damage the 555 timer.

    R2 with a potentiometer. Then you can change that resistance value by rotating
    the potentiometer shaft, which changes the speed!

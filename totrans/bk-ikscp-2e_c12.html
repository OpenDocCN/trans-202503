			</header>
			<p class="ChapterIntro"><a id="223"/>In a typical vector drawing, an overwhelming majority of
objects are paths. That's why being familiar with paths is so important—otherwise, you
cannot really say you know
how to work in a vector editor. Inkscape provides a rich selection of tools, commands, and effects that work on
paths.</p>
			<p>
				I'll start with the basics of SVG paths and the traditional path tools whose
analogs you may have already seen in other software.  Then, in the second half of this
chapter and in the next, I'll describe the advanced Inkscape techniques for path
editing that are often more  efficient—and almost always more fun to use.  You
may find, for example, that the Tweak tool (<a href="#section12.6">12.6</a>) is so natural that you will rarely
need to resort to the more technical and low-level Node tool (<a href="#section12.5">12.5</a>).  Still, it is
important that you know what a path consists of and are able, when necessary, to
manipulate path nodes directly, as this is one of the cornerstones of vector
graphics of any kind.</p>

				12.1 <a id="224"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_224" title="224"/>The Anatomy of a Path</h2>
			<p>
				A path is a sequence of <em>nodes</em> (points) connected by straight or curved<em>segments</em> (<a href="#fig12-1">Figure 12-1</a>). Each node may have either one neighboring segment (if it's an end node) or two (if
it's a middle node); SVG does not support branching
paths with more than two segments joined at the same node.</p>
			<a id="fig12-1"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-nodes.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-1: Path = nodes + segments</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>The length of a path is not limited; it may have anywhere from two to many thousands
of nodes. It is also legal to have a path with one or even zero nodes, but such a path is
invisible.</p>
			<p>
				With a path, you can at least approximate (and in many cases, reproduce exactly) any
conceivable shape, form, or figure. Depending on the shape you need and the required
precision, in the worst case you'll just have to use many densely positioned
nodes (<a href="#fig12-2">Figure 12-2</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig12-2"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-approx.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-2: 
You can approximate the same figure roughly with a few nodes or reproduce it more precisely with more nodes.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<a id="section12.1.1"/>
			<h3>12.1.1 Subpaths</h3>
			<p>
				In a path, a pair of nodes  that are adjacent in sequence may not be connected by a segment. This
produces a gap in the path, and each such gap divides the path into disconnected parts
called <em>subpaths</em>, as shown in <a href="#fig12-3">Figure 12-3</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig12-3"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-subpaths.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-3: Subpaths  are groups of connected nodes
within a path.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="225"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_225" title="225"/>A path without any gaps is said to consist of a single subpath. Any subpath, just
like a piece of rope, can be <em>open</em> (with two loose ends, called <em>end nodes</em>)
or <em>closed</em> (tied into a loop, so that its end nodes are one and the same
node).</p>
			<p>
				In many respects, subpaths look and behave just like separate paths. You can always
convert the subpaths of a path into independent path objects by using the <span class="ui">Break Apart</span>
command in the <span class="ui">Path</span> menu. The opposite command, <span class="ui">Combine</span>, converts
several selected paths into subpaths of a single path.</p>
			<p>When combining paths with different styles, you will lose the styles of all
but the topmost (in z-order) selected path—because  a single path, with no matter how
many subpaths, can only have a single style. However, path data is never lost or
added: if you combine and then break apart any number of paths, no nodes are changed in any way.</p>
			<p>
				Every subpath has a <em>direction</em>—that is, its nodes are always ordered from start
to end. In a closed subpath, the start node and end node are the same node; in
an open subpath, the start and end nodes are different. Usually, the direction of a subpath does
not matter; situations where it matters include using the start and end markers (<a href="c09.xhtml#section9.5">9.5</a>)  and text on a path
(<a href="c15.xhtml#section15.2.4">15.2.4</a>). The direction may also affect the fill of the path via the fill rule (<a href="#section12.1.2">12.1.2</a>).
You can visualize path direction in the Node tool if you enable path outline (<a href="#fig12-17">Figure 12-17</a>) and,
in the tool's <span class="ui">Preferences</span>, turn on the <span class="ui">Show path direction on outlines</span> checkbox.
Use <span class="ui"><strong>Path<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Reverse</strong></span> (Shift-R) to flip the direction of the selected paths (or, when
in the Node tool, of the subpaths with selected nodes).</p>
			<a id="section12.1.2"/><h3>12.1.2 Filling  Paths</h3>
			<p>
				No matter what you use to fill your path—solid color, gradient, mesh, or pattern
(<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.2">8.2</a>)—there are several important things to be aware of.</p>
			<p>
				Fill always stops at the path itself—that  is, at the  centerline of the path's
stroke, if it has any.  Closed subpaths that do not intersect themselves or other
subpaths are simply filled on the inside. Open subpaths are filled as if there were a
straight line segment between the end nodes of the subpath, as shown in <a href="#fig12-4">Figure 12-4</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig12-4"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-fill.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-4: Filling open and closed subpaths</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				This straight line is not part of the path—it is not stroked, and
you cannot, for example, bend it with the Node tool. If, when editing an open  nonstroked
path, you run into a straight line segment that refuses to be edited as you expect
it to, most likely it's not really a segment but simply an edge of the fill. Close the
subpath (<a href="#section12.5.4">12.5.4</a>) to  edit it without  limitations.</p>
			<p><a id="226"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_226" title="226"/>When a path intersects itself or when one subpath is completely inside another, the
decision on whether to fill some area depends on two factors: the <em>directions</em> of
the subpaths surrounding the area and the <em>fill rule</em> of the path. The
fill rule is a style property that can take one of two values, <code>nonzero</code> or<code>evenodd</code>, as set by one of the two toggle buttons in the <span class="ui">Fill and Stroke</span> dialog
(<a href="c08.xhtml#fig8-3">Figure 8-3</a>):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					When the fill rule is <code>evenodd</code>, holes and loops are always left unfilled,
except when you have a hole within a  hole—then the inner hole becomes an island of
fill.</li>
				<li>
					When the fill rule is <code>nonzero</code>, a loop or hole is filled only
if its boundary is <em>counterdirected</em> relative to the outer path; it is empty if they 
go in the same direction.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				With the fill rule of <code>nonzero</code>, those loops and holes that are filled
are invisible unless the path is stroked. Usually they are not a problem, but
sometimes you may want to get rid of them. The easiest way to do this is to select that
one path and use the <span class="ui">Path<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Union</span>  command (Ctrl-+). Unioning a path
with itself removes all subpaths that do not affect its fill.</p>
			<p>
				To reverse a path, use <span class="ui"><strong>Path<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Reverse</strong></span> (Shift-R); if you want
to reverse the direction of a subpath inside a path, use the Node tool to
select one or more nodes in that subpath and then press Shift-R, which will
apply only to the subpaths with selected nodes (if no nodes are selected, all subpaths
are reversed).</p>
			<a id="section12.1.3"/><h3>12.1.3 Stroking Paths</h3>
			<p>
				The <em>stroke</em> of a path is a strip of paint that goes along the path itself, 
so that the path marks the <em>centerline</em> of the stroke. The stroke is normally painted on top of the fill,
if there is any, but you can change that (<a href="c09.xhtml#section9.6">9.6</a>). The many
style properties that affect the look of a stroke are covered in detail in<a href="c09.xhtml#ch9">Chapter 9</a>.</p>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Path<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Stroke to Path</span> command  (Ctrl-Alt-C) converts the
stroke of the selected path(s) to fill, as shown in <a href="#fig12-5">Figure 12-5</a>. In other words, it replaces a stroked path with a new path
whose <em>fill</em> looks the same as the original path's <em>stroke</em>, honoring
all the join, cap, miter, and dash properties of that stroke. The stroke paint of the
original becomes the fill paint of the new path, and the original path's fill is
discarded. If the original path had markers (<a href="c09.xhtml#section9.5">9.5</a>), the result will be a group where
the stroke converted to path is grouped with markers that are now separate objects.</p>

			<h3>
				12.1.4 <a id="227"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_227" title="227"/>Bézier Curves</h3>
			<p>
				As already mentioned, segments—parts of a path between the nodes—can be either
straight or curved. Let's have a closer look at those curved segments—called <em>Bézier curves</em> after Pierre Bézier (1910-1999), a French engineer who was the first to use them in design.</p>
			<p>
				A Bézier  curve is completely determined by the position of four points, two of which
are the <em>nodes</em> and two others are the <em>handles</em>, or controls. The curve
itself is always completely inside the quadrilateral of these four points. In the Node tool (<a href="#section12.5">12.5</a>),
each handle is connected to its node by a straight  line. These <em>handle
lines</em> are always tangential to the curve at the corresponding node, as shown in <a href="#fig12-6">Figure 12-6</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig12-6"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-bezier.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-6: Bézier curves</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>If a path node is between two Bézier  curve segments, it will have two
handles connected to it, one for each adjacent segment.</p>
			<p>The way a Bézier curve reacts to moving its handles is hard to describe, but you
will quickly get a feel for it once you try. A Bézier  curve may be
indistinguishably close to a circular  arc, but it may also have sharp bends, almost
cusps; it may  self-intersect or be perfectly straight when the handles are on the line between the nodes (or fully
retracted).</p>
			<p>
				Of course, for all its versatility, not many shapes are possible with a <em>single</em> Bézier curve.
When building a path to approximate something (for example, when manually tracing over a
bitmap, <a href="c18.xhtml#section18.5.2">18.5.2</a>), experience will tell you how far you can reach with the current Bézier 
segment and where the best place for the next node is. Forcing a path to more closely approximate
some real-life shape usually involves subdividing its Béziers  by adding nodes and
adjusting their handles.  In contrast, simplifying a path, either manually or with the<span class="ui">Simplify</span> command (<a href="#section12.3">12.3</a>), usually reduces the number of nodes and results in longer
Béziers.</p>
			<a id="section12.2"/><h2>
				12.2 <a id="228"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_228" title="228"/>Boolean Operations</h2>
			<p>
				British mathematician George Boole (1815–1864) didn't specialize in geometry. He
invented his <em>Boolean algebra</em> for dealing with the logical values of "true" and
"false." Later, however, it was discovered that the same concepts make perfect sense for
various other mathematical objects, such as sets or arbitrary geometric shapes.</p>
			<p>
				Inkscape supports a number of Boolean operations on paths. They are accessed from the <span class="ui">Path</span> menu
or by keyboard shortcuts derived from the symbols of the corresponding mathematical operations.
Some of them require exactly two objects to be selected; others will work on any number of selected shapes.
All of them will accept not only paths but also text objects and shapes (except 3D boxes), automatically converting them to paths. If a
Boolean operation fails (for example, due to a wrong number or type of selected 
operands), it will explain the reason in the status bar.</p>
			<a id="section12.2.1"/><h3>12.2.1 Union</h3>
			<p>
				The <em>union</em> of two or more paths (Ctrl-+) creates a path that covers, with its
fill, every point that any of the original paths covered. It thus joins any number
of paths into a single path, giving it the style of the bottommost selected object, as shown in <a href="#fig12-7">Figure 12-7</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig12-7"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-union.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-7: Unioning paths</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				If the paths do not overlap, the result will be exactly the same as for<span class="ui">Path<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Combine</span> (<a href="#section12.1.1">12.1.1</a>). However, if the paths do overlap, this command, unlike<span class="ui">Combine</span>, will never create any holes; it will create new nodes where the paths
intersect and remove any parts of the path that would
end up inside the fill of the resulting path.</p>
			<p>
				For example, if a small circle is completely inside a bigger circle, a <span class="ui">Union</span> of those two circles will simply remove the smaller inner circle. If you
want the smaller circle to become a hole in the larger one, use <span class="ui">Difference</span>
(<span class="ui">Combine</span> will also work unless the resulting path has the fill rule of <code>nonzero</code> and
the two circles happen to be counterdirected, <a href="#section12.1.2">12.1.2</a>).
Still, the <span class="ui">Union</span> command makes sense even for a single selected path, as it allows you
to quickly clean up the path of any inner parts that do not affect the fill.</p>
			<a id="section12.2.2"/><h3>
				12.2.2 <a id="229"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_229" title="229"/>Difference</h3>
			<p>
				The <em>difference</em> of two paths (Ctrl-–) creates a path
whose fill covers all points that were covered by the bottom (in z-order) path but not
the top one—in other words, it <em>subtracts</em> the top from the bottom. The result
has the style of the bottom object, as shown in <a href="#fig12-8">Figure 12-8</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig12-8"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-difference.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-8: Subtracting a path from another
path</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				If the paths do not overlap, <span class="ui">Path<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Difference</span> simply deletes the top path;
if the top path completely overlays the bottom path, the result will be blank (both objects
are deleted and nothing is selected). This
command is the primary tool for creating holes and erasing the parts of paths you
don't need.</p>
			<p>
				The Calligraphic pen (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.2">14.2</a>) <em>unions</em> the new path it creates with the selected one
when you draw with Shift and <em>subtracts</em> from it when you draw with Alt. In the Eraser tool (<a href="c14.xhtml#section14.4">14.4</a>),
one of the modes also subtracts what you draw from the selected paths or shapes.</p>
			<a id="section12.2.3"/><h3>12.2.3 Intersection</h3>
			<p>
				The <em>intersection</em> of two or more paths (Ctrl-*) creates a
path whose fill covers only those points that were covered by <em>all</em> original paths.
It uses the style of the bottommost selected object for the result, as shown in <a href="#fig12-9">Figure 12-9</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig12-9"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-intersection.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-9: Intersecting paths</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				If at least two of the selected paths do not overlap (that is, their intersection
is empty), <span class="ui">Path<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Intersection</span> deletes all paths without creating
anything. This command is similar to clipping one path with another (<a href="c18.xhtml#section18.3">18.3</a>), except
that a clipping path is nondestructive and works on any object, not just on paths; on
the other hand, <span class="ui">Intersection</span> can intersect any number of paths at once.</p>
			<a id="section12.2.4"/><h3>
				12.2.4 <a id="230"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_230" title="230"/>Exclusion</h3>
			<p>
				The exclusion of two overlapping paths (Ctrl-^) creates
a path whose fill covers the points that were covered by <em>only one</em> of the original
paths. It uses the style of the bottom object for its resulting path, as <a href="#fig12-10">Figure 12-10</a> demonstrates.</p>
			<a id="fig12-10"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-exclusion.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-10: Excluding a path from another path</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				When the two paths do not overlap, the result of <span class="ui">Path<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Exclusion</span> is
exactly the same as that of <span class="ui">Path<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Combine</span>. When they do overlap, the result<em>looks</em> exactly like a <span class="ui">Combine</span>, but the actual path is different: it has new nodes
in the points where the outlines of the original paths intersect, whereas <span class="ui">Combine</span>
creates no new nodes.</p>
			<a id="section12.2.5"/><h3>12.2.5 Division</h3>
			<p>
				A <em>division</em> of two paths (Ctrl-/) cuts the bottom path
into pieces by the top path, deleting the top path, as shown in <a href="#fig12-11">Figure 12-11</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig12-11"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-division.svg.png"/>

			</figure>
			<a id="section12.2.6"/>
			<h3>12.2.6 Cut Path</h3>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Cut Path</span> operation (Ctrl-Alt-/) is similar to<span class="ui">Division</span>. The main difference is that <span class="ui">Cut Path</span> does not create any new nodes or segments
along the cut line, thus leaving the resulting paths unclosed. It also removes any fill
of the path being cut. It is natural to use <span class="ui">Division</span> for slicing filled paths
and <span class="ui">Cut Path</span> for cutting stroked paths without fill, as shown in <a href="#fig12-12">Figure 12-12</a>.</p>

			<h2>
				12.3 <a id="231"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_231" title="231"/>Simplifying</h2>
			<p>
				An important operation on paths is <em>simplifying</em>. When you simplify a path
(<span class="ui">Path<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Simplify</span> or Ctrl-L), Inkscape attempts to redraw that path
using fewer nodes, ironing out smaller details but preserving the large-scale features
of the path. If this description sounds a bit vague, it's because the
operation itself is not entirely deterministic; usually, it is difficult to predict
the result of simplifying accurately before you try it. Even the reduction of the
number of nodes is not guaranteed (although common).</p>
			<p>Despite that, simplifying is a very common operation and a true lifesaver for certain styles
of artistic drawing. In technical drawing, on the other hand, it is rarely useful—if
only because it considers any sharp corners in a path as "defects" to be smoothed out.</p>
			<p>
				One effect you can almost always count on is that if your path has
nodes that can be deleted without <em>any</em> change in the shape of the path, they<em>will</em> be deleted by simplifying. This includes any nodes you added with the
Node tool (<a href="#section12.5.3">12.5.3</a>) or with the <span class="ui">Add Nodes</span> extension (<a href="c13.xhtml#section13.4.2.1">13.4.2.1</a>) but never moved from their
initial positions.</p>
			<p>
				Path simplification is similar to gradient simplification in the Gradient
tool, also invoked by Ctrl-L (<a href="c10.xhtml#section10.5.1">10.5.1</a>). Gradient simplification also
removes any gradient stops that you added but didn't yet move from their initial
positions.</p>
			<p>
				Every simplification operation uses a certain <em>force</em>. Weak simplification changes
the path just a little, removing only the most obviously redundant nodes. Stronger
simplification changes the path more and smooths out larger bumps on it.</p>
			<p>
				The default force used when you press Ctrl-L <em>once</em> can be set as
the <span class="ui">Simplification threshold</span> value on the <span class="ui">Behavior</span> page of the <span class="ui">Preferences</span> dialog. The default is 0.002; anything greater than 0.01 is probably too strong for most
cases. If you change it at all, consider lowering this value, because it is
actually the <em>minimum</em> simplification force; you can always temporarily strengthen
your <span class="ui">Simplify</span> command, raising this value without going into the<span class="ui">Preferences</span> dialog.</p>
			<p>
				How do you make <span class="ui">Simplify</span> stronger? Just press Ctrl-L several times in quick
succession (in <a href="#fig12-13">Figure 12-13</a>). Each invocation of the command increases the force a little, provided it
happened less than half a second after the previous invocation. With such <em>accelerated
simplification</em>, you can apply just the amount of simplification you need for each
path. If the first keystroke didn't smooth the path enough, just keep pressing
Ctrl-L, and it will gradually pick up. If you wait <a id="232"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_232" title="232"/>more than half a second,
though, the simplification force is reset back to the default value as set in <span class="ui">Preferences</span>.</p>
			<a id="fig12-13"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-simplify.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-13: Simplifying paths</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a href="#fig12-13">Figure 12-13</a> shows some examples of how simplification affects paths (see also <a href="#fig12-2">Figure 12-2</a>, which was produced by gradual simplification of the most
node-rich rose silhouette). As you can see,
apart from reducing the number of nodes and ironing out small details, this operation
melts sharp corners and curves straight lines, producing a natural—and often
artistically engaging—kind of distortion.</p>
			<a id="section12.4"/><h2>12.4 Offsetting</h2>
			<p><em>Offsetting</em> a path means expanding or contracting it in such a way that each point
moves perpendicular to the path in that point. Offsetting inward is called<em>insetting</em>, and offsetting outward is <em>outsetting</em>. Imagine that your
path is an island; outsetting would enlarge it by moving every point of the 
shoreline the same number of steps seaward, and insetting would make it smaller by allowing
the sea to encroach inland by the same number of steps everywhere, as shown in <a href="#fig12-14">Figure 12-14</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig12-14"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-offset.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-14: Offsetting paths</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="233"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_233" title="233"/>To inset the selected path or paths, press Ctrl-(
(inset by 2 px), or  Alt-( (inset by 1 screen pixel at the current
zoom), or Shift-Alt-( (inset by 10 screen pixels).  To
outset a path, use the ) key with the same modifiers. On most keyboards, the
9 and 0 are on the same keys as ( and ), so
the digits will work the same as the parentheses.</p>
			<p>Offsetting is used in situations where you want to make a path "bolder" or
"thinner" without changing its overall shape. This is useful for shadows, outlines,
halos, bevels, and the like. (Sometimes, instead of outsetting you can simply set a
wide enough stroke on the path, colored the same as its fill.)</p>
			<p>
				If you outset and inset a path several times, it becomes distorted in a
characteristic way,
similar but different from the distortion of simplification
(<a href="#section12.3">12.3</a>). Such distortion welds together parts of a path—rounding corners, smoothing
the intersections, and fusing together close subpaths within a path. For example,
union all brush strokes in a Calligraphic pen drawing, and do a few inset/outset cycles on it to
make it appear more natural and worn-down (<a href="#fig12-15">Figure 12-15</a>).</p>

			<p>
				Offsetting, just like simplification, is a destructive operation: you cannot
restore the exact original path except by undoing it. (For one thing, offsetting an
open path always closes it.) However, Inkscape also has two dynamic object types,<em>linked offset</em> and <em>dynamic offset</em>, which store the exact original path and
let you adjust the amount of offsetting without accumulating distortion (<a href="c13.xhtml#section13.3.11">13.3.11</a>).</p>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Inset</span> and <span class="ui">Outset</span> commands, as well as the linked and dynamic offsets,
apply the same offset distance to the entire path. It is possible, however, to inset or outset just a part of a path (for
example, one end of a calligraphic brush stroke) using the Tweak tool's Grow and Shrink
modes  (<a href="#section12.6.4">12.6.4</a>).</p>
			<a id="section12.5"/><h2>12.5 The Node Tool</h2>
			<p>Like everything else in Inkscape, the Node tool—the second button from the top in the main toolbar, accessible by
pressing N or F2—strives to make
simple things easy and hard things possible. This may be the most complex of all Inkscape
tools—at least, the number of keyboard and mouse shortcuts in the Node tool is greater than in any other tool.
You don't need to know all of its tricks in order to use Inkscape efficiently, but you should know the basics.</p>
			<a id="section12.5.1"/><h3>
				12.5.1 <a id="234"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_234" title="234"/>Path Display</h3>
			<p>
				After you switch to the Node tool, any selected path displays its <em>nodes</em> as
little gray squares, diamonds, or circles (depending on the type of each node, <a href="#section12.5.5">12.5.5</a>).
As a bonus, shapes (<a href="c11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11</a>), gradients, meshes, and patterns (<a href="c10.xhtml#ch10">Chapter 10</a>), as well as many of the path effects (<a href="c13.xhtml#ch13">Chapter 13</a>), also display
their editing handles in the Node tool.</p>
			<p>
				You can <em>select</em> some or all of the path nodes; a selected node becomes blue and slightly larger.<em>Handles</em> of Bézier curves (<a href="#section12.1.4">12.1.4</a>) are visible only for selected nodes and their
neighbors. Even then, you can suppress these handles, if they get in the way, using a button on the controls bar, as shown in <a href="#fig12-16">Figure 12-16</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig12-16"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-node-handles.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-16: Nodes and Bézier handles in the Node tool</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The selected paths are not, by default, visualized in the Node tool other than by showing their nodes.
Normally, you would watch the path's stroke and/or fill update live in response to editing the nodes.
Sometimes, however, your path may be too transparent or blurred, or may have some path effect (<a href="c13.xhtml#ch13">Chapter 13</a>) applied;
in that case, you can ask Inkscape to highlight the actual path with a red line by toggling another button on the
controls bar (<a href="#fig12-17">Figure 12-17</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig12-17"/><figure>

				</div>
				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>
						You can change the color of the highlight from the default red for each object individually, using the <span class="ui">Objects</span> dialog (<a href="c04.xhtml#section4.9.5">4.9.5</a>).</p>

			</aside>
			<p><a id="235"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_235" title="235"/>Apart from the path itself, the Node tool allows you to edit some other paths associated with an object—they are invisible but affect the way the path looks:
the clipping path (shown as light green, <a href="c18.xhtml#section18.3">18.3</a>), the mask path (shown as blue, <a href="c18.xhtml#section18.3">18.3</a>), and the linked path parameters
of a path effect (shown as dark green, <a href="c13.xhtml#section13.2.1">13.2.1</a>). These correspond to the three buttons
on the control bar; the clipping path and mask buttons are on/off toggles, but the<span class="ui">Show next editable path effect parameter</span> button
switches to the <em>next</em> linked path parameter (as there may be more than one, depending on the effect used).</p>
			<p>
				Finally, as already mentioned, the Node tool displays all kinds of editing handles that objects (not necessarily paths) have. 
For example, in this tool you can edit your shapes (<a href="c11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11</a>), adjust gradients, meshes, and patterns (<a href="c10.xhtml#ch10">Chapter 10</a>),
or change the dimensions of a flowed text object (<a href="c15.xhtml#section15.2.2">15.2.2</a>).</p>
			<a id="section12.5.2"/><h3>12.5.2 Selecting Nodes</h3>
			<p>
				Like so many other things in Inkscape, a path's nodes can be <em>selected</em>
when in the Node tool. Not surprisingly, node selection methods are quite similar to those for object selection (<a href="c05.xhtml#ch5">Chapter 5</a>).</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>
						Unlike gradient handles (<a href="c10.xhtml#section10.4.2">10.4.2</a>), you can't style selected path nodes.
Only the path as a whole can have a style, not its nodes.</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>
				Along with selecting nodes in paths, the tool can also select objects (remember that object selection is common to all tools
and commands in Inkscape). In the Node tool, you can use some of the shortcuts you know from the Selector tool: clicking
selects an object (ignoring grouping), Shift-clicking adds to selection or removes from selection,
and Alt-clicking selects under (<a href="c05.xhtml#section5.9">5.9</a>). The Node tool can edit nodes in multiple selected
paths simultaneously (in many ways, it treats them as subpaths of a single path, <a href="#section12.1.1">12.1.1</a>).</p>
			<p>
				This is similar with nodes. To select a single node in a selected path, just click it; the node becomes blue and
slightly larger than a gray unselected node. Shift-click <em>adds</em> a node
to the node selection; selected nodes need not be adjacent or even on the same path.
Rubberband selection (dragging a rectangle around nodes, compare <a href="c05.xhtml#section5.7">5.7</a>)
also works; dragging with Shift adds nodes inside the rubberband to 
the selection.</p>
			<p>If you click a path segment between two nodes, both nodes will be
selected. Clicking an empty space (away from selected paths), just as pressing Escape,
deselects any selected nodes—or, if there are no selected nodes, deselects any selected objects.</p>
			<p>
				The Tab and Shift-Tab keys, which in the Selector tool go to
the next or previous object, in the Node tool select the next or previous node on the selected path or paths.
When the last node is reached, pressing Tab jumps to the first node; when the
first node is reached, pressing Shift-Tab jumps to the last node. By the way,
pressing Tab a couple times is a quick way to figure out the <em>direction</em> (<a href="#section12.1.1">12.1.1</a>)
of a (sub)path without changing the document in any way.</p>
			<p>
				Also like in the Selector tool, Ctrl-A selects all nodes in all selected paths.
However, if you already have some nodes selected, Ctrl-A selects only the nodes<em>in those paths and subpaths</em> that have selected nodes (this is similar to the way <a id="236"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_236" title="236"/>Selector's
Ctrl-A selects objects only within the current layer). To always select
all nodes in all paths, use Ctrl-Alt-A. The ! key <em>inverts</em> selection
by selecting what was not selected and vice versa within the (sub)paths that already have some nodes selected.</p>
			<p>
				Yet another method of selecting nodes is unique to the Node tool. As you hover your
mouse over a node (which is then highlighted red), you can <em>expand</em> or <em>contract</em> node selection by rotating
your mouse wheel or pressing the Page Up and Page Down
keys. Rotating the wheel <em>up</em> one notch or pressing Page Up adds the <em>closest</em>
unselected node to the selection; rotating the wheel <em>down</em> one notch or pressing
Page Down deselects the <em>farthest</em> selected node.</p>
			<p>
				To determine the "closest" and "farthest" nodes, Inkscape measures the direct Euclidean distance from each node to the mouse pointer.
However, if you hold Ctrl while rotating the wheel or pressing Page Up or Page Down, the
distance will be calculated <em>along the path</em> and the selection will be limited to the (sub)path over whose node you are hovering.</p>
			<a id="section12.5.3"/><h3>12.5.3 Deleting and Creating Nodes</h3>
			<p>Deleting any number of selected nodes is as easy as pressing Delete or
Backspace or clicking the "minus" button on the controls bar.</p>
			<p>
				Deleting an end node of a subpath makes the subpath shorter, but you cannot open a
closed subpath by deleting nodes—you'll need to <em>break</em> it as described in <a href="#section12.5.4">12.5.4</a>.</p>
			<p>
				When deleting mid nodes (those between other nodes), Inkscape replaces each group of
adjacent nodes being deleted with a single Bézier curve segment. In most cases, this introduces
some distortion, but Inkscape tries to minimize it—it adjusts the handles on the remaining
nodes so that the new Bézier segment runs as close as possible to the path fragment it replaces. In other words, deleting 
nodes on a path may work like a local <span class="ui">Simplify</span> command (<a href="#section12.3">12.3</a>).</p>
			<p>
				Sometimes, however, you don't need a new Bézier to bulge out all the way to ghost
the nodes you're deleting, as you're trying to avoid changes to the handles of the remaining nodes.
In that case, simply press Ctrl-Delete or Ctrl-Backspace, as shown in <a href="#fig12-18">Figure 12-18</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig12-18"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-node-delete.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-18: Deleting nodes</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Unlike deletion, <em>inserting</em> new nodes is always possible in any point of a path
without changing its shape. Simply double-click or Ctrl-Alt-click
on the path (that is, on the center line of the stroke or the edge of the fill) where you want the
new node to be. A new node is inserted, and the handles of its neighbor nodes are
automatically adjusted so that the shape of the path remains unchanged (<a href="#fig12-19">Figure 12-19</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig12-19"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-node-create.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-19: Creating a node by clicking</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="237"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_237" title="237"/>There is another node creation method that does not require clicking. Select two or more
adjacent nodes and press Insert or Shift-I (or click the <span class="ui">Insert node</span> button on the controls bar)
to insert a new node in the <em>middle</em> of each path segment (<a href="c09.xhtml#fig9-11">Figure 9-11</a>). Since the new nodes are then added to the selection,
this is a quick way to multiply the number of nodes on a path—for example, if you start
with two nodes and press Insert eight times, your path will have 257 nodes (2<sup>8</sup>
+ 1). This is similar to creating new gradient stops by pressing Insert (<a href="c10.xhtml#section10.5.1">10.5.1</a>).</p>
			<p><span class="NoteHead">[1.1]</span></p>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Insert node</span> button on the controls bar has a drop-down submenu of commands that insert new nodes
at the <em>extremities</em> of the path or its selected part—but only if that extremity doesn't already
have a node. For example, if you select two nodes with a curve between them that reaches lower (that is, further down on the Y axis)
than either of the two nodes, you can use the <span class="ui">Insert node at max Y</span> command to insert a node
at the lowest point of this segment (<a href="#fig12-20">Figure 12-20</a>). All nodes in extremities will be smooth nodes (<a href="#section12.5.5">12.5.5</a>)
with strictly horizontal (for min/max Y) or strictly vertical (for min/max X) handles.</p>
			<a id="fig12-20"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-node-extremities.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-20: Inserting nodes at the extremities of a path</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Yet another approach is <em>duplicating</em> nodes. With any number of nodes selected,
press Shift-D. This "divides" each selected node into two, each inheriting one of the two
handles of the original node. <a href="#fig12-21">Figure 12-21</a> shows how it looks if you duplicate all nodes in a path and move away
the new nodes (originally in the same locations as the old) by pressing →.</p>
			<a id="fig12-21"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-node-duplicate.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-21: Duplicating nodes</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The Shift-D method is especially useful for continuing an open
(sub)path by duplicating and moving away its end node. For example, if you select an end
node of a straight line segment (that is, an end node without a Bézier handle), <a id="238"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_238" title="238"/>you can easily
"draw" with line segments: just keep pressing Shift-D followed by arrow keys.</p>
			<a id="section12.5.3.1"/><h4>
				12.5.3.1 Copying, Cutting, and Pasting Nodes <span class="NoteHead">[1.1]</span></h4>
			<p>
				The traditional <span class="ui">Copy</span>, <span class="ui">Cut</span>, and <span class="ui">Paste</span> commands and shortcuts work on nodes in the Node tool,
although with limitations.</p>
			<p>Copying a single node does nothing useful. Copying two or more selected nodes creates a path out of those nodes and places
it on the clipboard. From there, if you're in the Selector or in any other tool, you can paste it back as a new path object created
out of the copied subset of nodes. If you copy less than a complete closed subpath, the pasted path will be open.</p>
			<p>
				If you paste a node selection copied from the Node tool in the same tool with a single path selected, you create a new subpath (<a href="#section12.1.1">12.1.1</a>)
in the selected path.
It doesn't matter if any nodes are selected when you do the paste, because pasting doesn't insert the copied nodes between the existing nodes.
It always creates a separate subpath, and depending on the fill rule (<a href="#section12.1.2">12.1.2</a>), this action may produce holes in the fill.
While that may be useful, incorporating the nodes into the path and not having a separate subpath sometimes makes more sense.
To do that, exit the Node tool, paste the copied nodes as a path of their own, position that path as needed, and union it with your target path.</p>
			<a id="section12.5.4"/><h3>12.5.4 Joining and Breaking</h3>
			<p>
				To <em>join</em> two end nodes, first select them. These can be the end nodes
of the same open subpath, in which case joining them will close that subpath. Or they
can belong to different subpaths, in which case you will join these subpaths into
a single subpath. They can also belong to different path objects, in which case
these objects become one path (and take the style of the path that was selected
first).</p>
			<p>
				There are two ways to join, corresponding to the two join buttons on the Node
controls bar. The first method—the <span class="ui">Join nodes</span> button or 
Shift-J—actually moves and joins the two end nodes into a single node.
The second method—the <span class="ui">Join with segment</span>
button—leaves the end nodes where they are but adds a new path segment between
them. If you use the first method but don't want one of the end nodes to
move, hover your mouse over it to lock its position while pressing
Shift-J (<a href="#fig12-22">Figure 12-22</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig12-22"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-node-join.svg.png"/>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="239"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_239" title="239"/>Similarly, there are two ways to <em>break</em> a path. For the first method, select
one or more non-end nodes and click the <span class="ui"><strong>Break nodes</strong></span> button or press
Shift-B. This will duplicate each selected node but without connecting it to
the original node, so the path will be broken into subpaths at each selected node point. For the
second method, select two adjacent nonend nodes, and click the <span class="ui"><strong>Delete segment</strong></span> button
to delete the segment between them, as shown in <a href="#fig12-23">Figure 12-23</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig12-23"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-node-break.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-23: Breaking nodes and deleting segments</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Cutting an open path with any of these methods produces new subpaths within a path (<a href="#section12.1.1">12.1.1</a>). If you want to break a path into independent objects,
first break it into subpaths and then use <span class="ui"><strong>Path<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Break Apart</strong></span> to separate each subpath into a path
object of its own.</p>
			<a id="section12.5.5"/><h3>12.5.5 Node Types</h3>
			<p>
				A mid node may have one or two handles attached to it, one for each side.
In Inkscape, a node can belong to one of several <em>node types</em> that behave differently
when you drag one of these handles or the node itself (<a href="#fig12-24">Figure 12-24</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig12-24"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-node-types.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-24: Node types: cusp, smooth, half-smooth, symmetric, and auto-smooth</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<ul>
				<li>
					If a node has no handles (they are both <em>retracted</em>), or if one handle is noncollinear (not on the same straight
line) with the opposite handle or segment, or if one handle remains 
unmoved when you drag the other one, such a node is called <em>cusp</em>—because
when its two controls are at an angle, the node represents a sharp turn (cusp) in the
path. Cusp nodes are shown as diamond shapes.</li>
				<li>
					If the other handle rotates so as to always be collinear with the handle you're moving, such a node is called <em>smooth</em> because it
keeps the path flowing smoothly. Smooth nodes are shown as squares.</li>
				<li>
					The node may have only one handle, with a Bézier curve on one side but a straight line segment on the other,
and the only handle of the node may be <em>locked</em> to be always collinear with the line segment—so that, when you drag the node,
its handle automatically rotates to remain collinear. Such a node is called <em>half-smooth</em>; it is also shown as a square, but unlike other node types,
it doesn't have its own button or shortcut. To make a node half-smooth, convert a segment 
between two smooth nodes to a straight line with the <a id="240"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_240" title="240"/><span class="ui"><strong>Make selected segments lines</strong></span> button (<a href="#section12.5.6.1">12.5.6.1</a>) 
or simply retract the inner handles on the segment's nodes (their outer handles will line up with the segment and the nodes will become half-smooth).
You can also convert a cusp node with one handle,
adjacent to a straight line, to smooth (Shift-S) <em>once</em> to make it half-smooth; another smoothing will make it fully smooth with two handles.</li>
				<li>
					The other handle of a smooth node may rotate and scale so as to always be both collinear and
have the same length as the control you're moving. Such a node is called <em>symmetric</em> because its handles are always symmetric around it. Symmetric nodes are
also shown as squares.</li>
				<li>
					An auto-smooth node, shown as a circle, is a smooth node that adjusts
its handles automatically when you move it around. You should not manually edit the handles of an auto node;
if you do, the node will downgrade itself from auto-smooth to smooth. It is best, if you use auto nodes, to hide the handles
altogether using the controls bar button (<a href="#fig12-16">Figure 12-16</a>) so they don't get in the way.
					<p>
						An auto-smooth node adjusts the angle and length of its handles so as to make the adjacent
path segments as smooth as possible. If the adjacent nodes are also auto-smooth, their handles
will adjust, too. For example, when you move an auto-smooth node A closer to
its neighboring auto-smooth node B, both nodes will make their handles progressively shorter and rotate them toward
each other so as to keep the curvature of the segment between them, as well as of the
adjacent segments on both sides, at a minimum. This behavior is reminiscent of the <span class="ui">Spiro spline</span> path effect (<a href="c13.xhtml#section13.3.7.2">13.3.7.2</a>).</p>
			</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To change the type of node in a cycle (cusp to smooth to symmetric to auto-smooth and back
to cusp), Ctrl-click it.  To change the type of several selected nodes, click
one of the node type buttons on the controls bar or use the keyboard shortcuts:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Press Shift-C to make the selected nodes cusp. The first Shift-C just
changes the node type but does not move the handles; a second Shift-C retracts all handles of selected nodes.</li>
				<li>
					Press Shift-S to make the selected nodes smooth.
If the previously cusp node had non-retracted handles, they will be rotated
to be collinear; if its handles were retracted, they will be pulled out and made collinear at an angle
that minimizes the curvature.
					<p>
						If a node has a straight line segment (<a href="#section12.5.6.1">12.5.6.1</a>) on one side but a handle on the other,
the first Shift-S will make it half-smooth, locking the single handle to the direction of the line segment.
Another Shift-S will extend the second handle, making the node fully smooth.</p>
			</li>
				<li>Press Shift-Y to make the selected nodes symmetric.</li>
				<li>Press Shift-A to make the selected nodes auto-smooth.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Switching all nodes of a path from cusp to smooth or auto-smooth distorts the path in a
characteristic way, removing straight lines and sharp corners, as <a href="#fig12-25">Figure 12-25</a> demonstrates.</p>
			<a id="fig12-25"/><figure>

			<h3>
				12.5.6 <a id="241"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_241" title="241"/>Moving Handles</h3>
			<p>
				Perhaps the easiest way to edit a Bézier path segment is by
dragging not a node or handle but the curve itself. This does not require any nodes to
be selected nor does it move any nodes. Inkscape simply adjusts the Bézier handles of the
two adjacent nodes so that the curve follows your mouse, as shown in <a href="#fig12-26">Figure 12-26</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig12-26"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-node-curvedrag.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-26: Curve dragging</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>If a node is smooth or symmetric, dragging the curve on one side of that node
will also change the curve on its other side, because the movement of one of the node's
handles will be mirrored by its other handle. Curve dragging next to an auto-smooth node
converts the node to smooth.</p>
			<p>
				Of course, you can also drag the Bézier handles of any selected node
(if you don't see the handles, check that you have the <span class="ui">Show handles</span> button pressed on
the controls bar, <a href="#fig12-16">Figure 12-16</a>).
Although they are shown only for selected nodes and their neighbors on the path,
handles themselves (unlike nodes) are not selectable.
As you drag a handle, Inkscape's status bar reports the total displacement as well as the current angle and length of the handle.</p>
			<p>With Ctrl pressed, the handle you're rotating snaps to 15-degree increments. With
Shift pressed, the other handle of the same node rotates by the same amount, preserving the angle between handles
(as is always the case for smooth nodes; with Shift, however, this works for cusp nodes too). With Alt, you
lock the length of the handle, so that only its angle changes. These modifiers work in any combination.</p>
			<p>
				It is also possible to move node handles using keyboard shortcuts. In <a href="#section12.5.7.3">12.5.7.3</a>, you'll see that the
&lt; and &gt; keys scale and that [ and ] rotate
several selected nodes as if they were an object. Logically, when you have a <em>single</em> node selected,
these same keys rotate and scale (that is, change the length of) the Bézier handles of that node
without moving the node itself, as shown in <a href="#fig12-27">Figure 12-27</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig12-27"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-node-handlekeys.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-27: Adjusting node handles with keyboard shortcuts</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				With Alt, you can even scale and rotate each of a node's handles separately. Just use the <em>left</em> one
out of the two Alt keys on your keyboard to scale (with &lt; and &gt;) or
rotate (with [ and ]) the <em>left</em> handle of the single selected node—that <a id="242"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_242" title="242"/>is, the
handle whose end is farther to the left than the other one. The right Alt will similarly affect the right handle.</p>
			<a id="section12.5.6.1"/><h4>12.5.6.1 Segment Types</h4>

				What if you want to flatten a Bézier curve by converting it to a straight line segment?
Actually, a straight line is just a Bézier curve with both its handles<em>retracted</em>—that is, coinciding with the corresponding nodes. To retract a handle,
Ctrl-click it; to pull a retracted handle out of a node,
Shift-drag it away from that node.</p>
			<p>
				Another way to convert Bézier curves to lines—and back—is by using the 
segment type buttons on the controls bar. These buttons require that at least two
adjacent nodes are selected, but they will work on any number of segments between
selected nodes. The <span class="ui">Make segment line</span> button (or Shift-L)
retracts any pulled-out handles; the <span class="ui">Make segment curve</span> button (or
Shift-U) does not actually make the segment curvilinear, but it pulls out the handles
and puts them along the segment, so you can move them manually, as shown in <a href="#fig12-28">Figure 12-28</a>.</p>

			<h3>12.5.7 Moving Nodes</h3>
			<p>Reshaping a path is as easy as selecting some of its nodes and dragging them around.
The Bézier handles belonging to those nodes move parallel with them (except
for half-smooth and auto-smooth nodes, which may rotate their handles as you drag them).</p>
			<p>
				As in the Selector, simple click-and-drag works as expected for moving a single<em>unselected</em> node; if you drag a selected node, you're dragging <em>all</em> selected
nodes with it. With Ctrl pressed, mouse dragging is restricted to moving horizontally and
vertically.</p>
			<p>
				Arrow keys move selected nodes in the same way and by the same distance as in the
Selector tool (<a href="c06.xhtml#section6.5.1">6.5.1</a>): by 2 px (default value) without modifiers, by 10 times that distance
with Shift, by 1 screen pixel with Alt, and by 10 screen pixels
with Shift-Alt.</p>
			<p><a id="243"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_243" title="243"/>If you drag a node while pressing Ctrl-Alt, movement is restricted
to the directions of the dragged node's Bézier handles and their perpendiculars. If a node has a straight line segment on
one side, then the direction of that segment is taken instead of a handle. So, if the
node's two handles or adjacent segments are collinear, you can Ctrl-Alt-drag
it in one of four directions; otherwise, you can drag it in one of eight directions (<a href="#fig12-29">Figure 12-29</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig12-29"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-node-ctrlalt.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-29: Directions of dragging a node with Ctrl-Alt</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>You can Ctrl-Alt-drag more than one selected node, but
the movement will be restricted to the handles/segments of the node you actually
drag with your mouse.</p>
			<p>
				The nodes you drag with the mouse may snap (<a href="c07.xhtml#section7.3.1.2">7.3.1.2</a>)
to guides, grids, and other objects or nodes. By default, snapping to guides and grid
is enabled, but snapping to objects is not. You can temporarily disable
snapping if you drag with Shift.</p>
			<a id="section12.5.7.1"/><h4>12.5.7.1 Moving Nodes Numerically</h4>
			<p>
				The coordinates of a single selected node are displayed in the <span class="ui">X</span> and<span class="ui">Y</span> fields in the Node tool's controls bar (<a href="#fig12-30">Figure 12-30</a>); editing those values
moves the selected node to the new coordinates.</p>
			<a id="fig12-30"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-node-xy.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-30: Using the X and Y editable fields to 
position nodes</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				If you have more than one node selected,
these fields show their <em>average</em> coordinates—or, to put it another way, the
coordinates of the geometric center of the selected nodes. In this case, typing a value
in one of these fields moves the selected nodes as a whole so that their center takes
the new coordinate value.</p>
			<p>
				You can also line up selected nodes using a tool you have already seen used for
objects: the <span class="ui">Align and Distribute</span> dialog (<a href="c07.xhtml#section7.4">7.4</a>). When you are in the Node tool, this dialog
displays the <span class="ui">Nodes</span> section whose four buttons allow you to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Align the selected nodes horizontally.</li>
				<li>Align the selected nodes vertically.</li>
				<li><a id="244"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_244" title="244"/>Distribute the selected nodes equispaced on X.</li>
				<li>Distribute the selected nodes equispaced on Y.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				For aligning nodes, the <span class="ui">Relative to</span> drop-down list lets you choose the reference point of the alignment. For example,
if you're aligning selected nodes vertically—in a column—you can choose whether that column will be in the <span class="ui">Middle of selection</span>
(the default), at the <span class="ui">Min value</span> (at the left edge), at the <span class="ui">Max value</span> (at the right edge), or at the location of the <span class="ui">First selected</span>
or <span class="ui">Last selected</span> node.</p>
			<a id="section12.5.7.2"/><h4>12.5.7.2 Node Sculpting</h4>
			<p>
				Simple dragging moves all selected nodes by the same distance, which often
is what you need. For example, in a schematic face profile (<a href="#fig12-31">Figure 12-31</a>, left),
you can easily make the nose longer by selecting two nodes and pulling them to
the right—the result is acceptable for this style of drawing. However, what if
you have a more complex and realistic drawing with lots of nodes (<a href="#fig12-31">Figure 12-31</a>, right)?
No matter how many nodes you select, dragging them will introduce discontinuities
and damage the natural silhouette of the face.</p>
			<a id="fig12-31"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-node-noses.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-31: Pulling two noses</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				In such cases, it would be nice to be able to move different nodes by different
distances so that the tip of the nose moves the farthest and the other nodes move less and
less as you go along the path away from the tip. That is exactly what Inkscape does when
you select all the nose's nodes and drag the tip node with Alt. This technique is
called <em>node sculpting</em>.</p>
			<p>
				In the simplest case, when all selected nodes are on the same straight line,
Alt-dragging the middle selected node bends the path into a smooth bell-like
curve.  Farthest selected nodes stay put; the dragged node moves all the way; and all other
selected nodes move by some intermediate distance.  Now, if your selected nodes formed a
wiggly line, text converted to path, or a realistic nose, Alt-dragging will
smoothly bend them while preserving their features (<a href="#fig12-32">Figure 12-32</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig12-32"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-node-sculpt.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-32: Sculpting nodes with Alt</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="245"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_245" title="245"/>When determining what nodes to move by what distances while Alt-dragging, the
distance from the node being dragged is calculated along a straight line (spatially), not
along the path.</p>
			<p>
				If you don't have enough nodes on the part of a path you want to sculpt,
just select the nodes you have and press Insert a few times to populate
that part of the path with nodes. When sculpting complex shapes with many densely packed nodes, such as
bitmap tracings (<a href="c18.xhtml#section18.5">18.5</a>), hide their Bézier handles (by unpressing the button on
the controls bar) so  they don't get in the way, and select nodes by expanding
selection from a node (<a href="#section12.5.2">12.5.2</a>).</p>
			<p>
				Node sculpting is reminiscent of the Tweak tool (<a href="#section12.6">12.6</a>) in that it makes path
editing more natural and lets you develop complex shapes out of simple ones. However,
unlike Tweak, this technique does not create or delete nodes—and it's more
deterministic overall. Repeated Tweaking of a complex sprawling path
will eventually simplify and degrade all of it, melting away small details even where you
don't touch them with the tool. With node sculpting, on the other hand, only selected nodes are affected,
and no degradation occurs no matter how many times you Alt-drag the selected
nodes back and forth.</p>
			<a id="section12.5.7.3"/><h4>12.5.7.3 Transforming Nodes</h4>
			<p>
				What does <em>transforming nodes</em> mean? You already know many ways to move nodes around and even sculpt them. How is this different?</p>
			<p>
				Remember that with the Selector tool, <em>transforming</em> includes not only moving but also
scaling and rotating (<a href="c06.xhtml#ch6">Chapter 6</a>). These kinds of transformations make perfect sense for a
group of nodes on a path as well—if you think of that group as an "object."</p>
			<p><span class="NoteHead">[1.1]</span></p>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Show transformation handles</span> button on the controls bar does just that: displays the eight scaling handles—exactly the same as in the Selector—around the selected nodes on the path (<a href="#fig12-33">Figure 12-33</a>). Also like in the Selector, if you click any of the selected nodes, the scaling handles switch to rotation/skewing handles and back (compare <a href="c06.xhtml#section6.3">6.3</a>). Most of the modifiers from the Selector tool also work: Ctrl-scaling to preserve ratio, Shift-scaling to scale around the center, and Ctrl-rotating to snap angle to 15-degree increments.</p>
				<a id="fig12-33"/>
				<figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-node-transform.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-33: Transforming selected noses</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="246"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_246" title="246"/>Transforming nodes is also available via keyboard shortcuts.
Just as in the Selector, the &lt; and &gt; keys scale the selected
nodes, and the [ and ] keys rotate them as a whole. Without
modifiers, rotation is by 15-degree increments and scaling is by 2 px; the same keys
with Alt pressed rotate and scale by 1 screen pixel at the current zoom.  The
H
and V keys for flipping (reflecting) horizontally and vertically
also work.</p>
			<p>By default, keyboard scaling, rotation, and flipping are performed around the geometric center of
the selected nodes. However, if you hover your mouse cursor over one of the nodes, it
will remain fixed while other selected nodes scale or rotate around it as a center.
For example, you can select all nodes of an object by pressing Ctrl-A and then
hover on a node and rotate the entire object around that node with [ and ].</p>
			<a id="section12.6"/><h2>12.6 Path Tweaking</h2>
			<p>
				You've already seen in <a href="c08.xhtml#section8.9">8.9</a> how the Tweak
tool (W, Shift-F2) can be used to paint and
jitter colors in objects, and in <a href="c06.xhtml#section6.10">6.10</a>, how it can be used to move
and transform objects.
This versatile tool’s remaining modes—<em>Push</em>, <em>Shrink/Grow</em>, <em>Attract/Repel</em>, and <em>Roughen</em>—are
for editing paths.</p>

				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>The Tweak tool's approach to editing paths is fundamentally different from that of the
Node tool. The Node tool, true to its name, enables you to edit nodes, and you need
to have a working knowledge of how nodes define the shape of the path. With the Tweak
tool, you can forget everything you ever knew about nodes; just interact with your
path as a pliable body, like a lump of modeling clay, bending and sculpting it at any
point in any direction. While hardly useful for technical drawing, tweaking paths is
perfect for creating artistic images such as cartoons.</p>
			<p>The Tweak tool works on any number of selected objects. For example, you can select
all (Ctrl-A) and "smear" your entire drawing in Push mode. The tool will even
go into groups and act on individual paths inside groups. If you're trying to use it without selecting something, it will remind you to
select some objects first with a status bar message.</p>

			<h3>
				12.6.1 <a id="247"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_247" title="247"/>Width and Force</h3>
			<p>
				In any of the Tweak tool's modes, what you work with is a circular<em>brush</em> (the orange-edged circle centered on the cursor) with which you "paint" over
selected objects to change them.
The <span class="ui">Width</span> parameter controls the brush size, and the amount of action it applies depends on the<span class="ui">Force</span> parameter as well as on pen pressure if you have a pressure-sensitive
tablet. See <a href="c06.xhtml#section6.10">6.10</a> for more details on those parameters.</p>
			<p>It takes practice to apply just the right amount of drag at the right place, with
the proper force (including pen pressure), and with the correct brush size to get the result you
want. However, this skill is very rewarding—what used to be awkward and time-consuming
with the Node tool is often much quicker and more natural with the Tweak tool.</p>
			<a id="section12.6.2"/><h3>12.6.2 Fidelity</h3>
			<p>
				Any tweaking of a path slightly distorts—or rather <em>simplifies</em>, just
like the <span class="ui">Simplify</span> command—the entire path, including even those parts you
didn't touch with the brush.</p>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Fidelity</span> value allows you to control the amount of this parasitic 
simplification. The tradeoff here is the number of nodes in the resulting path. With low
fidelity, the resulting path will be node-poor but probably distorted more than you
would find acceptable. High fidelity minimizes distortions, but the path may end
up having a lot of nodes—which inflates the SVG size and slows down Inkscape.</p>
			<p>The best value for fidelity depends on the nature of your
artwork. If you're sculpting amorphous blobs, you can get away with a
low fidelity of about 20. If, however, you are pushing or growing a
text string converted to path and want the letters outside the
distorted area to remain as clean and legible as possible, you will
need to raise the fidelity to 80 or more.</p>
			<p>
				Under the hood, the Tweak tool recasts the path into an
"approximating polygon" with thousands of tiny straight line sides,
tweaks the vertices of that polygon, and then recasts it back into
a path with Bézier segments. The fidelity level controls
the precision of this transformation and thus the number of
nodes in the result, but no fidelity setting will give you the exact
nodes of the original—some of the nodes will always end up displaced and changed, just like
they do after a <span class="ui">Simplify</span>.</p>
			<a id="section12.6.3"/><h3>12.6.3 Push Mode</h3>
			<p>Push is the Tweak tool's default mode. To switch to Push mode from any other mode,
press Shift-P, or click its button on the controls bar.</p>
			<p><a id="248"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_248" title="248"/>Push is a general-purpose sculpting mode. When you drag in this mode, the parts of the
selected paths covered by the brush are shifted in the direction of your drag, for as
long as the mouse button or pen is held down, as shown in <a href="#fig12-34">Figure 12-34</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig12-34"/><figure>

				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-34: The Tweak tool's Push mode</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Varying brush width as necessary, you can transmogrify by pushing any path into almost any other—but 
you can also use it for small tweaks, such as flattening a bump, bending an appendage, or
curving an engraving grid.  Thanks to the brush's bell-like profile, the paths
you're pushing respond by curving softly and smoothly, as <a href="#fig12-35">Figure 12-35</a> demonstrates.</p>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<a id="section12.6.4"/>
			<h3>12.6.4 Shrink/Grow Mode</h3>
			<p>The Shrink/Grow mode (Shift-S) moves 
each point of a path in a direction perpendicular to the path's
edge in that point, either inward (shrink, plain drag) or outward (grow, drag 
with Shift). To quickly access this 
mode from any other mode of the tool, 
Ctrl-drag to shrink and Shift-Ctrl-drag to grow.</p>
			<p><a id="249"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_249" title="249"/>The Shrink/Grow mode is very similar to 
the <span class="ui">Inset</span> and <span class="ui">Outset</span> commands (<a href="#section12.4">12.4</a>), except
that the Tweak tool, as always, acts softly on a part of a path instead of the
whole path. You can use this mode to lighten or darken parts of
drawings with of many details—such as engravings, freehand scribbles, or even text
(converted to paths), as shown in <a href="#fig12-36">Figure 12-36</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig12-36"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-tweak-growshrink.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-36: The Shrink/Grow 
mode of the Tweak tool</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The Shrink/Grow mode allows you to easily  Shift-drag to chase the moving edge of the path:
this way, using a small-sized brush, you can grow appendages and branches of any length
out of a path. (You can also do this in Push mode, but Grow is somewhat
easier for this task.)  Also, Shrink mode can act as a quick eraser—cutting
through paths, evaporating small crumbs and bits, and trimming long brush strokes is 
easy and natural, as <a href="#fig12-37">Figure 12-37</a> demonstrates.</p>
			<a id="fig12-37"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-tweak-growshrink2.svg.png"/>

					<p>Figure 12-37: Using Shrink mode as an eraser</p>

			</figure>
			<a id="section12.6.5"/>
			<h3>12.6.5 Attract/Repel Mode</h3>
			<p>
				The Attract/Repel mode (Shift-A) works
by moving each affected point on a path toward (attract, plain drag) or from (repel, drag
with Shift) the cursor
point, pinching and exploding whatever paths fall under the brush. Sometimes, this
may look similar to Shrink/Grow, but the difference is that Attract/Repel doesn't care
about the direction of the path being tweaked; this mode moves everything symmetrically
around the center of the brush (<a href="#fig12-38">Figure 12-38</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig12-38"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-tweak-attractrepel.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-38: The Tweak tool's Attract/Repel
mode</p>

			<a id="section12.6.6"/>
			<h3>
				12.6.6 <a id="250"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_250" title="250"/>Roughen Mode</h3>
			<p>
				The Roughen mode (Shift-R) randomly distorts the edge of the path
where you apply your brush, without changing the path's overall shape, as shown in <a href="#fig12-39">Figure 12-39</a>. Slight
roughening simply makes the edge crooked and uneven, while strong roughening tears and
explodes the edge into random blobs and splotches.</p>
			<a id="fig12-39"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="13/pa-tweak-roughen.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 12-39: The Tweak tool's Roughen mode</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				This operation, especially with high fidelity, adds <em>a lot</em> of
nodes.  Such a roughened path may become hard to edit—it's awkward to
handle with the Node tool and may be painfully slow with the Tweak tool. I recommend 
finalizing the overall shape of a path using pushing, growing, and shrinking as needed—and roughen it, if necessary, only as the final step.</p>

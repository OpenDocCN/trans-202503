<h2 id="h1-502321c07-0001">Introduction</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Water is a fundamental human need, but its cleanliness is just as important. Even before the advent of modern municipal engineering, many civilizations had developed strategies for delivering fresh water to urban areas and removing wastewater to prevent it from contaminating water sources. In the 19th century, as cities worldwide began to grow in population and density, the threat to public health from waterborne diseases became more menacing and insidious. The science of sanitation developed as a necessity to keep city-dwellers safe from plague and pestilence. Now nearly all cities and towns have complex systems for delivering abundant and clean water to their citizens and disposing of sewage. Although easy to take for granted, the development and maintenance of municipal water and wastewater systems are massive undertakings, requiring a lot of infrastructure. Much of the pipes and valves in cities are buried below the ground, but you can observe many facilities and equipment if you know where to look. </p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c07-0002"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_163" title="163"/>Intakes and Pumping Stations</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Much of the water we rely on for drinking, cleaning, and irrigation of crops starts its journey in a river, stream, creek, lake, or reservoir. These sources are collectively known as <em>surface waters</em> (as opposed to groundwater resources, which are discussed in the next section). Collecting water from a river or lake might seem straightforward; however, many engineering challenges are associated with transitioning the flow from a surface water source into a pipeline or <em>aqueduct</em> to be delivered to its destination. <em>Intake structures</em> perform this critical task. They can be associated with an impoundment or diversion (for example, at a dam), but intakes are often standalone structures, and you’ll see them near riverbanks, lakes, or reservoirs if you keep an eye out.</p>
<p>Lake or <span class="SmallCaps">reservoir intakes</span> often consist of large concrete or masonry towers (as discussed in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 6">Chapter 6</span>). Complicating matters, a structure considered an <em>outlet</em> at a dam might also serve as an <em>intake</em> for a pumping station or aqueduct. Older structures called <span class="SmallCaps">crib intakes </span>were<span class="SmallCaps"> </span>constructed onshore, floated into place, and then filled with rubble. A central shaft carries water by gravity through the intake to a tunnel below the lake where it can be pumped to treatment and distribution facilities on the shore.</p>
<p>Although complete removal of contaminants and sediment is usually performed later, the engineering of intakes includes making sure that the source water entering a pipe is as clean as possible to reduce the burden on downstream water treatment plants. This untreated water is often known as <em>raw water</em>. In reservoirs and lakes, the volume of suspended sediments, the quantity of microorganisms like plankton and algae, and even the temperature of the water can vary significantly with depth. Thus, most intake structures on lakes and reservoirs have openings (or <em>ports</em>) at multiple levels so that operators can select the ideal mixture of water from the depths within the lake or reservoir. Gates on the various openings can be opened or closed depending on the conditions within the source water and the needs downstream.</p>
<p>Intakes on rivers contend with a different set of challenges. First, the level in a river can vary significantly. In addition, river intakes must contend with the fact that streams are dynamic systems. Floods can move massive quantities of sediment, changing the location and shape of banks and even altering the course of a river altogether. River intakes are almost always located either on a straight section of the channel or on the outside of a bend. Sediment tends to deposit on the inside of curves where flows are slower, so engineers avoid those locations where an intake could be clogged more readily. <span class="SmallCaps">Bank intakes</span> are installed on a riverbank to allow water to flow laterally into the structure. However, the deepest part of a natural channel (called the <em>thalweg</em>) is often in the center, so bank intakes often <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_164" title="164"/>require dredging of the riverbed to allow water to flow when the river level is low. This dredging is not only disruptive to the sensitive environment of a river, but it must be performed regularly as sediments in the river deposit over time.</p>
<p>One solution to the challenges of varying water levels and sediment buildup is constructing a small <em>weir</em> downstream. Such a structure raises the water level in the river while also slowing down the flow so that sediment can settle out. However, weirs create an impediment to navigation and migratory wildlife, and they can be quite dangerous (as discussed in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 6">Chapter 6</span>), so their use has fallen out of favor. Modern intake structures on rivers make use of careful siting to avoid problems with sedimentation and lower water levels while minimizing environmental impacts. One alternative to bank intakes involves running a <span class="SmallCaps">conduit</span> from a deeper section of the channel to the shore, often performed using tunneling to avoid the need for trenching in the natural riverbank. A <span class="SmallCaps">screen</span> on the end of the conduit prevents fish or debris from entering the line, and a <span class="SmallCaps">gate</span> controls the flow.</p>
<p>Unless the final destination of the raw water is well below the source, most intakes will be accompanied by a <em>pumping station</em>, which lifts the water from its source into a pipeline or aqueduct. <span class="SmallCaps">Pumps</span> are often installed directly above or adjacent to the intake structure, sometimes within a building called a <span class="SmallCaps">pump house</span>. These structures may be recognizable by built-in <span class="SmallCaps">gantry cranes</span> that allow equipment to be serviced or replaced when needed.</p>
<p>At a pumping station, water flows into ports, through a conduit or tunnel, then into a structure called a <em>sump</em> (or <span class="SmallCaps">wet well</span>), which creates enough volume and depth for pumps to operate. Sumps must be designed to create ideal flow conditions to avoid inefficiencies and damage to the pump. Turbulent and swirling flow in a sump can lead to a <em>vortex,</em> just like what happens when you drain a bathtub. If a vortex is allowed to enter the mouth of the <span class="SmallCaps">pump column</span>, the air will reduce its efficiency and may even cause it to fail. <span class="SmallCaps">Vortex breakers</span> are sometimes installed within sumps to keep the flow from swirling as it is drawn into the pump. </p>
<p>Intakes can represent a severe hazard to swimmers and boaters in rivers and lakes because of the submerged structures and fast-flowing water. Where public safety may be at risk, owners of intakes often install floating <span class="SmallCaps">booms</span> to warn people of the potential danger. These booms consist of brightly colored floating elements linked together with chains. They are anchored to the river or lakebed to create an exclusion zone around a dangerous structure. Some booms are even designed to be strong enough to hold back debris, floating trees, and ice that could damage intake structures. In addition, when an intake or pumping station must be located near the bank, <span class="SmallCaps">armoring</span> (such as <em>rock riprap</em>) is usually installed to protect against erosion that could threaten the structure.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Because intake structures are often installed in natural rivers and lakes, they must contend with aquatic wildlife. Certain types of organisms—including mussels, snails, and clams—can cling to water infrastructure, clogging intakes and reducing the efficiency of pipelines as they accumulate (a process known as <em>biofouling</em>). Utilities often employ anti-fouling coatings that discourage animals from attaching or make them easier to remove. However, those coatings must be reapplied regularly, requiring costly shutdowns. In many cases, the most effective solution to biofouling is mechanical cleaning (in other words, scraping the organisms off). Diving teams can clean accessible structures like screens, but pipelines are often cleaned with a cylindrical device, called a <em>pig</em>, drawn through the conduit. Many of the most troublesome species are not native to the affected water bodies and thus have less competition to survive, allowing their populations to expand rapidly. One of the most important ways to combat biofouling is to prevent these invasive species from spreading to new water bodies in the first place, so many states have laws requiring boats to be cleaned, drained, and dried before entering a river or lake.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c07-0003"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_167" title="167"/>Wells</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Not all water that falls as precipitation runs off into lakes and rivers. Some seeps down into the ground through the spaces between soil and rock particles. Sometimes this groundwater reaches a less permeable geologic layer (called an <span class="SmallCaps">aquitard</span>) and cannot continue downward. Over long periods of time, infiltrating water can accumulate into vast underground resources called <span class="SmallCaps">aquifers</span>. A common misconception is that groundwater is stored in open areas like underground rivers or lakes. Although they exist in some locations, large underground caverns are relatively rare. Nearly all groundwater aquifers are geologic formations of sand, gravel, or rock that are saturated with water, just like a sponge. Extracting this groundwater for use by humans is the job of a <em>well</em>. At their simplest, wells are just holes into which groundwater can seep from the surrounding soil. However, modern wells utilize sophisticated engineering to provide a reliable and long-lasting source of fresh water. Farms use them for irrigation. Rural homes and businesses often rely on them when a connection to a municipal distribution system is unavailable. And many large cities utilize groundwater as a primary source of fresh water for their populations.</p>
<p>The availability of groundwater varies significantly around the world. Nearly all places have layers of saturated soil or rock below the ground. Still, the volume of water, its quality, and the ease of extracting it to the surface depend primarily on the local geology. Groundwater is also connected to the rest of the hydrologic system, so groundwater withdrawals may impact the volume and quality of surface water resources. Unfortunately, we can’t see below the ground, and methods for exploring subsurface geology mainly involve drilling <em>boreholes</em>, which can be quite expensive. Thus, the availability of groundwater in a specific area is usually determined by combining many sources of information, including local knowledge and the performance of nearby wells. Selecting the location and depth of a well is sometimes an art as much as it is a science for groundwater hydrologists. </p>
<p>A well is usually installed by boring into the subsurface with a drill rig. The driller takes detailed records of the excavated soil and rock (called <em>cuttings</em>) that can be compared to assumptions about the geology that were made during the well design. Once a borehole is excavated to the proper depth, the well can be installed. Steel or plastic pipe, called <span class="SmallCaps">casing</span>, is placed into the hole to provide support so that loose soil and rock can’t fall into the well. A <span class="SmallCaps">screen</span> is attached to the casing at the depths where water will be withdrawn. The screen allows groundwater to flow into the casing while keeping larger soil and rock particles out of the well where they could contaminate the water or cause additional wear on pumps.</p>
<p>Once the casing and screen are installed, the <em>annular space</em> (the area <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_168" title="168"/>between the excavated borehole and casing) must be filled. Where the well is screened, this space is usually filled with gravel or coarse sand called <span class="SmallCaps">gravel pack</span>. This material acts as a filter to keep fine particles of the <span class="SmallCaps">aquifer formation</span> from entering the well through the screen. The space along unscreened casing is usually filled with <span class="SmallCaps">bentonite clay</span>, which swells to create an impermeable seal so that shallower groundwater (which may be lower quality) can’t travel along the annular space into the screens. Finally, the uppermost section of the annular space is permanently sealed, again using bentonite clay or sometimes using <span class="SmallCaps">cement grout</span>. This seal ensures that contaminants on the surface cannot find their way into the well. In a worst-case scenario, pollutants could enter a well and flow into the aquifer, contaminating it for other users, so most jurisdictions have strict rules for sealing wells at the surface. The casing is usually extended aboveground to create a <span class="SmallCaps">wellhead</span> with a <span class="SmallCaps">concrete pad</span> extending in all directions to prevent damage or infiltration to the well.</p>
<p>The process of drilling a well can smear a layer of clay or fine particles along the surface of the borehole, creating an obstruction to flow. After a well is installed, it is usually taken through a procedure called <em>well development</em> to establish a hydraulic connection with the aquifer. Development involves surging water or air into and out of the well to remove fine sediments along the contact between the gravel pack and aquifer formation.</p>
<p>A properly completed and developed well allows groundwater to flow easily and sediment-free from the aquifer into the casing. However, it still needs a way to deliver that water up to the surface. Shallow wells can use <em>jet pumps</em> that draw water up using suction like a straw. However, this method doesn’t work for deeper wells. When you drink through a straw, you create a vacuum, allowing the pressure of the surrounding atmosphere to push your beverage upward. However, only so much atmosphere is available to balance the weight of a fluid in a suction pipe. If you could create a complete vacuum in a straw, the highest you could draw a drink of water is around 10 meters or 33 feet. Thus, deeper wells cannot use suction to bring water to the surface. Instead, the pump must be installed at the bottom of the well so that it can push water to the top.</p>
<p>High-capacity wells are usually equipped with <em>vertical turbine pumps</em>. An <span class="SmallCaps">electric motor</span> is mounted to the wellhead and connected to a vertical <span class="SmallCaps">shaft</span> running down through the center of a <span class="SmallCaps">column pipe</span>. At the bottom, the shaft drives a series of <span class="SmallCaps">impellers</span> that force water from the well up through the column pipe into the <span class="SmallCaps">discharge line</span>. Vertical turbine pumps are easy to service since the motor is accessible at the surface. However, they are noisy and require precise alignment of the well for its entire length. The popular alternative involves placing the motor at the bottom of the well with the impellers in a sealed assembly called a <em>submersible pump</em>. Submersible pumps are quieter <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_169" title="169"/>because the moving components are deep below the ground, but they usually have a lower capacity since they use smaller motors to fit within the casing of a well.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">If a pipe breaks or freezes, it may allow contaminated water to travel from the surface into a well, polluting the water within (and potentially even the surrounding aquifer). This is true not only for wells but also for water distribution systems. If a potable water supply loses pressure due to a main break or loss of power to pumps, hazardous pollutants can be drawn into the system. Backflow prevention devices are installed at wells and other locations in a water supply network where contaminants are present, such as irrigation systems and fire sprinklers. Many devices use two <em>check valves</em> in series to ensure water can only flow in one direction, even if one valve malfunctions. They are often combined with shutoff valves and ports to allow for regular testing of the mechanical components.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c07-0004"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_171" title="171"/>Transmission Pipelines and Aqueducts</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Ideally, water resources are located near the place they’re needed. Unfortunately, many populated areas don’t receive ample precipitation throughout the year. As a result, some of the most impressive infrastructure projects in the world have the simple job of delivering <em>raw water</em> from a source to a populated region where it can be distributed to users. The ancient Romans were famous for their aqueducts, which traversed many miles to carry fresh water into cities, even crossing rivers using elaborate stone bridges. However, the <span class="SmallCaps">bridges</span> were only a tiny part of each aqueduct system that often included miles of pipes, canals, and tunnels. Modern engineers use many of the same tools as the ancient Romans to move water to where it’s needed.</p>
<p>Terminology can vary, but the word <em>aqueduct</em> generally describes any human-made structure meant to deliver water across a long distance. Perhaps the most straightforward technique for moving water is within an <span class="SmallCaps">open canal</span>. If the source is high enough in elevation above its destination, excavating a channel is a guaranteed way to compel water to flow since gravity does all the work. Many aqueducts have very gradual <span class="SmallCaps">slopes</span> such that the incline is practically imperceptible to the eye. However, the amount of fluid that can flow by gravity is related to the channel’s size and slope, so a steeper canal can be smaller (and thus cheaper to build) while moving the same volume of water as a larger, more gradual channel.</p>
<p>The flow volume isn’t the only design consideration for an open channel, though. The flow velocity must be fast enough to minimize settling of silt on the canal floor but slow enough to avoid scouring and erosion. The channel also must be wide enough to carry sufficient flow without being so shallow as to accelerate the <span class="SmallCaps">evaporation</span> of water into the air or <span class="SmallCaps">seepage</span> into the soil below. Engineers balance these factors when selecting the route a canal will take and the shape of the channel along the way. For example, many aqueducts run parallel to rivers where the topography naturally descends over long distances, and most canals use a trapezoidal cross section with <span class="SmallCaps">sloped sides</span> that are less likely to collapse. In addition, many canals include a concrete lining to mitigate seepage losses and scour.</p>
<p>Open canals are usually less expensive than other options, but they are subject to several disadvantages, including water loss through evaporation and seepage, freezing conditions that can block the flow, and their vulnerability to pollution. Canals also have environmental impacts because they divide the landscape just like a road or highway. Finally, channels can flow only downhill, limiting their practicality in hilly terrain. In many cases, moving an aqueduct underground in a <span class="SmallCaps">tunnel</span> or pipeline makes sense. </p>
<p>When not pressurized, an <span class="SmallCaps">underground aqueduct</span> works exactly like a canal on the surface, flowing by gravity <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_172" title="172"/>with a free surface at the top. The water is protected from pollution, evaporation, and seepage from the <span class="SmallCaps">tunnel lining</span> or pipe. Underground aqueducts must have a consistent <span class="SmallCaps">slope</span> for gravity flow, but that is easier to accomplish when the watercourse isn’t constrained to the Earth’s surface. Underground tunnels also reduce environmental issues by minimizing impacts at the surface. They can even travel under rivers using vertical <span class="SmallCaps">shafts,</span> which help form <span class="SmallCaps">inverted siphons</span>, eliminating the need for bridges.</p>
<p>When the source water is lower in elevation than its destination or the terrain along the way undulates too much for gravity flow, a <span class="SmallCaps">pressurized pipeline</span> may be the only feasible way for an aqueduct to function. A pumping station at the intake (as discussed in the previous section) forces water into the pipeline, allowing it to flow against gravity. These pipes are often installed in <span class="SmallCaps">trenches</span> just far enough below the surface to protect against damage and freezing. The pipe is set atop a layer of <span class="SmallCaps">bedding</span> that acts like a mattress to distribute loads along the line.</p>
<p>The selection of the pipe material is a critical part of a pipeline design. The pipe must be strong enough to withstand both the internal water pressure and external forces from the <span class="SmallCaps">backfill</span> and surface loads. Pipes must also resist corrosion from the water they carry inside and the soil along the outside. A pipe can be made from various materials, including steel, plastic, fiberglass, and concrete, and all materials have advantages depending on the situation. Larger pipelines often use protective outer <span class="SmallCaps">coatings</span> and inner <span class="SmallCaps">linings</span> to extend the lifespan of the line.</p>
<p>Unlike plumbing pipe that uses glue or threaded connections, most large diameter pipelines are either welded at each joint or use a bell and spigot design. When the <span class="SmallCaps">spigot</span> of one pipe section slides into the <span class="SmallCaps">bell</span> of another, it compresses a rubber <span class="SmallCaps">gasket</span>, creating a watertight seal. A band of <span class="SmallCaps">grout</span> is sometimes installed around each joint to protect the gasket and any exposed steel from damage and corrosion.</p>
<p>Selecting the pipe size is another critical decision in the design of a pipeline. Smaller pipes are less expensive, but they require water to move faster to achieve the equivalent flow of a larger pipe. Water loses energy through friction, and these losses increase with velocity, so the money saved by installing a smaller pipe might be lost over time from the increased cost of pumping. For long pipelines, these frictional losses might be so significant to require <span class="SmallCaps">booster pumps</span> along the way that maintain pressure in the system. As pipes age, their inner surfaces get rougher, so engineers must consider the friction and pumping costs through the entire lifetime of the pipeline.</p>
<p>The mass of fluid in a long pipeline can be enormous, sometimes greater than a fully loaded freight train. When all that water is moving through a pipe, it has quite a bit of momentum. However, even though it’s a fluid, water isn’t very compressible, so closing a valve or stopping a pump gives that momentum nowhere to go. Instead, it creates a spike in pressure that travels as a shockwave through the pipe, an effect <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_173" title="173"/>called <em>water hammer</em>. These shockwaves can be a problem in residential homes when taps close too quickly, resulting in lines knocking in the walls. However, in large pipelines that can contain immense volumes of fluid, closing a valve quickly can be the equivalent of slamming a freight train into a concrete wall. To avoid spikes in pressure that could damage equipment or rupture pipes, engineers specify slow-closing valves and pumps that start and stop gradually. In situations where operators need rapid control over the flow, <span class="SmallCaps">surge tanks</span> can be installed to absorb the extreme pressure spikes and minimize the damaging effects of water hammer.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Although pipelines are meant to convey water, engineers also must consider what happens if air gets into the lines. Pipes are sealed systems, but air can still enter by being dissolved into water, introduced by pumps, or from the initial filling of the pipe. When these air bubbles coalesce in a high spot, they take up space and create a constriction to flow. In the worst-case scenario, air pockets can completely block a pipeline (an effect called <em>air lock</em>). Many pipelines are equipped with <em>air release valves</em> that can automatically vent bubbles from high spots in the pipe while keeping the water inside. You might see them protruding above the ground surface if you look carefully.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c07-0005"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_175" title="175"/>Water Treatment Plants</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Most sources of <span class="SmallCaps">raw water</span> are subject to contamination by bacteria, sediments, and other substances that can be dangerous to human health. In addition, organic particles can negatively affect the water’s taste and smell. Before water can be distributed to homes and businesses where it may be used for drinking or cooking, it usually must first go through a purification process at a water treatment plant to be made <em>potable</em>. A wide variety of techniques are used to purify water and ensure that it’s safe for human consumption. Most water treatment plants are custom-designed for a specific water source and the potential contaminants that threaten it. For example, groundwater often requires less treatment than surface water sources because it is less vulnerable to pollution. Not every treatment plant uses the same set of processes, and not all parts of a water treatment plant are visible to an outside observer. However, understanding the basic steps of purifying water at a municipal scale provides insight and context into every other element of a city’s water distribution system.</p>
<p>Groundwater and surface water both contain suspended particles of various materials. These solid particles give the water a murky appearance (called <em>turbidity</em>) and can harbor dangerous microorganisms. The first step in most treatment plants is to remove these suspended particles from the water in a process called <em>sedimentation,</em> which is often accomplished in a series of three stages. First, a chemical <em>coagulant</em> is vigorously mixed into the water. Coagulants neutralize the electric charges that cause suspended particles to repel each other, allowing them to stick together. Next, a chemical <em>flocculant</em> is added to the water, which bonds suspended particles together into groups called <span class="SmallCaps">flocs</span>. Flocculant is added to the raw water slowly to avoid breaking up the flocs.</p>
<p>As the flocs of suspended particles grow, they eventually become heavy enough to settle out (the third and final step of sedimentation). Raw water is pumped to a basin where it can sit nearly motionless while the flocs fall to the bottom. This basin can be as simple as a rectangular concrete box that’s regularly drained and cleaned, but many water treatment plants use tanks called <span class="SmallCaps">clarifiers</span> that include mechanisms to collect the solids as they settle at the bottom automatically. These circular basins are a recognizable component of many water treatment plants. The raw water flows up through the center of the clarifier and slowly makes its way toward the outer perimeter, dropping particles that form a layer of <span class="SmallCaps">sludge</span> at the bottom. The clarified water passes over a <span class="SmallCaps">weir</span> so that only a thin layer farthest from the sludge can exit the basin. A <span class="SmallCaps">scraper</span> pushes the sludge down the sloped bottom of the clarifier into a <span class="SmallCaps">hopper</span> where it can be collected for disposal.</p>
<p>Sedimentation removes most suspended solids, but it can’t completely <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_176" title="176"/>clean the water of tiny particles, viruses, and bacteria. Most water treatment plants follow sedimentation with a process of <em>filtration</em>, which involves forcing water to pass through porous media. The filters in municipal treatment plants commonly consist of layers of <span class="SmallCaps">sand</span>, <span class="SmallCaps">coal</span>, or other granular materials. The water flows by gravity or under pressure from pumps through the filter media while undesirable particles within the water are left behind. A layer of <span class="SmallCaps">gravel</span> prevents any of the media from washing out with the filtered water. Over time, solids accumulate within the filter media, reducing its efficiency. Filters are <em>backwashed</em> by sending water through the opposite direction to clean the media. The backwash water is sent back to the treatment plant inlet to be reprocessed.</p>
<p>Some modern treatment plants have abandoned traditional sand filters for <em>membranes,</em> which consist of thin sheets of semipermeable material. Pressurized water is forced through the tiny pores in the membrane, leaving any unwanted particles behind. Water treatment plants using membrane filtration usually have a rack of tubular <span class="SmallCaps">filter modules</span>, allowing quick replacement of individual units if they clog or malfunction. Membrane filters can remove even the tiniest contaminants (including even viruses), so they are sometimes preferred over using multiple separate treatment processes to create potable water.</p>
<p>The final step of a typical water treatment plant is <span class="SmallCaps">disinfection</span>, where any remaining parasites, bacteria, and viruses are killed. There are several methods for deactivating microorganisms to make water potable, but the primary tool used in most cities involves adding a disinfectant chemical to the water (usually either chlorine or chloramine). These chemicals are safe for human consumption at low concentrations while still killing microorganisms that can make us sick. Many treatment plants use chlorine gas stored in metal tanks called <span class="SmallCaps">cylinders</span>. An <span class="SmallCaps">injection system</span> carefully feeds the gas at a predetermined rate where it dissolves into the water and kills disease-causing pathogens.</p>
<p>An essential benefit of chemical disinfection is that it continues to work as water travels through miles of pipes from the treatment plant to individual customers within the distribution system. But before potable water leaves the treatment plant, it must first be tested to make sure it meets government standards for quality. Many different potential contaminants can be hazardous to human health, and source water chemistry can change over time (especially between seasons), so treatment plants must constantly verify that water at the outlet is clean and safe.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Chemical disinfectants, like chlorine, are usually added to water at the treatment plant. However, water quality standards require that some disinfectant remains in the water to the farthest reaches of the distribution system. This ensures that dangerous organisms cannot survive at any point along the way. The chlorine that stays in the water is called the <em>residual</em>, and it is a critical indicator that a water treatment and distribution process is operating effectively. Chlorine decays over time as it travels through pipes and tanks, but introducing disinfectant at a treatment plant offers only a single opportunity to provide enough residual at all points in a distribution system. Often, the pipes near the plant have too much chlorine and remote parts of the system have too little.</p>
<p>Many cities use booster chlorination stations in strategic locations to provide a more uniform distribution of disinfectant. Some can even automatically analyze the chlorine residual and adjust the booster dose accordingly. These booster stations may be located in small separate buildings or adjacent to other parts of a water distribution system (such as water towers or tanks). A warning sign about chlorine may be the only hint of what’s inside.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Once water has been collected from a source, transported to a population center, and purified from contaminants, it must be delivered to the customers within a utility’s service area. Potable water is transported from wells or treatment plants, sometimes across many miles, to each home and business. A municipal <em>water distribution system</em> consists of all the interconnected pipes, valves, and other elements that combine to carry clean water used for drinking, cleaning, cooking, watering plants, and a wide variety of commercial and industrial processes. The distribution system also provides a secondary benefit as a pressurized water supply for fighting fires to minimize their chance of spreading to adjacent structures. Unlike raw water infrastructure consisting of large, singular facilities, a water distribution system is necessarily spread out across an urban area. Many challenges are associated with constructing and maintaining such a sprawling system so critical to human health.</p>
<p>The first step in a water distribution system is usually the <span class="SmallCaps">pumps</span>. Like those located at the raw water intakes described previously, pumps do the job of pressurizing pipes within the system, usually to between two and six times normal atmospheric pressure, which is why they are often called <em>high-service pumps</em>. (Some of this pressure gets stored in tanks or <span class="SmallCaps">water towers</span>, as discussed in the next section.) Pumping stations are usually located within a <span class="SmallCaps">water treatment plant</span> to send fresh water on its way. The pressure that pumps provide not only induces the potable water to flow to its destination but also ensures that contaminants can’t enter the distribution system through open joints or small holes in the pipes. If leaks develop, water will flow out of the pressurized system rather than allow impurities or pollutants to enter. High-service pumps used in water distribution systems consume significant amounts of electricity, so they often require robust connections to the electrical grid and backup generators for potential outages. Energy is often one of the highest ongoing costs for a water utility. Conserving water reduces waste of the water itself and reduces the significant amount of energy required to collect, clean, and deliver it.</p>
<p>From the pumps, clean water enters a series of pipes called <span class="SmallCaps">water mains</span>, the circulatory system for potable water within a city. Water mains are usually installed belowground to protect them from damage and, more important, from freezing. Most mains are connected in a grid or loop pattern, often following the paths of city streets. Many jurisdictions require that water mains be horizontally separated from underground <span class="SmallCaps">sewers</span>, so when these lines run parallel, they are often located on opposite sides of a street.</p>
<p>Installing water mains in a <em>gridded</em> fashion requires additional pipes and joints. However, in a gridded system, water can take multiple paths to any given location, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_180" title="180"/>increasing the reliability of service and allowing water mains to be repaired without affecting the rest of the network. Gridded water mains also help avoid stagnation. When pipes have <span class="SmallCaps">dead-ends</span>, water flows only when users along each particular line turn on the tap. If clean water sits in a pipe for an extended duration, the disinfectant can decay, deteriorating the water quality. In gridded systems, the water in the pipes continuously circulates to meet demands wherever they occur.</p>
<p>Individual customers get their water from the main lines through <span class="SmallCaps">service connections</span>. A <span class="SmallCaps">saddle</span> is used to create a tap point to the main line. Piping usually runs from the saddle to a <span class="SmallCaps">water meter</span> that measures the volume of water used, allowing the utility to charge each customer based on usage. Metering each service connection encourages water conservation and helps utilities identify leaks in the distribution system.</p>
<p>Water mains do break on occasion, usually due to shifting ground, freezing, or simple deterioration due to age. When this happens, the pipe must be excavated and repaired. Although repairing a line while it’s discharging a geyser of water is possible, it’s usually a difficult ordeal. Isolating the main from the rest of the system before starting repairs is much easier. <span class="SmallCaps">Shutoff valves</span> are typically located at intersections in water mains to allow parts of the network to be disconnected so crews can fix a broken pipe. Valves are installed in belowground enclosures with small steel lids. Most pipe intersections have one line without a valve to save installation and maintenance costs. If the unvalved pipe must be isolated, all the other valves at the intersection are shut. Crews use a <span class="SmallCaps">valve key</span> to open or close each valve, as needed. Similarly, one or more shutoff valves are also included at each service connection so that individual homes or businesses can be isolated for plumbing repairs or during an emergency.</p>
<p>Although clean water is essential for basic human needs, cities also need water readily available for fighting fires. Some of the worst disasters in history occurred when fire raced through a populated area with insufficient means to prevent the spread. Cities are dotted with <span class="SmallCaps">fire hydrants</span> that provide connection points to pressurized water mains to help extinguish fires. Most places in the United States use dry-barrel hydrants, which have their <span class="SmallCaps">valves</span> located belowground, protecting them from damage due to errant vehicles and reducing the chance of water freezing within the exposed hydrant. In some places, the color of the hydrant <span class="SmallCaps">nozzle caps</span> indicates the maximum flow rate available for firefighting. In colder areas, hydrants may include <span class="SmallCaps">markers</span> that extend above the snowfall to make them easier to locate in the winter.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Until the early 20th century, it was common to use pipes made from lead to connect houses and businesses to underground water mains, and some cities continued to allow lead service lines into the 1980s. Lead is a durable metal while still being flexible enough to make pipes easy to bend. However, even at low concentrations, exposure to lead is dangerous to human health and can cause neurological effects, especially in children. Lead can leach into water traveling through pipes, exposing humans to this hazardous contaminant. Most cities with large numbers of lead service lines are working to replace them permanently, often at a high cost. In addition, some cities introduce corrosion-inhibiting chemicals in the water to reduce the chance of leaching lead from the pipes before they can be replaced. If you’re unsure if there is lead in your water, consider having it tested by a laboratory to reduce your chance of exposure to this dangerous heavy metal.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c07-0007"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_183" title="183"/>Water Towers and Tanks</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The demand for clean water varies significantly not only over the course of a year (due to seasonal changes in weather) but even over a single day. Water use in a city is usually highest in the mornings and evenings when people are taking showers, cooking, and watering lawns. In addition, some of the highest water demands in cities are created by fires, which occur randomly, day or night. Fires can burn out of control in dense urban areas, so most municipalities ensure their distribution systems have reserve capacity even on the days with the highest water demands. Engineers who design distribution systems must consider all the possible variability in flows when selecting the sizes for pumps, pipes, valves, and other equipment. One of the most important parts of a water distribution system (and often the most visible) is a solution to all this variability in potable water demand: storage.</p>
<p>Many steps involved in collecting, moving, purifying, and distributing water are most efficient when they happen at a steady rate. At treatment plants, chemical feeds and purification processes can’t tolerate sudden changes. In addition, <span class="SmallCaps">pumps</span> used in water distribution systems often run at a single speed. Without somewhere to store water, operators would constantly need to ramp production up or down to meet changing demands. In addition, all the treatment facilities and pumps would need to be sized for peak water needs, even if they were used to their total capacity only once or twice per year, increasing their cost and complexity. Tanks and reservoirs smooth out the peaks and valleys of water demand, allowing pumps and other infrastructure to be operated for average conditions. When usage is low (for example, at night), the treatment plant overproduces to fill the tanks. When use is high, the stored water can supplement the treatment plant to meet water demands.</p>
<p>Many types of storage structures are used in water distribution systems. <span class="SmallCaps">Ground-level tanks</span> often consist of large, circular steel or concrete enclosures. If you look closely, many tanks include a <span class="SmallCaps">level indicator</span> on the outside to show the water level at a glance. Some cities use ground excavations to form ponds called <span class="SmallCaps">finished water reservoirs</span> that hold significant volumes at a relatively low cost. These ponds are often lined with plastic or concrete to prevent leakage and are covered to minimize the chance of contamination (although some uncovered reservoirs still exist today). Both ground-level tanks and reservoirs can often be seen at water treatment plants, where they are known as <em>clearwells</em>.</p>
<p>One disadvantage of storing water at ground level is that it is not pressurized and therefore must be pumped into a distribution system, fluctuating water demands. Tanks or reservoirs are often installed at the tops of hills or mountainsides above the area served by the system, allowing storage not only of the water but also the energy imparted to it by the pumps. <em>Elevated storage</em> smooths the demands on pumps, allowing them to run <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_184" title="184"/>consistently instead of cycling on and off to meet changing water demands throughout the day. In some areas where electricity costs vary, pumps can run at night when power is cheap to fill up tanks, and be left off during peak hours when electricity is more expensive. Elevated storage is also beneficial during an electrical outage or emergency, keeping pipes pressurized and water flowing even when the pumps or treatment plant is out of service.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all cities have hills or mountains on which water tanks can be built. Smaller distribution systems often use tall, narrow tanks called <span class="SmallCaps">standpipes</span> for potable water storage. The water at the top of the tank serves as elevated storage just as if it were sitting on a hilltop. The water at the bottom of the tank serves as an emergency reserve that can be pumped into the distribution system if needed. Large cities often use elevated storage tanks, also known as <em>water towers</em>, that have their entire storage volume well above the minimum system pressure.</p>
<p>Choosing the height of a storage tank is an important decision. Distribution systems must be maintained within a window of acceptable water pressures. Too low, and you risk potential contamination. Too high, and you risk damage to pipelines and equipment.</p>
<p>The pressure in a body of water is related to the depth below the surface. You can imagine a water distribution system as a virtual ocean under which we all live. The water surface in elevated storage tanks represents the surface of the virtual ocean (called the <span class="SmallCaps">hydraulic grade line</span> by engineers). Customers at low elevations are at the bottom of the virtual ocean, where pressures are highest, and customers at high elevations will be near the surface of the virtual ocean where pressure is lowest. The ideal depth is usually around 30 to 60 meters (approximately 100 to 200 feet), which means most water towers are set so that their <span class="SmallCaps">low </span>and<span class="SmallCaps"> high water levels</span> are within this range. Water stored less than 15 meters (around 50 feet) above the system may not create enough pressure to prevent potential contamination. Cities with large changes in elevation sometimes maintain independent water distribution networks at different pressures to keep customers within the ideal range.</p>
<p>A water tower is as simple as a tank connected to a <span class="SmallCaps">water main</span>. When water demands fall below the pump capacity, the pressure in the system goes up, forcing water into the tank through the <span class="SmallCaps">inlet/outlet pipe</span>. When demands rise above the pumping rate, the system pressure goes down, and water flows out of the tank through the same pipe to supplement water from the treatment plant. Other than water, there’s not much inside. Most tanks feature an <span class="SmallCaps">overflow </span>to prevent them from overfilling. <span class="SmallCaps">Vents</span> make sure that the air pressure in the tank doesn’t change with the water level, potentially creating positive or negative pressure that could damage the structure. <span class="SmallCaps">Access hatches</span> provide means for maintenance and inspection inside the tank.</p>
<p>Water towers come in a wide variety of designs. They’re most often described <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_185" title="185"/>either by the shape of the tank itself or the tower structure on which it sits. <span class="SmallCaps">Single-pedestal tanks</span> and <span class="SmallCaps">multicolumn tanks</span> are usually made entirely from welded steel. <span class="SmallCaps">Fluted-column tanks</span> are supported by corrugated steel with lots of room inside the tower for equipment storage and sometimes even offices. <span class="SmallCaps">Composite tanks</span> sit upon concrete towers, saving the cost of regular painting required for steel columns to protect against corrosion. For cities that use elevated storage, these tanks are often a central part of operating the entire system. The water level in the tank is the primary indicator that the distribution system is pressurized to the right level and functioning as designed to deliver clean water to each individual customer.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">In large cities, it’s not unusual for buildings to be so tall that the main water pressure cannot deliver water to the top. Most tall buildings have their own system of pumps and tanks to ensure that each floor has adequate water pressure. Some cities require buildings to have a rooftop tank and pump, effectively spreading out the elevated storage across an urban area (rather than having centralized large towers). These rooftop tanks are often constructed from wood because it’s inexpensive and provides insulation against freezing. Steel bands hold the wooden boards tight against the pressure of the water inside. The bands’ spacing decreases toward the bottom of the tank, where the pressure is highest.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c07-0008"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_187" title="187"/>Sanitary Sewers and Lift Stations</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Humans are kind of gross. We collectively create a constant stream of waste that threatens city dwellers with deadly diseases unless it’s safely carried away. A lot of technical challenges are involved with getting so much poop from point A to point B, and the fact that we do it primarily out of sight and mind, I think, is cause for celebration. <em>Sanitary sewers</em> convert that figurative stream into a literal one that flows belowground away from public view (and hopefully public smell). The original sewers were simply rivers and creeks into which waste was thrown to be carried away downstream. That method of managing sewage had some obvious limitations, including that it contaminated sources of water that were often used for drinking. Modern sewers are almost always installed as pipes below the ground to keep waste streams separate from drinking water sources, but they still function much like the watercourses on the surface. </p>
<p>Sewers rely on gravity to do the work of collecting and transporting waste, flowing downward, converging, and concentrating into larger and larger streams. Sanitary sewer networks are <em>dendritic</em> with small pipes at individual buildings concentrating into larger and larger lines until all the wastewater converges at a single treatment plant. Pipes that service individual buildings are usually called <span class="SmallCaps">laterals</span>, and those servicing particular streets are <span class="SmallCaps">branches</span>. Larger pipes that collect wastewater from multiple branches are called <span class="SmallCaps">main sewers</span> or <em>trunk sewers</em>. The most significant lines and the farthest downstream in the system are usually called <em>interceptors</em>.</p>
<p>Sloping sewers to flow naturally downhill is convenient because we don’t have to pay a gravity bill, and it doesn’t get knocked out during a thunderstorm. However, relying only on gravity also constrains sewer design and construction. If the sewage flows too quickly, it can damage joints and erode the walls of the pipes. However, if the sewage flows too slowly, solids can settle out of suspension and build into clogs and constrictions. We can’t adjust gravity up or down to maintain this balance of flow velocity, and we also don’t have much control over the volume of wastewater (since people flush when they flush). The only factors engineers can control are the size of the sewer pipe and its <span class="SmallCaps">slope</span>. Each sewer line is carefully sized and sloped according to the expected quantity of wastewater to keep it flowing steadily toward a treatment plant.</p>
<p>Any time the size or direction of a sewer changes and at intersections of pipes, a <span class="SmallCaps">sanitary manhole</span> is installed to provide access for maintenance and inspection. Manholes are usually made from vertical concrete enclosures that run up to the ground surface. Steps allow personnel to enter and exit. A heavy cast iron plate, called a <span class="SmallCaps">cover</span>, keeps people and debris out of the sewers while allowing vehicles to drive over the top. Manholes also sometimes serve as vents to equalize the air pressure within the lines and prevent the buildup of toxic <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_188" title="188"/>gases. When the top of a maintenance hole is vulnerable to flooding, cities often require that the cover be sealed and bolted shut to exclude rainwater from entering the pipes. In this case, <span class="SmallCaps">vents</span> sometimes extend above the required flood level to keep air pressure from building up, even during heavy storms. A temporary <span class="SmallCaps">ventilation system</span> is used whenever someone enters a manhole to provide fresh air during repairs or maintenance.</p>
<p>Because sewers must always slope, they often end up well below the ground surface, especially toward their downstream ends, making construction costly and time-consuming. In some cases, it isn’t feasible to chase the slope of a sewer farther and farther below the ground surface. One alternative is to install a pumping station that can lift raw sewage from its depths back up and closer to the surface. <span class="SmallCaps">Lift stations</span> can be small installations designed to handle a few apartment complexes or massive projects that pump significant portions of a city’s wastewater flow. A typical wastewater lift station consists of a concrete chamber called a <span class="SmallCaps">wet well</span>. Sewage flows into the wet well by gravity via the <span class="SmallCaps">inlet sewer</span>, filling it over time. Once the level reaches a prescribed depth, a <span class="SmallCaps">pump</span> turns on, pushing the wastewater into a pipe called a <span class="SmallCaps">force main</span>. This intermittent operation makes sure that sewage is always moving swiftly through the line so that solids don’t settle out of suspension during off-peak hours. The sewage travels under pressure within the force main to an uphill manhole where it can once again continue its journey downward via gravity. Lift stations usually feature multiple pumps so that they can continue operating if one fails. They often have backup generators so that the sewage can continue to flow even if grid power is lost.</p>
<p>We often think of sewage as its grossest constituents: human excrement. But sewage is a slurry of liquids and solids from a wide variety of sources. Lots of stuff ends up in our wastewater stream, including soil, soap, hair, food, wipes, grease, and trash. These things may make it down the toilet or sink drain and through the plumbing in your house with no problem. However, in the sewer system, they can conglomerate into large balls of debris (sometimes called <em>pigtails</em> or <em>fatbergs</em> by wastewater professionals). In addition, with many cities putting efforts into water conservation, the concentration of solids in wastewater is trending upward. Conventional pumps handle liquids just fine, but adding solids in the stream increases the challenge of lifting raw sewage. Pumps used in wastewater lift stations are designed for extra wear and tear, but no pump is entirely clog-proof.</p>
<p>One solution to the problem of clogging is to use a screen in the lift station wet well to prevent trash from reaching the pumps. Every so often, the garbage caught in the mesh must be removed from the wet well and hauled away to a landfill. Smaller lift stations often use a <span class="SmallCaps">basket screen</span> on rails that can be manually lifted through an <span class="SmallCaps">access hatch</span> at the surface. Larger pump stations may have automatic systems that remove solids from the screen into a dumpster. Another solution to debris in the wastewater stream is to grind it into smaller <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_189" title="189"/>pieces. Some lift stations feature <em>grinders</em> that chew through debris so it can’t clog the pumps, minimizing the need for staff to visit the station to perform repairs or remove trash. The solids remain in the wastewater stream to be removed farther down the line at a treatment plant (discussed in the next section).</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Most sanitary systems are separated from storm drains, which carry away rainfall and snowmelt. However, precipitation can still make its way into the sewage system. <em>Inflow and infiltration</em> (often simplified as <em>I&amp;I</em>) are the enemies of utility providers for one simple reason: precipitation finding its way into sewers can overwhelm the system’s capacity during storms. I&amp;I can lead to overflows that create exposure to raw sewage and environmental problems, so municipalities work hard to find and repair defects that allow rainwater to enter the sewers. Cities often perform regular inspections of sewer lines using video cameras that can travel through the pipes on remotely controlled vehicles. Another type of inspection involves introducing nontoxic smoke into sewers as a way to detect sources of I&amp;I. The smoke can be seen escaping through openings and defects, allowing for visual identification of cracks, breaks, faulty manhole seals, and illicitly connected stormwater drains.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c07-0009"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_191" title="191"/>Wastewater Treatment Plants</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Water gets along with nearly every substance on Earth, which is a significant part of why it does such an excellent job of carrying our wastes away from homes and businesses in sewers. Before modern environmental regulations, it was not uncommon for a city to discharge <span class="SmallCaps">raw sewage</span> into rivers to be carried away downstream. Now nearly all wastewater collection systems rely on some kind of treatment plant to reverse the dirtying process, removing contaminants from the water so it can be reused or released back into the environment. Technology continues to evolve, and a wide variety of processes are used in wastewater treatment around the world. This section discusses some of the most common treatment methods modern wastewater plants use. If you can cope with the smell, many municipal treatment plants are happy to offer tours to the public where you can see each process in action.</p>
<p>Wastewater treatment plants use many discrete steps in the process of cleaning sewage. Many of these steps are similar to those used in drinking water treatment plants (discussed previously). However, the standards are generally lower since processed water (called <span class="SmallCaps">effluent</span>) will not be used for human consumption but only must be safe enough to release into the environment. The initial steps in a water treatment plant, called <em>primary treatment</em>, involve the physical separation of contaminants that are suspended in the swift and turbulent flow. First, sewage flows through a <span class="SmallCaps">bar screen</span> that filters out large debris like sticks, rags, and any other large pieces of detritus that find their way into the sewers. Many technologies exist, including bar screens equipped with automated <span class="SmallCaps">rakes</span> that scrape the filtered debris into a <span class="SmallCaps">bin</span> to be discarded as solid waste.</p>
<p>Next, suspended particles are separated from the flow. Sand and soil found in wastewater are collectively known as <em>grit</em>. These materials can damage equipment in the plant, so they are usually removed in a separate process during primary treatment. Treatment plants use <span class="SmallCaps">grit chambers</span>, often configured as long narrow tanks, to slow down wastewater flow. Within these placid conditions, suspended sediments will settle to the bottom of the chamber while the grit-free wastewater continues to the outlet. Some grit chambers introduce air bubbles that help fling heavier particles to the edges of the tank. Others use a motorized agitator to create a vortex in the flow to accomplish a similar feat. A <span class="SmallCaps">sump</span> at the bottom of the chamber collects the settled grit to be pumped away for disposal.</p>
<p>The final step in primary treatment is also usually a gravity process. Wastewater leaving the grit chamber is still full of suspended solids, but they mainly consist of small, organic particles or floating oils and grease (collectively known as <em>scum</em>). Most treatment plants use <span class="SmallCaps">primary clarifiers</span> to separate these remaining solids. The large circular tanks slow down wastewater flow even further, allowing tiny particles to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_192" title="192"/>sink gently while a <span class="SmallCaps">skimmer</span> collects the solids floating on the surface. The solids are sent for further processing, and the clarified wastewater exits over a <span class="SmallCaps">weir</span> into the secondary treatment process.</p>
<p>Where primary treatment physically separates contaminants from wastewater, <em>secondary treatment</em> does so using biological processes, replicating what Mother Nature would do naturally but in a much shorter time period. Most wastewater treatment plants take advantage of microorganisms that can digest organic matter in sewage. As they consume contaminants, these bacteria and protozoa clump together, leaving relatively clean water behind. The microorganism communities that thrive in oxygen-rich (<em>aerobic</em>) environments are different from those that live in oxygen-depleted (<em>anaerobic</em>) environments. These various colonies consume different nutrients from the water, so treatment plants often utilize both aerobic and anaerobic conditions to remove wastewater contaminants thoroughly. Aerobic conditions are created in <span class="SmallCaps">aeration basins</span> where blowers generate a constant supply of air that passes through <span class="SmallCaps">diffusers</span>, creating tiny bubbles that mix and dissolve oxygen into the water.</p>
<p>Once the biological treatment has consumed most of the nutrients, the cleaned water with suspended clumps of <span class="SmallCaps">microorganisms</span> (called <span class="SmallCaps">mixed liquor</span>) moves from the aeration chamber into a <span class="SmallCaps">secondary clarifier</span>. Here, the colonies of bacteria settle to the bottom, allowing only the clean effluent to be discharged. Depending on the regulatory requirements, many treatment plants have tertiary processes that target specific contaminants. In addition, most treatment plants perform a final <span class="SmallCaps">disinfection</span> to kill any remaining pathogens in the water. Disinfection may be completed using dissolved chlorine, ozone gas, or intense <span class="SmallCaps">ultraviolet lights,</span> which deactivate viruses and harmful bacteria. The final effluent from the treatment plant is usually discharged into a natural stream, river, or ocean.</p>
<p>Some of the microorganisms that settle out in the secondary clarifier (known as <span class="SmallCaps">activated sludge</span>) are returned to the aeration chamber to seed the next colony. The rest of the sludge must be discarded. Some treatment plants send sludge directly to a landfill for disposal. However, sludge is an organic material and will decompose over time, releasing unwanted gases like methane into the environment. Rather than allow such decomposition to occur in a landfill, many treatment plants use <span class="SmallCaps">digesters</span> to process organic solids. Digesters convert sludge into <span class="SmallCaps">biogas</span>, which can be used as a fuel for heating or electricity generation, and a solid material called <span class="SmallCaps">digestate</span> (or <em>biosolids</em>), which can be dried and landfilled or used as fertilizer. Digesters often have <span class="SmallCaps">mixers</span> to keep sludge blended, large domes to collect biogas as it is generated, and a <span class="SmallCaps">flare</span> that serves as a safety measure. If too much biogas is created than can be stored, operators will allow the gas to combust in the flare, converting the harmful constituents into safer gases to be released into the environment.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Raw sewage is 99.9 percent water, and water is a valuable resource to cities. In places where water is scarce, it can be cost-effective to treat municipal wastewater beyond what would typically be required so that it can be reused instead of discarded. A few places across the world use <em>direct potable reuse</em> (colloquially known as <em>toilet-to-tap</em>) where sewage is cleaned to drinking water–quality standards and reintroduced to the distribution system. However, most recycled water is not meant for human consumption. Plenty of uses do not require potable water, including industrial processes and the irrigation of golf courses, athletic fields, and parks. Many wastewater treatment plants are now considered water reclamation plants because, instead of discharging effluent to a stream or river, they pump it to customers that can use it, hopefully reducing demands on the potable water supply as a result. In many countries, purple pipes are used to distinguish non-potable water distribution systems, helping to prevent cross-connections. In addition, users of recycled water will often post signs warning the public that irrigation water is not safe to drink.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">One of the most significant environmental impacts of cities is how they affect the ways water moves above and below the ground during storms. All those streets, sidewalks, buildings, and parking lots cover the ground with impervious surfaces so that, instead of rainwater infiltrating, it runs off toward creeks and rivers, swelling them faster and higher and filling them with more pollution. Where a natural watershed acts like a sponge to absorb and slow rainwater as it falls, urban watersheds work more like funnels, gathering and concentrating runoff. Stormwater and flooding have been a problem ever since people started living in cities, and the first solution was simply to get the water out and away as quickly as possible. This solution is in the name we still use for how cities manage storms: <em>drainage</em>. When it rains and when it pours, we try to give that runoff somewhere to go.</p>
<p>Most cities are organized such that the streets serve as the first path of flow for rainfall. Individual lots are graded with a slope toward the road so that water flows away from buildings where it would otherwise cause problems. The standard city street has a <span class="SmallCaps">crown</span> in the center with <span class="SmallCaps">gutters</span> on either side for water to flow. This keeps the road mainly dry and safe for vehicle travel while providing a channel to convey <span class="SmallCaps">runoff</span>. Eventually, the road will reach a natural low point and start back uphill or will have collected so much runoff that it can’t hold it all in the gutter. It is possible to let runoff from a street outfall directly into a natural watercourse in some cases. However, in dense urban areas where space is limited, stormwater is often routed into underground drains.</p>
<p>In the past, it was common to simply put all the runoff from the streets directly into the sanitary sewage system. Unfortunately, wastewater treatment plants are usually not designed to process massive influxes of combined sewage and stormwater runoff at the whims of Mother Nature. In the worst cases, these plants have to release untreated sewage directly into watercourses when the inflow is too much to be stored or processed. That’s why most cities now separate <span class="SmallCaps">storm sewers</span> from the <span class="SmallCaps">sanitary sewers</span> used to carry wastewater. Rain usually enters a storm sewer system through a <span class="SmallCaps">curb inlet</span> or surface grate. Inlets are located at all low points along a road (called <em>sags</em>) and at regular spacing on sloped sections. Many inlets include a <span class="SmallCaps">manhole</span> so that they can be accessed for cleaning and maintenance. A storm sewer pipe connects to each inlet to carry rainwater away. Each line is sized and sloped for gravity flow according to the expected volume of stormwater, similar to how sanitary sewer pipes are designed to carry a specific volume of wastewater.</p>
<p>A storm sewer system converges and concentrates just like a natural system of streams and rivers. Eventually, the sewers are routed to an <span class="SmallCaps">outfall</span> in a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_196" title="196"/>natural watercourse or the ocean. Energy-dissipating <span class="SmallCaps">baffle blocks</span> or <span class="SmallCaps">rock riprap</span> armoring are often installed at outfalls to protect the natural soils against erosion from the swiftly exiting runoff. Unlike a sanitary sewer system that terminates in a treatment plant, most stormwater runoff is discharged directly into the environment, so cities often include warnings to the public about disposing of waste in curb inlets.</p>
<p>Storm sewers help reduce local flooding by quickly removing water from streets, conveying it to streams and rivers. However, the influx of stormwater from urban areas exacerbates flooding within these natural water bodies. Many cities increase the capacity of natural watercourses by enlarging, straightening, and lining them with concrete. This design strategy is often known as <em>channelization</em>. Speeding up stormwater flow through channelization helps reduce the depth and extents of flooding, but it also has disadvantages. Dirty concrete channels hurt the visual character of a city. Channelization can also worsen flooding downstream and degrade the habitat of the original waterway. Most cities recognize that widening and lining natural channels is an incomplete solution to the increased runoff from urban development.</p>
<p>As a result, cities now require developers to take responsibility for their own impacts on stormwater volume and quality, which usually involves onsite storage before releasing drainage into a watercourse. <em>Retention ponds</em> maintain a permanent pool of water where <span class="SmallCaps">detention ponds</span> are ordinarily dry. Both act like mini sponges, absorbing all the rain that rushes off the buildings, streets, and parking lots. Their <span class="SmallCaps">outlet structures</span> are designed to slowly release runoff back into waterways, shaving off the peak flow rate to the level before all the buildings and parking lots were built. Retention and detention ponds also help reduce pollution by slowing down the water, so suspended particles can settle out.</p>
<p>Along highways, it is not usually economical to manage stormwater below the ground. Instead, we often build highways above the natural ground on <span class="SmallCaps">embankments</span> with parallel ditches to carry stormwater. When a roadway crosses over a significant stream or river, we often construct a bridge. However, it isn’t cost-effective to bridge over every minor channel and topographic depression in the landscape. When a roadway intersects with a minor watercourse, a <span class="SmallCaps">culvert</span> allows water to cross below from one side to the other. Engineers select the culvert pipe size to reduce the possibility of rainwater overtopping the roadway. <span class="SmallCaps">Headwalls</span> and <span class="SmallCaps">wingwalls</span> hold the embankment back while guiding stormwater into the culvert. A poorly designed culvert can let water through while obstructing the movement of animals, so engineers work with biologists and environmental scientists to ensure that culverts are appropriately designed for both the water they must carry and the creatures that live within it.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Municipal drainage infrastructure has come a long way, but it still primarily treats stormwater as a waste product, something to be gotten rid of. The reality is that rainwater is a resource, and natural watersheds provide many more services than simply conveying runoff downstream. They serve as habitat for wildlife, clean and filter runoff with natural vegetation, divert rain into the subsurface to recharge aquifers, and reduce flooding by slowing down the water at the source rather than letting it quickly wash away and concentrate. Many cities are moving toward ways to replicate and re-create natural watershed functions within developed areas. In the United States, practices that reduce the volume of runoff and the pollution it carries by managing it close to the source are collectively called <em>low impact development</em>. They include strategies like rain gardens, vegetated rooftops, permeable pavements, strips of vegetation used to filter surface runoff, and other ways to harmonize the built environment and its original hydrological and ecological functions. Low impact development can also include better floodplain management by using land for purposes that are less vulnerable to flooding, such as parks and trails.</p>

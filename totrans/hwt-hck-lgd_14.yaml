- en: With Mimikatz running unchallenged on our target servers, after a few hours
    we find we’ve collected credentials for around 25 accounts. This is a pretty decent
    number given the limited set of compromised assets. We map these compromised user
    accounts to their respective groups based on the reconnaissance we did in Chapter
    6, but we still don’t have any users from the *TYRION*, *TYWIN*, or *BAELISH*
    groups. To complete the picture, we must explore further. Peering at our Citrix
    dashboard, we notice something that might yield yet more treasures . . .

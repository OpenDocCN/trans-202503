<p class="BodyFirst">Thanks to Romain Guy, without whom this book would never have happened. Not only did he bring me onto the team (even having to try twice before it actually worked), but he was instrumental in helping me develop the ideas of the book (some of which came from presentations we’ve given together at tech conferences). He also assisted in many of the interviews I conducted for the book. Oh, and he wrote a lot of the code that many of us still work on and billions of people use today.</p>
<p>Thanks to my wife Kris, for her thoughtful insights and assistance in the very-early and very-late stages of this project, along with her expert editorial feedback many times along the way. Also, thanks for not killing me for allowing the project to dominate our home lives for so very, very long. It’s done now. I think.</p>
<p>Thanks to Tor Norbye, my long-time co-host (along with Romain) for <em>Android Developers Backstage</em>,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f07-footnote-3" id="f07-footnoteref-3">2</a></sup> a podcast where we talk to other Android developers about how Android works. Some of the interviews we’ve done (including those with Ficus Kirkpatrick, Mathias Agopian, and Dave Burke) contributed directly to this story, since they were about Android history. But all of them contributed to my love of talking to people about what they do that became the genesis, heart, and soul of this project.</p>
<p>Thanks to Dan Sandler for his excellent, fun artwork adorning the cover and pages of this book. I always enjoyed seeing his cartoons left like fingerprints on whiteboards when he would visit the Mt. View offices and I love seeing his drawings here, capturing the playfulness in the team and the product.</p>
<p>Thanks to Gretchen Achilles, friend and book designer extraordinaire, for helping to craft the book into shape for publication.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xvi" title="xvi"/>Thanks to Jonathan Littman, author of several successful books, who patiently answered my questions about how things work in the real world of books, authors, and publishers.</p>
<p>Thanks to my editor Laureen Hudson, without whom this book would be a lot less polished, pulled together, cleaned up, and generally readable. I first worked with Laureen on technical articles I wrote (and she edited) while we were at Sun Microsystems many years ago. It was a pleasure to renew that relationship and have her return to clean up my messes once again.</p>
<p>And a special callout to Dave Burke, VP of Android engineering at Google. Dave agreed that this was a story worth telling and helped me cross the hurdles that tend to crop up when telling a story from the inside about a company, its people, and its products.</p>
<p>Apologies to all of those people who also helped out building Android in those early days whom I didn’t get a chance to talk to. I would happily have carried on doing interview after interview (by far the most fun part of the entire project), learning about the people, what they worked on, where they came from, and how they helped create this thing. But at some point, I needed to actually finish the book.</p>
<p>And thanks to all of the Android employees, past and present, who selflessly gave of their time, opinions, and stories, so that I could better tell the story of what actually happened way back then. I’d particularly like to thank everyone that helped out with interviews, both conversational and through email. Nearly everyone I asked was not only willing to put up with my questions, but was enthusiastic about the project and our conversations.</p>
<p>Though the story of Android goes beyond the people I directly interviewed, talked to, emailed, or otherwise bothered, I wanted to explicitly thank the people who spent time helping me get the facts and possibly completely fabricated stories correct: Mathias Agopian, Dan Bornstein, Cédric Beust, Irina Blok, Bob Borchers, Dave Bort, Dave Burke, Chiu-Ki Chan, Mike Chan, Cary Clark, Mike Cleron, Tracey Cole, Chris DiBona, Dirk Dougherty, Xavier Ducrohet, Dan Egnor, Eric Fischer, Mike Fleming, Bruce Gay, Debajit Ghosh, Ryan PC Gibson, Romain Guy, Dianne Hackborn, Jeff Hamilton, Ed Heyl, Arve Hjønnevåg, Steve Horowitz, Wei Huang, Brian Jones, Ficus Kirkpatrick, Grace Kloba, Bob Lee, Dan Lew, Hiroshi Lockheimer, Iliyan Malchev, Andy McFadden, San Mehat, Charles Mendis, Evan Millar, Rich Miner, Dan <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xvii" title="xvii"/>Morrill, Michael Morrissey, Tom Moss, Marco Nelissen, Joe Onorato, Jason Parks, Nick Pelly, Andrei Popescu, Jean-Baptiste Quéru, Mike Reed, Nicolas Roard, Andy Rubin, Dan Sandler, Nick Sears, Jeff Sharkey, Dave Sparks, Brian Swetland, David Turner, Paul Whitton, Jesse Wilson, Peisun Wu, Jeff Yaksick, and Rebecca Zavin.</p>
<p>I’d also like to thank the many people who took the time to read the draft and offer feedback. Code is always better for being reviewed, and so is this book. I would particularly like to call out the significant efforts of a few of the people who carefully went through the entire thing, identified gaps, caught redundancies, corrected mistakes, provided additional information, and generally added hugely to the final product by their careful review of the manuscript. I’m pretty sure that there was another entire book written in the feedback comment threads of this book. In particular, Dianne Hackborn, Brian Swetland, and Andy McFadden were all incredibly responsive, thoughtful, and complete in their reviews, which helped with the technical accuracy of the result. Also, thanks to my friend Alan Walendowski for an eleventh-hour read and review that helped catch lingering issues that are so difficult to see after re-reading and re-editing the same text so very, very many times.</p>
<p>Thank you all. Thank you, thank you, thank you, and apologies for all of the details that I got just slightly, maddeningly wrong. Please file a bug.</p>

<p class="noindentz">In the previous chapter, you learned about Boolean algebra expressions and how to implement them using logic gates. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to implement logic gates in hardware using <em>transistors</em>, the solid-state electronic devices used to implement the on/off switches we’ve been discussing so far in this book.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To help you to understand how transistors operate, we’ll start with a simple introduction to electronics. From there, you’ll learn how transistors can be connected in pairs to switch faster and use less electrical power. We’ll end the chapter with some practical considerations regarding the use of transistors to construct logic gates.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec1"><strong>Crash Course in Electronics</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You don’t need to be an electrical engineer to understand how logic gates work, but some understanding of the basic concepts can be helpful. In this <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_86"/>section, I provide a brief overview of the fundamental concepts of electronic circuits. We’ll begin with two definitions:</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><strong>Current</strong>   Refers to the movement of electrical charge. Electrical charge is measured in <em>coulombs (C)</em>. A flow of 1 C per second (1 C/s) is defined as 1 <em>ampere (A)</em>, often abbreviated as <em>amp</em>. Current flows through an electrical circuit only if there is a completely connected path from one side of the power source to the other.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><strong>Voltage</strong>   Also called <em>potential difference</em>, refers to the difference in electrical energy per unit charge between two points in an electrical circuit. One <em>volt (V)</em> is defined as the electrical difference between two points on a <em>conductor</em> (the medium the current flows through) when 1 A of current flowing through the conductor dissipates 1 watt (W) of power.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin">A computer is constructed from the following electronic components:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Power sources that provide the electrical power</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Passive components that affect current flow and voltage levels but whose characteristics cannot be altered by another electronic component</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Active components that switch between various combinations of the power source, passive components, and other active components under the control of one or more other electronic components</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Conductors that connect the other components</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s look at how each of these electronic components works.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch05lev2sec1"><em><strong>Power Supplies and Batteries</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In almost all countries, electrical power comes in the form of <em>alternating current (AC)</em>. For AC, a plot of the magnitude of the voltage versus time shows a sinusoidal wave shape. Computer circuits use <em>direct current (DC)</em> power, which, unlike AC, does not vary over time. A power supply is used to convert AC to DC, as shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig1">Figure 5-1</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch5fig1" src="../images/pg114_Image_125.jpg" alt="Image" width="627" height="95"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 5-1: An AC/DC power supply</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Batteries also provide DC electrical power. When drawing circuits, we’ll use the symbol for a battery (<a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig2">Figure 5-2</a>) to designate a DC power supply. The power supply in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig2">Figure 5-2</a> provides 5 V DC.</p>&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_87"/>&#13;

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 5-2: The circuit symbol for a 5 V DC power source</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the previous chapters, you’ve seen that everything that happens in a computer is based on a system of <code>1</code>s and <code>0</code>s. But how are these <code>1</code>s and <code>0</code>s physically represented? Computer circuits distinguish between two different voltage levels to provide logical <code>0</code>s and <code>1</code>s. For example, logical <code>0</code> may be represented by 0 V DC and logical <code>1</code> by 5 V DC. The reverse could also be implemented: 5 V as logical <code>0</code> and 0 V as logical <code>1</code>. The only requirement is that the hardware design be consistent. Luckily, programmers don’t need to worry about the actual voltages used; that’s best left to the computer hardware engineers.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>Electronic devices are designed to operate reliably within a range of voltages. For example, a device designed to operate at a nominal 5 V typically has a tolerance of ±5%, or 4.75 to 5.25 V.</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">The components in a computer circuit constantly switch between the two voltage levels. Each voltage switch takes time, which limits how fast a given circuit can complete an operation. As you’ll see in the “Transistors” section on <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05lev1sec2">page 96</a>, speeding up the switching times uses more power, which creates heat. Excessive heat can damage the components, which limits the speed of calculations. The time-dependent characteristics of the circuit components are an important design consideration for computer hardware engineers. We’ll look at these characteristics in the next section.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch05lev2sec2"><em><strong>Passive Components</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">All electrical circuits have the following electromagnetic properties, which are distributed throughout the circuit:</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><strong>Resistance</strong>   Impedes current flow, thus dissipating energy. The electrical energy is transformed into heat.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><strong>Capacitance</strong>   Stores energy in an electric field. Voltage across a capacitance cannot change instantaneously.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin"><strong>Inductance</strong>   Stores energy in a magnetic field. Current through an inductance cannot change instantaneously.</p>&#13;
<p class="indenta">It takes time for energy to be stored as an electric field, so <em>capacitance impedes time changes in voltage</em>. And it takes time for energy to be stored as a magnetic field, so <em>inductance impedes time changes in current</em>. These two properties are lumped together with resistance and called <em>impedance</em>. The impedance to changes slows down the switching that takes place in a computer, and the resistance consumes electrical power. We’ll be looking at the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_88"/>general timing characteristics of these properties in the remainder of this section, but will leave a discussion of power consumption to more advanced books on the topic.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To get a feel for the effects of each of these properties, we’ll consider the discrete electronic devices that are used to place these properties in a specific location in a circuit: resistors, capacitors, and inductors. These are part of a broader class of electronic components called <em>passive components</em>, which cannot be controlled electronically; they simply consume or store energy. <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig3">Figure 5-3</a> shows the circuit symbols for the passive electronic devices we’ll be discussing here.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch5fig3" src="../images/pg116_Image_127.jpg" alt="Image" width="292" height="202"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 5-3: Circuit symbols for passive devices</em></p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch05lev3sec1"><strong>Switches</strong></h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A <em>switch</em> can be in one of two positions: open or closed. In the open position, there is no connection between the two ends, and no conduction occurs. When a switch is closed, the connection between the two ends is complete, thus conducting electricity. The symbol in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig3">Figure 5-3</a>(a) typically indicates a switch that is activated manually. In the section “Transistors” on <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05lev1sec2">page 96</a>, you’ll learn that a computer uses transistors for open/closed switches, which are controlled electronically, thus implementing the on/off logic that forms the basis of a computer.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch05lev3sec2"><strong>Resistors</strong></h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A <em>resistor</em> is used to limit the amount of current in a specific location in a circuit. By limiting the current flow into a capacitor or inductor, a resistor affects the time it takes for these other devices (discussed in “Capacitors” on <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05lev3sec3">page 90</a> and “Inductors” on <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05lev3sec4">page 93</a>) to build up their energy storage. The amount of resistance is usually chosen in conjunction with the amount of capacitance or inductance to provide specific timing characteristics. Resistors are also used to limit current flowing through a device to nondestructive levels.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As it limits current flow, a resistor irreversibly transforms the electrical energy into heat. A resistor doesn’t store energy, unlike a capacitor or inductor, which can return the stored energy to the circuit at a later time.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The relationship between voltage and current for a single resistor is given by <em>Ohm’s law</em>,</p>&#13;
<div class="image1"><img src="../images/pg116_Image_128.jpg" alt="Image" width="121" height="20"/></div>&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_89"/>&#13;
<p class="noindent">where <em>V</em>(<em>t</em>) is the voltage difference across the resistor at time <em>t</em>, <em>I</em>(<em>t</em>) is the current flowing through it at time <em>t</em>, and <em>R</em> is the value of the resistor. Resistor values are specified in <em>ohms</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The circuit shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig4">Figure 5-4</a> shows two resistors connected through a switch to a power supply, which supplies 5 V. The Greek letter Ω is used to indicate ohms, and kΩ indicates 10<sup>3</sup> Ω. Since current can flow only in a closed path, no current flows until the switch is closed.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch5fig4" src="../images/pg117_Image_129.jpg" alt="Image" width="361" height="135"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 5-4: Two resistors in series with a power supply and switch</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig4">Figure 5-4</a>, both resistors are in the same path, so when the switch is closed, the same current, <em>I</em>, flows through each of them. Resistors that are in the same current flow path are said to be <em>connected in series</em>. To determine the amount of current flowing from the power supply, we need to compute the total resistance in the path of the current. In this example, this is the sum of the two resistors:</p>&#13;
<div class="image1"><img src="../images/pg117_Image_130.jpg" alt="Image" width="173" height="47"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Thus, the 5 V is applied across a total of 2.5 kΩ. Solving for <em>I</em>, and leaving out <em>t</em> because the power supply voltage doesn’t vary with time, we get</p>&#13;
<div class="image1"><img src="../images/pg117_Image_131.jpg" alt="Image" width="144" height="156"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">where mA is milliamps.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We can now determine the voltage difference between points A and B in the circuit in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig4">Figure 5-4</a> by multiplying the resistor value and current:</p>&#13;
<div class="image1"><img src="../images/pg117_Image_132.jpg" alt="Image" width="206" height="47"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Similarly, the voltage difference between points B and C is:</p>&#13;
<div class="image1"><img src="../images/pg117_Image_133.jpg" alt="Image" width="206" height="46"/></div>&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_90"/>&#13;
<p class="indent">Thus, connecting the resistors in series serves as a <em>voltage divider</em>, dividing the 5 V between the two resistors: 2.0 V across the 1.0 kΩ resistor and 3.0 V across the 1.5 kΩ resistor.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig5">Figure 5-5</a> shows the same two resistors <em>connected in parallel</em>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch5fig5" src="../images/pg118_Image_134.jpg" alt="Image" width="342" height="185"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 5-5: Two resistors in parallel</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig5">Figure 5-5</a>, the full voltage of the power supply, 5 V, is applied across points A and C when the switch is closed. Thus, each resistor has 5 V applied across it, and we can use Ohm’s law to compute the current through each one:</p>&#13;
<div class="image1"><img src="../images/pg118_Image_135.jpg" alt="Image" width="154" height="328"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">The total current from the power supply when the switch is closed, <em>I<sub>T</sub></em> = <em>I</em><sub>1</sub> + <em>I</em><sub>2</sub>, is divided at point A to supply both resistors. It must equal the sum of the two currents through the resistors:</p>&#13;
<div class="image1"><img src="../images/pg118_Image_136.jpg" alt="Image" width="194" height="77"/></div>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch05lev3sec3"><strong>Capacitors</strong></h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A <em>capacitor</em> stores energy in the form of an <em>electric field</em>, which is essentially the electric charge at rest. A capacitor initially allows current to flow into it. But instead of providing a continuous path for the current flow, it stores the electric charge, creating an electric field and causing the current flow to decrease over time.</p>&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_91"/>&#13;
<p class="indent">Since it takes time for the electric field to build up, capacitors are often used to smooth out rapid changes in voltage. When there is a sudden increase in current flow into a capacitor, the capacitor tends to absorb the electric charge. Then, when the current flow suddenly decreases, the stored electric charge is released from the capacitor.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The voltage across a capacitor changes with time according to</p>&#13;
<div class="image1"><img src="../images/pg119_Image_137.jpg" alt="Image" width="150" height="67"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">where <em>V</em>(<em>t</em>) is the voltage difference across the capacitor at time <em>t</em>, <em>I</em>(<em>t</em>) is the current flowing through it at time <em>t</em>, and <em>C</em> is the value of the capacitor in <em>farads</em> (F).</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>In case you haven’t studied calculus, the</em> ∫ <em>symbol represents</em> integration, <em>which can be thought of as “infinitesimal summation.” This equation says that the voltage sums up as time increases from 0 to the current time,</em> t. <em>You’ll see a graphic view of this in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig7">Figure 5-7</a>.</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig6">Figure 5-6</a> shows a 1.0 microfarad (μF) capacitor being charged through a 1.0 kΩ resistor.</p>&#13;

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 5-6: A capacitor in series with a resistor</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As you will see later in this chapter, this circuit is a rough simulation of the output of one transistor connected to the input of another. The output of the first transistor (which acts like the power supply plus resistor in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig6">Figure 5-6</a>) has resistance, and the input to the second transistor has capacitance. The switching behavior of the second transistor depends upon the voltage across the (equivalent) capacitor, <em>V<sub>BC</sub></em>(<em>t</em>), reaching a threshold value.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s look at the time it takes for the voltage across the capacitor to reach a threshold value. Assuming the voltage across the capacitor, <em>V<sub>BC</sub></em>, is 0 V when the switch is first closed, current flows through the resistor and into the capacitor. The voltage across the resistor plus the voltage across the capacitor must be equal to the voltage that is available from the power supply. That is:</p>&#13;
<div class="image1"><img src="../images/pg119_Image_139.jpg" alt="Image" width="166" height="20"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Starting with the voltage across the capacitor, <em>V<sub>BC</sub></em>, at 0 V, when the switch is first closed, the full 5.0 V of the power supply will appear across the resistor. Thus, the initial current flow in the circuit will be:</p>&#13;
<div class="image1"><img src="../images/pg119_Image_140.jpg" alt="Image" width="140" height="69"/></div>&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_92"/>&#13;
<p class="indent">This initial surge of current into the capacitor causes the voltage across the capacitor to build up toward the power supply voltage. The previous integral equation shows that this buildup decreases exponentially as the voltage across the capacitor approaches its final value.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As the voltage across the capacitor, <em>V<sub>BC</sub></em>(<em>t</em>), increases, the voltage across the resistor, <em>V<sub>AB</sub></em>(<em>t</em>), must decrease. When the voltage across the capacitor finally equals the voltage of the power supply, the voltage across the resistor is 0 V and the current flow in the circuit is zero. The rate of the exponential decrease in current flow is given by the product of the resistor value and the capacitor value, <em>RC</em>, called the <em>time constant</em>. For the values of <em>R</em> and <em>C</em> in this example, we get</p>&#13;
<div class="image1"><img src="../images/pg120_Image_141.jpg" alt="Image" width="342" height="98"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">where s is seconds and ms is milliseconds.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Assuming the capacitor in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig6">Figure 5-6</a> has 0 V across it when the switch is closed, the voltage that develops across the capacitor over time is given by:</p>&#13;
<div class="image1"><img src="../images/pg120_Image_142.jpg" alt="Image" width="236" height="77"/></div>&#13;

<p class="noindent">which is more than the threshold voltage of the typical transistors used in a computer. You’ll learn more about this later in the chapter.</p>&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_93"/>&#13;
<p class="indent">After six time constants have passed, the voltage across the capacitor is:</p>&#13;
<div class="image1"><img src="../images/pg121_Image_145.jpg" alt="Image" width="230" height="142"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">At this time, the voltage across the resistor is essentially 0 V and current flow is very low.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch05lev3sec4"><strong>Inductors</strong></h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">An <em>inductor</em> stores energy in the form of a <em>magnetic field</em>, which is created by electric charge in motion. An inductor initially prevents the flow of electrical charge, requiring time for the magnetic field to build. By providing a continuous path for the flow of electrical charge (current), an inductor creates the magnetic field.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In a computer, inductors are mainly used in the power supply and the circuitry that connects the power supply to the CPU. If you have access to the inside of a computer, you can likely see a small (about 1 cm diameter) donut-shaped device with wire wrapped around it on the motherboard near the CPU. This is an inductor used to smooth the power supplied to the CPU.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Although either an inductor or a capacitor can be used to smooth the power, the inductor does it by resisting current changes and the capacitor does it by resisting voltage changes. A discussion of which one, or both, to use for smoothing is beyond the scope of this book.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The relationship between voltage <em>V</em>(<em>t</em>) at time <em>t</em> across an inductor and current flow through it, <em>I</em>(<em>t</em>), is given by</p>&#13;
<div class="image1"><img src="../images/pg121_Image_146.jpg" alt="Image" width="122" height="46"/></div>&#13;

<p class="notep"><em>Again, we’re using some calculus here.

<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_94"/>&#13;
<p class="indent">When the switch is open, no current flows through this circuit. When it closes, the inductor initially impedes the flow of current, and it takes time for a magnetic field to be built up in the inductor. Before the switch is closed, no current is flowing through the resistor, so the voltage across it, <em>V<sub>BC</sub></em>, is 0 V. The voltage across the inductor, <em>V<sub>AB</sub></em>, is the full 5 V of the power supply. As current begins to flow through the inductor, the voltage across the resistor, <em>V<sub>BC</sub></em>(<em>t</em>), grows. This results in an exponentially decreasing voltage across the inductor. When the voltage across the inductor finally reaches 0 V, the voltage across the resistor is 5 V and current flow in the circuit is 5.0 mA.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The rate of the exponential voltage decrease is given by the time constant <em>L</em>/<em>R</em>. Using the values of <em>R</em> and <em>L</em> in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig8">Figure 5-8</a>, we get</p>&#13;

<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_95"/>&#13;
<p class="indent">After about 6 ns (six time constants), the voltage across the inductor is essentially equal to 0 V. At this time, the full voltage of the power supply is across the resistor and a steady current of 5.0 mA flows.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The circuit in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig8">Figure 5-8</a> shows how inductors can be used with a CPU power supply. The power supply in this circuit simulates the computer power supply, and the resistor simulates the CPU, which consumes the electrical energy from the power supply. The voltage produced by a power supply includes <em>noise</em>, which consists of small, high-frequency fluctuations added to the DC level. As shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig9">Figure 5-9</a>, the voltage supplied to the CPU, <em>V<sub>BC</sub></em>(<em>t</em>), changes little over short periods of time. The inductor connected in series between the power supply and the CPU acts to smooth out the voltage that powers the CPU.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch05lev2sec3"><em><strong>Power Consumption</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">An important part of hardware design is power consumption, especially in battery-powered devices. Of the three electromagnetic properties we’ve discussed here, resistance is the primary consumer of power.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>Energy</em> is the ability to cause change, and <em>power</em> is a measure of how fast energy can be used to make that change. The basic unit of energy is the <em>joule (J)</em>. The basic unit of power is the <em>watt (W)</em>, which is defined as expending 1 joule per second (J/s). For example, I have a backup battery that can store 240 watt-hours (Wh). That means it can store enough energy to provide 240 watts for 1 hour, or 240 Wh <em>×</em> 3,600 s/h = 864,000 J. The units for volt and ampere are defined such that 1 W = 1 V <em>×</em> 1 A. This gives rise to the formula for power,</p>&#13;

<p class="noindent">where <em>P</em> is the power used, <em>V</em> is the voltage across the component, and <em>I</em> is the current flowing through it.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">After a brief charging time, a capacitor prevents current flow. This equation shows that the power consumption of a capacitor then goes to zero. The energy used to charge the capacitor is stored in the form of an electrical field. Similarly, the voltage across an inductor goes to zero after a brief charging time, resulting in the amount of power consumed by the inductor going to zero. An inductor stores the charging energy in the form of a magnetic field.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">However, a resistor doesn’t store energy. As long as there is a voltage difference across a resistor, current flows through it.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The power used by a resistor, <em>R</em>, is given by:</p>&#13;
<div class="image1"><img src="../images/pg123_Image_153.jpg" alt="Image" width="129" height="96"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">This power is converted to heat in the resistor. Since power consumption increases by the square of the current, a common hardware design goal is to reduce the amount of current flow.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">This section has been an idealized discussion of the passive components that computer engineers include in their designs. In the real world, each component includes elements of all three characteristics—resistance, capacitance, and inductance—that the hardware design engineer needs to take into account. These secondary effects are subtle and often troublesome in the design.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The rest of this chapter is devoted to discussing the <em>active components</em>, which are controlled electronically and used to implement the switches that are the basis for a computer. As you will see, the active components include resistance and capacitance, which affect the design of the circuits they’re used in.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec2"><strong>Transistors</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="indent">In previous chapters, I described a computer as a collection of two-state switches and discussed how data can be represented by the settings, <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>, of these switches. Then we moved on to look at how <code>0</code>s and <code>1</code>s can be combined using logic gates to implement logical functions. In this section, you’ll learn how transistors can be used to implement the two-state switches that make up a computer.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A <em>transistor</em> is a device whose resistance can be controlled electronically, thus making it an active component. The ability to be controlled electronically is what distinguishes the switches made from transistors from the simple on/off switches you saw earlier in the chapter, which could be controlled mechanically. Before examining how a transistor can be used as a switch, let’s look at how we would implement a logic gate using mechanical on/off switches. We’ll use the NOT gate for this example.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig10">Figure 5-10</a> shows two push-button switches connected in series between 5 V and 0 V.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch5fig10" src="../images/pg124_Image_154.jpg" alt="Image" width="239" height="260"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 5-10: A NOT gate made from two push-button switches</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The top switch is normally closed. When its button is pushed (from the left side), the connection between the two small circles is broken, thus <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_97"/>opening the circuit at this point. The bottom switch is normally open. When its button is pushed, a connection is made between the two small circles, thus completing the circuit at this point.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We’ll let 5 V represent a <code>1</code> and 0 V a <code>0</code>. The input to this NOT gate, <em>x</em>, pushes the two buttons simultaneously. We will control <em>x</em> in the following way: when <em>x</em> = <code>1</code>, we’ll push the two buttons, and when <em>x</em> = <code>0</code>, we will not push the buttons. When the buttons are not pushed (<em>x</em> = <code>0</code>), the 5 V are connected to the output, ¬<em>x</em>, which represents <code>1</code>. When the buttons are pushed (<em>x</em> = <code>1</code>), the 5 V are disconnected and the 0 V, which represents <code>0</code>, are connected to the output. Thus, an input of <code>1</code> gets an output of <code>0</code> and an input of <code>0</code> gets an output of <code>1</code>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Early computing devices used mechanical switches to implement their logic, but the results were very slow by today’s standards. Modern computers use transistors, which are electronic devices made from semiconductor materials that can be switched quickly between their conducting and non-conducting states under electronic control.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Just as with the mechanically controlled push-button example, we use two different voltages to represent <code>1</code> and <code>0</code>. For example, we might use a high voltage, say +5 V, to represent <code>1</code> and a low voltage, say 0 V, to represent <code>0</code>. But transistors can be switched on or off electronically, which makes them much faster than the mechanical switches used in the original computers. Transistors also take up much less space and consume much less electrical power.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the following sections, we’ll look at two transistors commonly used in modern computers: the MOSFET switch and the CMOS switch.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch05lev2sec4"><em><strong>MOSFET Switch</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The most commonly used switching transistor in today’s computer logic circuits is the <em>metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET)</em>. There are several types of MOSFET, which use different voltage levels and polarities. I’ll describe the behavior of the most common type, the <em>enhancement-mode MOSFET</em>, and leave the details of the other variations to more advanced books on the topic. The brief discussion here will help you understand the basics of how they work.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The basic material in a MOSFET is typically silicon, which is a <em>semiconductor</em>, meaning it conducts electricity, but not very well. Its conductivity is improved by adding an impurity, a process called <em>doping</em>. Depending on the type of impurity, the electrical conductivity can be either the flow of electrons or the flow of lack of electrons (called <em>holes</em>). Since electrons have a negative electrical charge, the type that conducts electrons is called <em>N-type</em> and the type that conducts holes is called <em>P-type</em>. The main conduction path through a MOSFET is the <em>channel</em>, which is connected between the <em>source</em> and the <em>drain</em> terminals on the MOSFET. The <em>gate</em> is made from the opposite type of semiconductor and controls the conductivity through the channel.</p>&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_98"/>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig11">Figure 5-11</a> shows the two basic types of MOSFET: N-channel and P-channel. Here, I’ve shown each MOSFET connected to a 5 V power source through a resistor.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch5fig11" src="../images/pg126_Image_155.jpg" alt="Image" width="394" height="217"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 5-11: The two basic types of MOSFETs</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">These are simplified circuits, as the intention is just to provide context for discussing how MOSFETs work. Each MOSFET has three connection points, or <em>terminals</em>. The gate is used as the input terminal. Voltage applied to the gate, relative to the voltage applied to the source, controls current flow through the MOSFET. The drain is used as the output. The source of an N-channel MOSFET is connected to the lower voltage of the power supply, while the source of a P-channel is connected to the higher voltage.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">After learning about complements in Boolean algebra, it probably does not surprise you that the two types of MOSFETs have complementary behavior. You’ll see in the following sections how we can connect them in complementary pairs that make for faster, more efficient switches than using only one type.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">First, we’ll look at how each works as a single switching device, starting with the N-channel MOSFET.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch05lev3sec5"><strong>N-Channel MOSFET</strong></h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig11">Figure 5-11</a>(a), the drain of the N-channel MOSFET is connected to the 5 V side of the power supply through the resistor, R, and the source is connected to the 0 V side.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When the voltage applied to the gate is positive with respect to the source, the resistance between the drain and the source of the N-channel MOSFET decreases. When this voltage reaches a threshold value, typically in the range of 1 V, the resistance becomes very low, thus providing a good conduction path for current between the drain and the source. The resulting circuit is equivalent to <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig12">Figure 5-12</a>(a).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig12">Figure 5-12</a>(a), current flows from the 5 V connection of the power supply to the 0 V connection through the resistor, R. The voltage at the drain will be 0 V. A problem with this current flow is that the resistor consumes power, simply converting it to heat. In a moment, you’ll see the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_99"/>reason we don’t want to increase the amount of resistance to limit the current flow to reduce power consumption.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch5fig12" src="../images/pg127_Image_156.jpg" alt="Image" width="545" height="227"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 5-12: An N-channel MOSFET switch equivalent circuit: (a) switch closed, (b) switch open</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If the voltage applied to the gate is switched to be nearly the same as the voltage applied to the source—0 V in this example—the MOSFET turns off, resulting in the equivalent circuit shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig12">Figure 5-12</a>(b). The drain is typically connected to another MOSFET’s gate, which draws current only briefly as it switches from one state to the other. After this brief switching of state, the connection of the drain to another MOSFET’s gate does not draw current. Since no current flows through the resistor, there is no voltage difference across it. Thus, the voltage at the drain will be 5 V.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The resistor is said to be acting as the <em>pull-up device</em>, because when the MOSFET is turned off, the circuit is completed through the resistor, which acts to pull the voltage on the drain up to the higher voltage of the power supply.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch05lev3sec6"><strong>P-Channel MOSFET</strong></h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Now, let’s look at the P-channel MOSFET, shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig11">Figure 5-11</a>(b). The drain is connected to the lower voltage (0 V) through a resistor, R, and the source is connected to the higher-voltage power supply (5 V). When the voltage applied to the gate is switched to be nearly the same as the voltage applied to the source, the MOSFET turns off. In this case, the resistor acts as a <em>pull-down device</em> to pull the voltage on the drain down to 0 V. <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig13">Figure 5-13</a>(a) shows the equivalent circuit.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When the voltage applied to the gate is negative with respect to the source, the resistance between the drain and the source of the P-channel MOSFET decreases. When this voltage reaches a threshold value, typically in the range of –1 V, the resistance becomes very low, providing a good conduction path for current between the drain and the source. <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig13">Figure 5-13</a>(b) shows the resulting equivalent circuit when the gate is –5 V with respect to the source.</p>&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_100"/>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch5fig13" src="../images/pg128_Image_157.jpg" alt="Image" width="546" height="226"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 5-13: A P-channel MOSFET switch equivalent circuit: (a) switch open, (b) switch closed</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The resistors in the MOSFET circuits in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig11">Figures 5-11</a> present a couple of problems with both MOSFET types. We’ll look at those next.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch05lev3sec7"><strong>Resistors in MOSFET Circuits</strong></h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The equivalent circuits in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig12">Figures 5-12(a)</a> and <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig13">5-13(b)</a> show that the respective MOSFET in its on state acts like a closed switch, thus causing current to flow through the pull-up or pull-down resistor. The current flow through the resistor when the MOSFET is in its on state consumes power that is simply converted to heat.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In addition to the pull-up and pull-down resistors using power when a MOSFET is in its on state, there’s another problem with this hardware design. Although the gate of a MOSFET draws essentially no current to remain in either an on or an off state, a brief burst of current into the gate is required to change its state. That current is supplied by the device connected to the gate, probably from the drain of another MOSFET. I won’t go into details in this book, but the amount of current that can be supplied at the drain from this other MOSFET is largely limited by its pull-up or pull-down resistor. The situation is essentially the same as that in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig6">Figures 5-6</a> and <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig7">5-7</a>, where you saw that the time it takes to charge a capacitor is longer for higher resistance values.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">So, there’s a trade-off here: the larger the resistors, the lower the current flow, which reduces power consumption when the MOSFET is in the on state. But a larger resistor also reduces the amount of current available at the drain, thus increasing the amount of time it takes to switch a MOSFET connected to the drain. We’re left with a dilemma: small pull-up and pull-down resistors increase power consumption, but large resistors slow down the computer.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch05lev2sec5"><em><strong>CMOS Switch</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">We can solve this dilemma with <em>complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)</em> technology. To see how this works, let’s eliminate the pull-up and pull-down resistors and connect the drains of a P-channel and an N-channel. The P-channel will replace the pull-up resistor in the N-channel circuit, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_101"/>the N-channel will replace the pull-down resistor in the P-channel circuit. We’ll also connect the two gates, giving the circuit shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig14">Figure 5-14</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch5fig14" src="../images/pg129_Image_158.jpg" alt="Image" width="241" height="216"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 5-14: A CMOS inverter (NOT) circuit</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig15">Figure 5-15</a>(a) shows the equivalent circuit with the gates at the higher power supply voltage of 5 V. The pull-up MOSFET (a P-channel) is off and the pull-down MOSFET (an N-channel) is on, so the drains are pulled down to the lower power supply voltage of 0 V. In <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig15">Figure 5-15</a>(b), the gates are at the lower power supply voltage of 0 V, which turns the P-channel MOSFET on and the N-channel MOSFET off. The P-channel MOSFET pulls the drains up to the higher power supply voltage of 5 V.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">The two main advantages of using CMOS circuits are:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li class="noindent">They consume very little power. Because of the switching speed difference between N-channel and P-channel MOSFETs, only a small amount of current flows during the switching period. Less current means less heat, which is often the limiting factor in chip design.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">The circuit responds much faster. A MOSFET can supply the current at its output faster than a resistor can, charging the gate of the following MOSFET. This allows us to build faster computers.</li>&#13;

<p class="indent">From the truth table, we see that the signal at point A is ¬(<em>x</em> ∧ <em>y</em>). The circuit from point A to the output is a NOT gate. The result at point A is called the <em>NAND</em> operation. It requires two fewer transistors than the AND operation. We’ll look at the implications of this in the next section.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec3"><strong>NAND and NOR Gates</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">As you learned in the previous section, the inherent design of transistors means that most circuits invert the signal. That is, for most circuits, a high voltage at the input produces a low voltage at the output, and vice versa. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_103"/>As a result, an AND gate will typically require a NOT gate at the output to achieve a true AND operation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You also learned that it takes fewer transistors to produce NOT(AND) than a regular AND. This combination is so common that it has been given a name: the <em>NAND gate</em>. And, of course, we have an equivalent with the OR gate, called the <em>NOR gate</em>:</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentin1a"><strong>NAND</strong>   A binary operator that gives a result of <code>0</code> if and only if <em>both</em> operands are <code>1</code> and gives <code>1</code> otherwise.

<p class="indent1">Although in the previous chapter we explicitly showed NOT gates when inputs to gates are complemented, it’s common to simply use these small circles at the input to signify the complement. For example, <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig19">Figure 5-19</a> shows an OR gate with both inputs complemented.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">As the truth table shows, this is another way to implement a NAND gate. As you learned in <a href="ch04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, De Morgan’s law confirms this:</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec4"><strong>NAND as a Universal Gate</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">One of the interesting properties about NAND gates is that they can be used to build AND, OR, and NOT gates. This means the NAND gate can be used to implement any Boolean function. In this sense, you can think of the NAND gate as a <em>universal gate</em>. Recalling De Morgan’s law, it probably won’t surprise you that a NOR gate can also be used as a universal gate. But the physics of CMOS transistors is such that NAND gates are faster and take up less space, so they are almost always the preferred solution.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s go through how to use a NAND gate to build an AND, OR, or NOT gate. To build a NOT gate using a NAND gate, simply connect the signal to both inputs of the NAND gate, as shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig20">Figure 5-20</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch5fig20" src="../images/pg132_Image_165.jpg" alt="Image" width="218" height="43"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 5-20: A NOT gate built from a NAND gate</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To make an AND gate, we can observe that the first NAND gate in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig21">Figure 5-21</a> produces ¬(<em>x</em> ∧ <em>y</em>) and connect it to a NOT gate like the one in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig20">Figure 5-20</a> to produce (<em>x</em> ∧ <em>y</em>).</p>&#13;

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 5-21: An AND gate built from two NAND gates</em></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">We can use De Morgan’s law to derive an OR gate. Consider the following:</p>&#13;
<div class="image1"><img src="../images/pg132_Image_167.jpg" alt="Image" width="260" height="68"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">So, to implement OR, we need three NAND gates, as in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig22">Figure 5-22</a>. The two NAND gates at the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> inputs are connected as NOT gates to produce ¬<em>x</em> and ¬<em>y</em>, which gives ¬(¬<em>x</em> ∧ ¬<em>y</em>) at the output of the third NAND gate.</p>&#13;

<div class="image1"><img src="../images/pg133_Image_169.jpg" alt="Image" width="249" height="21"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Without knowing how logic gates are constructed, it would be reasonable to implement this function with the circuit shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig23">Figure 5-23</a>.</p>&#13;

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 5-23:</em> F<em>(</em>w, x, y, z<em>) using two AND gates and one OR gate</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Although it might seem like we’re going in the wrong direction, let’s add some hardware to this circuit. The involution property states that ¬(¬<em>x</em>) = <em>x</em>, so we can add two NOT gates to each path, as shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig24">Figure 5-24</a>.</p>&#13;

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 5-24:</em> F<em>(</em>w, x, y, z<em>) using two AND gates, one OR gate, and four NOT gates</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Comparing the two AND gate/NOT gate combinations that operate on the <em>w</em>, <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em> inputs with <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig17">Figure 5-17</a>, we see that each is simply a NAND gate. They will produce ¬(<em>w</em> ∧ <em>x</em>) and ¬(<em>y</em> ∧ <em>z</em>) at the outputs of the two leftmost NOT gates.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You saw from the application of De Morgan’s law in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig19">Figure 5-19</a> that (¬<em>a</em>) ∨ (¬<em>b</em>) = ¬(<em>a</em> ∧ <em>b</em>). In other words, we can replace the combination of the two rightmost NOT gates and the OR gate with a single NAND gate:</p>&#13;
<div class="image1"><img src="../images/pg133_Image_172.jpg" alt="Image" width="370" height="27"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">The resulting circuit, shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig25">Figure 5-25</a>, uses three NAND gates.</p>&#13;

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 5-25:</em> F<em>(</em>w, x, y, z<em>) using three NAND gates</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">From simply viewing the logic circuit diagrams in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig23">Figures 5-23</a> and <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig25">5-25</a>, it may seem that we haven’t gained anything in this circuit transformation. But we saw in the previous section that a NAND gate (point A in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig16">Figure 5-16</a>) requires two fewer transistors than an AND gate. Thus, the NAND gate implementation is less power-intensive and faster. The same is true of an OR gate.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">The conversion from an AND/OR/NOT gate design to one that uses only NAND gates is straightforward:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Express the function as a minimal sum of products.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Convert the products (AND terms) and the final sum (OR) to NANDs.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Add a NAND gate for any product with only a single literal.</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p class="indent">Everything I’ve said about NAND gates here applies to NOR gates. You simply apply De Morgan’s law to find the complement of everything. But as mentioned previously, NAND gates are typically faster and take up less space than NOR gates, so they are almost always the preferred solution.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As with software, hardware design is an iterative process. Most problems do not have a unique solution, and you often need to develop several designs and analyze each one within the context of the available hardware. As the previous example shows, two solutions that look the same on paper may be very different at the hardware level.</p>&#13;

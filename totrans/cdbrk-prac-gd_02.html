</figure>
<p class="BodyContinued">The telegram depicted in <a href="#figure2-1" id="figureanchor2-1">Figure 2-1</a> (and provided to us by Karsten Hansky) was sent from St Leonards-on-Sea, United Kingdom, to Georgetown, British Guyana, in 1939.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c02-endnote-1" id="c02-noteref-1">1</a></sup> The message on this telegram is partially encrypted. In the following transcript, the ciphertext is printed in bold on the fourth line:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>CDE.</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>BRG9.IDCH. STLEONARDSONSEA. 10. 9th. 13.20.</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>ROBERTSON TREASURY GEORGETOWNBG.</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code class="bold">JKHQY GYULN QOOWE HAWNH EAOPL KODEX HAHQR.</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>10.25AM.</code></p>
<p>The encryption method used here, called the Caesar cipher, is quite simple, so it will serve as a good starting point for our discussion of encryption techniques. We dedicate this chapter to it.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502727c02-0001"><a class="XrefDestination" id="HowtheCaesarcipherworks"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727c02-003"/>How the Caesar cipher works</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The Caesar cipher shifts each letter of the alphabet by a certain number of characters. We can consider the cipher’s key to be a number that determines the shift offset.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_19" title="19"/>In the telegram shown in <a href="#figure2-1">Figure 2-1</a>, the key is 4, as visualized in the following table:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>Plaintext:  </code><code class="bold">ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>Ciphertext: EFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCD</code></p>
<p>Here’s a different way to represent this key. This diagram shows that <code class="bold">A</code> is replaced by <code>E</code>, <code class="bold">B</code> by <code>F</code>, <code class="bold">C</code> by <code>G</code>, <code class="bold">D</code> by <code>H</code>, and so on:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="103" src="image_fi/502727c02/g02002.png" width="694"/></figure>
<p>When we apply the key to the encrypted telegram line in reverse, we get the following plaintext: <code class="bold">NOLUC KCYPR USSAI LEARL IESTP OSHIB LELUV</code>. If we put the blanks in the right places, the message might then say, <code class="bold">NO LUCK CYPRUS SAIL EARLIEST POSHIBLE LUV</code>.</p>
<p>We still don’t know exactly what this message means. <code class="bold">POSHIBLE</code> is probably an incorrect spelling of <code class="bold">POSSIBLE</code>, while <code class="bold">CYPRUS</code> might refer to a ship of that name. <code class="bold">LUV</code> could be an acronym for the sender’s initials or simply an abbreviation for <code class="bold">LOVE</code>.</p>
<p>If we used the Caesar cipher with an alphabet of twenty-six letters, there would be twenty-five (useful) different keys. That’s because a shift of zero would not change the text, as every letter would shift to itself. A shift of twenty-six would do the same thing.</p>
<p>To apply a Caesar cipher, you can use a cipher disk or a cipher slide (see <a href="#figure2-2" id="figureanchor2-2">Figure 2-2</a>). A Caesar cipher with the key 13, also referred to as ROT-13, is a <em>self-inverting cipher</em>—if you use it twice, you get the plaintext again.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">If you want to check whether a certain cryptogram has been created with a Caesar cipher, counting the letters (i.e., performing a frequency analysis) is helpful. To see why this is the case, let’s first look at the letter frequencies in a typical English text:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="127" src="image_fi/502727c02/g02003.png" width="649"/></figure>
<p>We see that <code class="bold">E</code> is the most frequent letter, and that it is surrounded by much less frequent ones. <code class="bold">R</code>, <code class="bold">S</code>, and <code class="bold">T</code> are three frequent letters in a row. The last five letters, <code class="bold">V</code>, <code class="bold">W</code>, <code class="bold">X</code>, <code class="bold">Y</code>, and <code class="bold">Z</code>, are all quite rare. If we apply a Caesar cipher to an English text, we’ll notice the bars of this diagram move by a certain number of steps. For instance, if <code>K</code> is the letter with the highest bar, we should see it surrounded by far less frequent letters on each side, indicating that it corresponds to <code class="bold">E</code>. We can use this fact to detect a Caesar cipher.</p>
<p>Look now at the following two newspaper ads, which were both published in the London newspaper <em>The Times</em> in 1853:<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c02-endnote-2" id="c02-noteref-2">2</a></sup></p>

<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_21" title="21"/>We assume that both ads were encrypted the same way. <code class="bold">CENERENTOLA</code> (Italian for “Cinderella”) is probably the pseudonym of the sender or recipient. As it is not encrypted, we can omit it from our examinations.</p>
<p>A good way to proceed is to perform a frequency count of the two cryptograms combined. We could count the letters manually or use computer assistance, such as with CrypTool 2 or a web-based tool such as <a class="LinkURL" href="https://dcode.fr/en">https://dcode.fr/en</a>. Here is a chart we made ourselves:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="145" src="image_fi/502727c02/g02006.png" width="663"/></figure>
<p>We see in <a href="#figure2-3" id="figureanchor2-3">Figure 2-3</a> that <code>j</code> is the most frequently used letter and is surrounded by less frequent ones. The letters <code>w</code>, <code>x</code>, and <code>y</code> form a block of three consecutive letters of high frequency. <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, <code>d</code>, and <code>e</code> make up five letters of low frequency in a row.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="" class="" height="317" src="image_fi/502727c02/f02003.png" width="667"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure2-3">Figure 2-3</a>: Comparing the letter frequencies of the CENERENTOLA ads with the letter frequencies of the English language suggests that we are dealing with a Caesar cipher.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>All in all, the frequency analysis of our ciphertexts looks very similar to the frequencies of the English language, except that the bars are all shifted by five steps (<code class="bold">A</code> = <code>F</code>, <code class="bold">B</code> = <code>G</code>, <code class="bold">C</code> = <code>H</code> . . .). This suggests that we are dealing with a Caesar cipher. In fact, by applying this exact five-step shift, we can derive the following plaintexts:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>CENERENTOLA.—I wish to try if you can read this and am most anxious to hear that and, when you return, and how long you remain, here. Do write a few lines darling, please. I have been very far from happy since you went away.</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code> </code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_22" title="22"/><code>CENERENTOLA.—Until my heart is sick have i tried to frame an explanation for you, but cannot. Silence is safest if the true cause is not suspected: If it is, all stories will be siffted to the bottom. Do you remember our cousin’s first proposition: think of it.</code></p>
<p>Apparently, these two messages were written by a romantic couple. This is no surprise, as encrypted newspaper ads were a popular means of secret communication between lovers in Victorian England.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502727c02-0003"><a class="XrefDestination" id="HowtobreakaCaesarcipher"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727c02-005"/>How to break a Caesar cipher</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">As should have become clear, a Caesar cipher is easily broken once identified. If you know the ciphertext letter that stands for, say, <code class="bold">E</code>, you can easily figure out the key.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other ways to solve a Caesar cryptogram. We can try all possible keys, checking for a plaintext that makes sense. This approach is referred to as <em>brute-force</em> or <em>exhaustive key search</em>. As there are only twenty-five keys, a brute-force attack on a Caesar cipher isn’t too difficult. Let’s perform one on the following advertisement, published in the London <em>Standard</em> on May 26, 1888:<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c02-endnote-3" id="c02-noteref-3">3</a></sup></p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="125" src="image_fi/502727c02/g02007.png" width="629"/></figure>
<p>A frequency analysis of the ciphertext reveals that a Caesar cipher is very likely. To break it, let’s write the message’s first two words in the first row of a table, then fill in the table by shifting each letter by one in each subsequent row. When we reach <code>Z</code>, we’ll wrap back around to <code>A</code>. We recommend writing this table column-wise:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code class="bold"> 0 URNYGU ORGGRE</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code> 1 VSOZHV PSHHSF</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code> 2 WTPAIW QTIITG</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code> 3 XUQBJX RUJJUH</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code> 4 YVRCKY SVKKVI</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code> 5 ZWSDLZ TWLLWJ</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code> 6 AXTEMA UXMMXK</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code> 7 BYUFNB VYNNYL</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code> 8 CZVGOC WZOOZM</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code> 9 DAWHPD XAPPAN</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_23" title="23"/><code>10 EBXIQE YBQQBO</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>11 FCYYRF ZCRRCP</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>12 GDZKSG ADSSDQ</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>13 HEALTH BETTER</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>14 IFBMUI CFUUFS</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>. . .</code></p>
<p>It is immediately clear that line 13, <code>HEALTH BETTER</code>, is the correct one. This means the text used ROT-13. Usually, creating such a table for only one word is enough.</p>
<p>Brute-forcing becomes even easier if we use CrypTool 2 to perform the twenty-five Caesar decryptions. The CrypTool 2 template “Caesar Brute-Force Analysis” provides the functionality we need for this purpose. Let’s apply it to the following ciphertext taken from Elonka’s <em>The Mammoth Book of Secret Codes and Cryptograms</em>:<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c02-endnote-4" id="c02-noteref-4">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>Devhqfh vkdushqv oryh, suhvhqfh vwuhqjwkhqv lw. Ehqmdplq Iudqnolq</code></p>
<p>Here’s an excerpt from the twenty-five decryptions CrypTool 2 performs:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>1 Wxoajya odwnlajo hkra, lnaoajya opnajcpdajo ep. Xajfwiej Bnwjghej</code></p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Our colleague Gary Klivans, a retired police captain from New York State, is a prominent expert on encryption methods used by gangs and prison inmates.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c02-endnote-5" id="c02-noteref-5">5</a></sup> His fascinating 2016 book <em>Gang Secret Codes: Deciphered</em> is a must-read for everybody interested in codebreaking.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c02-endnote-6" id="c02-noteref-6">6</a></sup> As of 2023, Gary works as a forensics consultant specializing in gang codes. He is also a frequent writer and lecturer in the field of forensic codebreaking. Gary provided us with an undated encrypted message from a prison inmate, shown in <a href="#figure2-4" id="figureanchor2-4">Figure 2-4</a>.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#c02-endnote-7" id="c02-noteref-7">7</a></sup></p>

<figcaption><p><a id="figure2-4">Figure 2-4</a>: An encrypted message from a prison inmate. The plaintext proved quite interesting.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Every word in this message ends with <code>yp</code>. It was clear to Gary that these two-letter suffixes had no meaning and were included to confuse the codebreaker. Using frequency analysis (ignoring the <code>yp</code>’s), Gary saw that this cryptogram had most likely been created with a Caesar cipher. As <code>Z</code> is the most frequent letter, finding the solution was quite simple. Here’s the substitution table the prison inmate used (the key is 21):</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>Plaintext:  </code><code class="bold">ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>Ciphertext: VWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTU</code></p>
<p>Based on this table, the following plaintext can be retrieved:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>YOU'LL RECEIVE # MRR STRIPS MAKE SURE</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>THAT YOUR HANDS ARE COMPLETELY DRY BEFORE</code></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>YOU TOUCH THEM. DON’T RIP THEM AND MOST</code></p>

<p class="BodyCustom"><code>SANITIZER BEFORE YOU COME IN</code></p>
<p>This message proved quite interesting. A prison inmate seems to be explaining to the recipient (perhaps his wife) how to pack drugs (<code>MRR STRIPS</code>) into a condom and Saran Wrap (<code>SIR-RAN-WRAP</code>). He advises this person to hand him these drug packages during a visit so that he can immediately swallow them, smuggling the drugs into his prison cell.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">Brian Regan (not to be confused with the comedian of the same name) used to work as a master sergeant in the US Air Force. In 1999, he began trying to sell highly classified documents, videotapes, and storage media to foreign governments, hoping to receive over $10 million. In 2001, before he was able to succeed, he was arrested, convicted of espionage, and sentenced to life in prison.</p>
<p>Regan, who had been trained in cryptography, used several encryption methods to conceal banking codes, addresses, and other information. The FBI’s codebreaking unit, called the Cryptanalysis and Racketeering Records Unit (CRRU), was able to break most of Regan’s ciphertexts thanks to its master codebreaker, Dan Olson. The following was one of the easier ones:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="153" src="image_fi/502727c02/g02008.png" width="410"/></figure>
<p>As Olson found out (probably by brute force), this note is encrypted using a Caesar cipher with a key of 1. The numbers are shifted by one, too. We can easily decrypt the first two lines:</p>

<p>This message refers to the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), located in a building named Münzhof at Bahnhofstrasse 45 in Zurich, Switzerland. (Regan evidently used the codename <code class="bold">LL</code> for this bank.) The number <code class="bold">422230900832307</code> is a bank account number. Lines 3 and 4 are encrypted in the same way:</p>

- en: It’s hard to understand how a computer works without opening it and looking
    around inside. Likewise, it’s hard to understand how products are made without
    going into a factory and touring the line. Although we often think of manufacturing
    as the necessary but boring step after innovation, in reality, the two are tightly
    coupled. An inventor thinks about a product once; a factory thinks about the same
    product day in and day out, sometimes for years on end.

  zh: 很难理解一台计算机是如何工作的，除非你把它打开，看看里面的构造。同样，除非你进入工厂并参观生产线，否则很难理解产品是如何制造的。尽管我们常常认为制造是创新之后必要却枯燥的步骤，实际上，两者是紧密相连的。发明者只思考一次产品；而工厂每天都在思考同一个产品，有时长达数年之久。
- en: The importance of factories as an innovation node is only growing in today’s
    connected global economy. The reality is that there is no “Apple factory” or “Nike
    factory.” Rather, there is a series of facilities that are domain experts in processes
    (such as PCB fabrication or zipper manufacturing) that are curated by the familiar
    brands. Thus, it’s not uncommon to see two competitors’ products running side
    by side down similar lines in a single facility. This concentration of domain-specific
    expertise means that the best place to learn how to make an aspect of your product
    better is often the same place that makes a similar aspect in everybody else’s
    products.

    Chumby, ceased operations. I had decided to take a year off to figure things out
    and cross a few items off the bucket list, one of which was a trip to Italy. My
    girlfriend had the bright idea of reaching out to the Arduino team to see if I
    could visit their factory in Scarmagno (this was years before the Arduino/Genuino
    split) as part of our itinerary. Members of Officine Arduino (particularly managing
    director Davide Gomba) kindly took time out of their busy schedules to show me

    small holes that connect different layers of the PCB), mounting holes, plated
    slots, and so forth. When a PCB is manufactured, the holes are drilled before
    *patterning*, the stage where a masking chemical is photographically defined on
    the sheet everywhere the final boards need to have copper, including locations
    of traces, solder pads, and so on. Some of the drilled holes are used to align
    the masks that pattern the traces later in the process. Drilling is also a dirty
    and messy process that could damage circuit patterns if they were in place beforehand.

  zh: 处理PCB的第一步是钻孔——包括焊盘、通孔（连接PCB不同层的小孔）、安装孔、电镀槽等等。当制造PCB时，钻孔在*图案化*之前进行，图案化是通过掩膜化学物质在铜板上光学定义的阶段，这些化学物质确定了最终板上需要有铜的位置，包括走线、焊盘等。一些钻孔用于对齐掩膜，这些掩膜稍后会在工艺中对走线进行图案化。钻孔还是一个脏乱的过程，如果走线已经放置，可能会损坏电路图案。

- en: Note that the particular drill I saw at System Elettronica was relatively small.
    I’ve seen massive drill decks in China that gang (mechanically attach) four or
    six drill heads together in a truck-size machine, processing dozens of panels
    at the same time as opposed to the three panels this drill could handle. The reasoning
    behind this approach is that the precise, robotic positioning assembly is the
    expensive part of a drilling machine. The drill itself is cheap—just a spinning
    motor to drive the bit. So, one way to increase throughput is to gang several
    drills together on one large assembly and move them in concert. Each individual
    drill still goes through its own stack of panels, but for the price of one X-Y
    positioner, you get four to six times the throughput as the drill I saw on my
    trip to Italy. Those bigger machines drill so fast and hard that the ground shakes
    with every via drilled, even from several meters away.

  zh: 请注意，我在System Elettronica看到的这台特定钻孔机相对较小。我曾在中国见过巨大的钻孔机，它们将四到六个钻头机械连接在一起，组成一个卡车大小的机器，同时处理几十个面板，而这台钻孔机只能处理三个面板。这种做法的原因是，精确的机器人定位系统是钻孔机中最昂贵的部分，而钻头本身很便宜——只是一个旋转的电动机来驱动钻头。因此，一种提高生产效率的方法是将多个钻头组装在一个大型系统中，同时操作。每个钻头仍然会处理自己的一堆面板，但通过使用一个X-Y定位器，你可以达到我在意大利旅行中看到的钻孔机的四到六倍产能。那些更大的机器钻孔速度快且力量大，甚至在几米外都能感觉到每个孔的振动。

- en: I’m glad I made the side trip to visit the Arduino PCB factory. I’ve visited
    several PCB factories, and every one has a different character and its own set
    of tricks to improve yield, as well as unique limitations that designers need
    to compensate for. It was also interesting to see the little trick about using
    an extra layer of soldermask instead of silkscreen for achieving high cosmetic
    quality. While the resolution of a silkscreen is limited by the mesh of the silk
    barrier to hold the paint, soldermask is limited by the quality of the optics
    and chemical developing, giving over an order of magnitude improvement in resolution
    and ultimately a higher perceived quality. Normally the lower quality of silkscreen
    is acceptable because end users don’t see the circuit boards inside computers,
    but for Arduino, the end product *is* the circuit board.

    to sliders for a couple of minutes, would be quite content to suffer a tiny bump
    on the tip of their zipper to save another human the fate of manually aligning
    pullers into sliders for eight hours a day. Alternatively, I suppose an engineer
    could spend countless hours trying to design a more complex method for aligning
    the pullers and sliders, but there are two problems with that:'

  zh: 我想象，大多数人在看到一个人花几分钟将拉链拉头与拉链滑块连接在一起后，应该会很乐意忍受拉链尖端的小小凸起，以节省另一位工人每天下八小时手动将拉头对准滑块的命运。或者，我想工程师可能会花费无数小时，试图设计一种更复杂的方法来对准拉头和滑块，但这有两个问题：

- en: This zipper factory owner had already automated everything else in the facility,
    so I figure they’ve thought long and hard about this problem, too. My guess is
    that robots are expensive to build and maintain; people are self-replicating and
    largely self-maintaining. Remember that third input to the factory—rice? Any robot’s
    spare parts have to be cheaper than rice for the robot to earn a place on this
    factory’s floor.

  zh: 这家拉链工厂的老板已经将工厂的其他部分都实现了自动化，所以我猜他们也考虑了这个问题。我猜测机器人建造和维护的成本非常高，而人类是自我复制和大部分自我维持的。还记得工厂的第三个输入——大米吗？任何机器人的备件必须比大米便宜，才能使机器人在这个工厂中占有一席之地。
- en: In reality, however, it’s too much effort to explain this concept to end customers;
    in fact, quite the opposite happens in the market. Putting the smooth zippers
    together involves extra labor, so the zippers cost more; therefore, they tend
    to end up in high-end products. This further enforces the notion that really smooth
    zippers with no tiny tab on them must be the result of quality control and attention
    to detail.

  zh: 然而，实际上，将这个概念解释给最终客户听是非常费力的；事实上，市场上正好相反。将光滑拉链装配在一起需要额外的人工，因此拉链的成本更高；因此，它们往往出现在高端产品中。这进一步强化了这样一种观念：没有小标签的非常光滑的拉链一定是质量控制和注重细节的结果。
- en: My world is full of small frustrations like this. For example, most customers
    perceive plastics with a mirror finish to be of a higher quality than those with
    a satin finish. There is no functional difference between the two plastics’ structural
    performance, but making something with a mirror finish takes a lot more effort.
    The injection-molding tools must be painstakingly and meticulously polished, and
    at every step in the factory, workers must wear white gloves. Mountains of plastic
    are scrapped for hairline defects, and extra films of plastic are placed over
    mirror surfaces to protect them during shipping.

  zh: 我的世界充满了这样的微小挫败感。例如，大多数顾客认为镜面处理的塑料比缎面处理的塑料质量更高。其实这两种塑料的结构性能没有功能性的区别，但制作镜面效果的过程要费很多功夫。注塑工具必须仔细地打磨抛光，在工厂的每一步，工人们都必须戴上白手套。为了一丝不苟的质量，很多塑料都被浪费掉，且在运输过程中，为了保护镜面，额外的塑料膜会覆盖在镜面表面上。
- en: For all that effort, for all that waste, what’s the first thing users do? They
    put their dirty fingerprints all over the mirror finish. Within a minute of a
    product coming out of the box, all that effort is undone. Or worse yet, the user
    leaves the protective film on, resulting in a net worse cosmetic effect than a
    satin finish.

  zh: 为了所有这些努力，为了所有这些浪费，用户做的第一件事是什么？他们把脏手指印弄到镜面处理的表面上。产品从包装盒出来一分钟内，所有的努力都被摧毁了。或者更糟糕的是，用户把保护膜留在了上面，结果反而产生了比缎面效果更糟的外观效果。
- en: Contrast this to satin-finished plastic. Satin finishes don’t require protective
    films, are easier for workers and users to handle, last longer, and have much
    better yields. In the user’s hands, they hide small scratches, fingerprints, and
    bits of dust. Arguably, the satin finish offers a better long-term customer experience
    than the mirror finish.

  zh: 将其与缎面处理的塑料进行对比。缎面处理不需要保护膜，更容易让工人和用户操作，使用寿命更长，而且产量更高。在用户手中，它能遮掩小划痕、指纹和灰尘。可以说，缎面效果在长远的客户体验上，比镜面效果更好。

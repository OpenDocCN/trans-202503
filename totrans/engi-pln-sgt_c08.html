<h2 id="h1-502321c08-0001">Introduction</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">All infrastructure has one thing in common: it must be built. You can’t buy a sewer system or electrical grid off the shelf at a store. Rather, these complex facilities are constructed in place by humans and machines. Construction can be both a nuisance and a joy, depending on your perspective (or your commute). It often seems noisy, disruptive, and slow. However, the giant-sized equipment and the urgency of effort evoke a sense of wonder and awe in the attentive observer. There is nothing quite like witnessing a structure take shape from raw materials and hard work, and it’s often difficult to walk past any construction site without being distracted by the continual commotion.</p>
<p>Although construction can seem chaotic, there is a method to the madness. Each separate worker and piece of equipment has a specific task. The individual accomplishments may seem insignificant or even mundane, but they slowly accumulate into results that can be spectacular (as shown in the previous chapters). Observing construction sites can be a one-time activity of spotting machines and equipment or a regular routine to marvel at the steady progress. No matter how you choose to watch, you can always see something interesting on a construction site.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c08-0002"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_201" title="201"/>Typical Construction Site</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Whether it’s a road, bridge, dam, pipeline, or any other piece of infrastructure being built, a construction site may look like a disorganized frenzy of machines and activity at first glance. However, look closely, and you’ll begin to understand the rhythm. Although every construction job is unique, the site where the work takes place is often remarkably similar from project to project.</p>
<p>Before construction can begin, a surveyor must lay out the location of the project on the ground. Surveyors install <span class="SmallCaps">control points</span> away from the area of disturbance that can be used as a reference once construction begins. They are usually large nails driven into the underlying concrete or asphalt or iron rods driven into the soil. Surveyors often mark control points and other essential features of construction with wooden <span class="SmallCaps">stakes </span>and plastic flagging tape. Linear construction projects like roadways and pipelines often use a coordinate system called <em>stationing</em>. In the United States, each station is equal to 100 feet. It’s common to see locations on a site labeled with their distance along the centerline of the structure in stations plus the number of feet (for example, “STA 12+50” indicates a location 1,250 feet along the axis).</p>
<p>In addition to surveying, all subsurface utilities must be identified and marked to ensure that excavators don’t inadvertently damage underground lines. Locators use colored spray paint to create <span class="SmallCaps">utility location marks</span> on the ground. In many parts of the world, these colors are standardized. For example, red is used for electric lines, orange for telecommunications, yellow for natural gas, green for sewers, and blue for drinking water lines. White paint is used to show the location of any excavations that will take place during construction, and pink is reserved for survey markings.</p>
<p>The first thing you might notice on a site is the <span class="SmallCaps">project sign</span>, which is used to identify the companies involved, notify the public of the name and purpose of the project, and post important information such as building permits. </p>
<p>Besides the structure itself, much of a construction site is usually dedicated to moving and storing materials. Heavy equipment and large trucks need space to move, load, and unload supplies. Having these large vehicles drive directly on the ground typically ends in a muddy mess, especially after rain. Therefore, contractors often construct <span class="SmallCaps">temporary roads</span> on the site to keep construction traffic flowing. In addition, most sites include a <span class="SmallCaps">staging area</span> for offloading and storing equipment and supplies to be used later in the project.</p>
<p>Although at a glance it might look like construction involves a lot of standing around, anyone who has worked in the trades can tell you that it’s challenging work. Most of the people on a construction site are tradespeople who perform skilled labor such as masons, carpenters, welders, painters, and ironworkers. In addition, you may see a <em>superintendent</em> who oversees the project, an <em>inspector</em> who ensures that construction <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_202" title="202"/>is performed according to the project plans and specifications, and safety personnel who act as spotters for potential accidents and resolve any hazards before they can result in injury.</p>
<p>Construction sites are particularly hazardous because of the large vehicles, the dangerous tools, and the need to work in precarious locations and heights. Many of the elements you can observe on a site are related to worker safety, including the <em>personal protective equipment</em> worn by each individual. Workers and other staff on site are usually required to wear a <span class="SmallCaps">hard hat</span> to protect against falling or protruding objects. Workers also wear <span class="SmallCaps">high-visibility clothing</span> featuring bright colors and reflective stripes to prevent accidents that result from not being seen. When working at heights, <span class="SmallCaps">scaffolding</span> is used to provide temporary platforms for crews to access challenging areas. Workers may wear <span class="SmallCaps">fall protection equipment</span>, including a harness and tether, to reduce the danger of falling while working at heights or near deep excavations.</p>
<p>In addition to keeping workers safe, construction projects must consider the safety of the public as well.  Most sites will include a <span class="SmallCaps">fence</span> to keep wayward pedestrians out of hazardous areas, sometimes fitted with a screen to keep the wind from blowing dust and discourage theft by hiding expensive tools and equipment. </p>
<p>Public safety is essential for roadway projects, which often require the closure of traffic lanes or a detour around the site. Contractors install traffic <span class="SmallCaps">cones</span>, <span class="SmallCaps">barrels</span>, <span class="SmallCaps">barriers</span>, and <span class="SmallCaps">barricades</span> to redirect vehicles and keep them away from construction activities. <span class="SmallCaps">Warning signs</span> and barriers are always orange so that drivers can distinguish them easily from other signs to proceed with caution through the work zone.</p>
<p>Construction doesn’t only involve hard labor and power tools. Like any other business, much of the work happens in an office, such as ordering materials, reviewing plans, holding meetings, and answering email. On large projects, contractors often have an entire workforce of office staff on site to support the construction and keep things running smoothly. You may see one or more trailers that serve as temporary <span class="SmallCaps">construction offices</span> for the contractor, site engineer, or owner to use when needed. Other trailers may be used for the <span class="SmallCaps">storage</span> of tools and materials.</p>
<p>One nuisance created by construction occurs from disturbance of the ground. Rain can easily wash away unprotected soil. These suspended sediments are considered pollutants because they degrade the quality of natural water bodies and impact wildlife habitat. So, most construction projects are required to have facilities that control stormwater runoff and keep it from carrying soil off the site. <span class="SmallCaps">Silt fences</span> and <span class="SmallCaps">filter socks</span> slow down runoff so the sediment can drop out of suspension. <span class="SmallCaps">Stabilized entrances</span> use rocks to knock the mud off the vehicles’ tires before they leave the site. Finally, <span class="SmallCaps">check dams</span> are placed in channels to keep flows from concentrating, which reduces the potential for erosion.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Many types of infrastructure, including wharves, bridges, and dams, are founded below the water. Constructing foundations where humans and machines cannot efficiently work is a significant challenge. As a result, much of underwater construction involves getting rid of the water first so that work can proceed in the dry, a process called <em>dewatering</em>. Often, a structure called a <em>cofferdam</em> is required to hold water back from a construction site temporarily. Cofferdams usually consist of earthen or rockfill embankments, interlocking steel plates called <em>sheet piles</em>, steel frames with a plastic membrane, or water-filled rubber bladders. They aren’t always completely watertight, so construction sites with cofferdams require pumps to keep the area dry. After construction is complete, the cofferdam is removed, flooding the site back to its original underwater state. For construction sites on rivers and canals, the dewatering process also requires flows to bypass the work. Depending on the volume, these bypasses may be handled by pumps, temporary channels, or tunnels, or by constructing a project in multiple phases while routing flows through the inactive part of the site.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c08-0003"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_205" title="205"/>Cranes</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">All construction can be boiled down to material handling: receiving deliveries, and storing, moving, and placing all the pieces and parts of a project. Of course, sweat and muscles can handle much of this work, but anyone working in the trades will tell you that there are plenty of jobs only a crane can accomplish. At many job sites, the question is not whether a crane will be used, but how many and what types. These backbones of the construction industry make it possible to lift and install materials and components much, much larger and heavier than would otherwise be possible with only human labor, making construction faster and more efficient than ever before.</p>
<p>Many types of cranes are used on construction sites, and each has its own benefits. They are usually divided into two types: <em>mobile</em> and <em>fixed cranes</em>. Mobile cranes have wheels or tracks, allowing them to move to different parts of a site. A <span class="SmallCaps">crawler crane</span> is mounted on an undercarriage with a set of <span class="SmallCaps">tracks</span>. Crawler cranes are the largest and most capable type of mobile cranes found on a construction site. They are often equipped with steel <span class="SmallCaps">booms</span> that can reach long distances and great heights. The largest booms are made from a lattice of steel bars to be both lightweight and extremely stiff. In addition, many manufacturers offer <span class="SmallCaps">jibs</span> that can be attached to the end of a boom to extend its reach even farther. Crawler cranes aren’t legal to drive on roadways, so they are usually trucked to a project to be assembled on site.</p>
<p>Like crawler cranes, <span class="SmallCaps">rough terrain cranes</span> ride atop a mobile undercarriage, but they use rubber tires instead of tracks. Rough terrain cranes are best at accessing remote and challenging locations. They are usually smaller than crawler cranes, making them faster to set up and easier to fit into spaces that other cranes could not. Many rough terrain cranes feature <span class="SmallCaps">telescoping booms</span> with sections that extend outward to increase the crane’s reach. They can be driven (slowly) while carrying a load, making it possible to move heavy objects across long distances on a construction site. However, their load rating increases significantly when operating in a fixed location on <span class="SmallCaps">outriggers</span>. These devices stabilize the crane by lifting the undercarriage off the pliable tires. <em>All-terrain cranes</em> work and look similar to rough terrain cranes, but they are designed to drive on streets and highways, eliminating the need to be hauled to a job site on a truck. They are usually the smallest of the mobile cranes but also the most versatile.</p>
<p>Fixed cranes are installed in a single location where they remain for some or all of a project’s duration. On a construction site, the most common type of fixed crane is the <span class="SmallCaps">tower crane</span>. It consists of a vertical <span class="SmallCaps">mast</span> and a horizontal <span class="SmallCaps">jib</span> extending out from the tower. The jib can rotate in any direction around the mast on a <span class="SmallCaps">turntable.</span> A <span class="SmallCaps">trolley</span> that rides along the jib allows the operator in the overhead <span class="SmallCaps">cab</span> to place the <span class="SmallCaps">hook</span> wherever needed.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_206" title="206"/>Installation of a tower crane is a feat on its own, so they usually are used only for projects with extended durations, like tall buildings. They often have a base of reinforced concrete and require another crane for assembly and disassembly. Some tower cranes can raise themselves, allowing the mast to increase in height as a building is built up from the ground. A <span class="SmallCaps">climbing frame</span> secures two sections of the mast as they are disconnected, lifting the upper part of the crane. Next, the crane raises and inserts a new mast section into the opening the climbing frame creates, where it is bolted into place. This process can be repeated as many times as needed to reach the desired height.</p>
<p>The primary goal of any crane is to relocate or reposition a load from one place to another, so cranes have many ways to move. Nearly all cranes have a drum onto which cabling is spooled. When a crane rotates the drum to lift a load using the cable, it is called <span class="SmallCaps">hoisting</span>. In addition to hoisting, some booms can pivot, allowing the crane to change the boom angle with cables or hydraulic cylinders. When the boom of a crane pivots up with a load, it is called <span class="SmallCaps">luffing</span>. Some cranes can luff the boom and jib separately, providing an even greater range of movement. Swinging the boom or jib horizontally is often called <span class="SmallCaps">slewing</span>. Finally, cranes with telescoping booms can <span class="SmallCaps">extend</span> or <span class="SmallCaps">retract</span>, and tower crane trolleys can <span class="SmallCaps">travel</span> inward or outward.</p>
<p>Spotters on the ground communicate to the crane operator which movements are needed to attach, secure, lift, and place a load. If radios are not available, standardized hand signals let the operator know which type of movement the crew needs. Ground crews also use <span class="SmallCaps">tag lines</span> when necessary to control the load and keep it from spinning.</p>
<p>As vital as they are to construction sites, cranes can also be dangerous. Lots of engineering is used to keep them from tipping over. Wooden pads called <span class="SmallCaps">crane mats</span> are often used to distribute the extreme pressure of cranes and keep them from sinking into the ground. <span class="SmallCaps">Counterweights</span> made from steel or concrete are used to balance the load on the hook, reducing the crane’s tendency to tip over (called its <em>moment</em>). Finally, on windy days, mobile cranes are generally taken down, and tower crane brakes are released so that the jibs can <em>weathervane</em>, allowing them to rotate freely with the wind rather than fight against it.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Most cranes use a hook to connect to the load, yet few things that need to be lifted have an attachment that fits nicely over a gigantic steel hook. <em>Rigging</em> is the term used to describe all the steps we go through to attach a load to a crane so it can be suspended and moved. A rigger’s most commonly used tool is a <em>sling</em>: a simple length of cable, chain, rope, or webbing with eyes or hooks on either end. Slings are generally used in one of three basic <em>hitches</em>. In a vertical hitch, one eye of the sling is connected to the hook, and the other is connected to an attachment point on the load. In a basket hitch, the sling passes under the load with both eyes on the hook. Finally, in a choker hitch, one eye of the sling is wrapped around the load, passed through the other eye, and attached to the hook. Each hitch used in rigging comes with a different load rating and specific advantages over the alternatives. Next time you watch a crane lifting a load, see if you can spot which of the three hitches is being used with the slings.</p>

<h2 id="h1-502321c08-0004"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_209" title="209"/>Construction Machines</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Nothing amplifies human effort more than heavy equipment. In addition to the cranes described in the previous section, a myriad of machines is used on construction sites to increase the speed and efficiency of work. Although construction machines may seem like just a cacophony of hammering and backup alarms, modern buildings and infrastructure could not exist without their capabilities to move, compact, dump, drill, deliver, break down, and build. Of course, describing every piece of equipment one might observe on a construction site would be impossible, but you’re bound to the ones described here if you keep an eye out.</p>
<p>A large number of construction machines are meant for performing earthwork: moving and placing soil and rock. <span class="SmallCaps">Excavators</span> can be found on many construction sites because of their versatility. They typically feature a <span class="SmallCaps">bucket</span>, <span class="SmallCaps">arm</span>, and rotating <span class="SmallCaps">cab</span>, although many other attachments and configurations exist. Excavators use their hydraulic cylinders to perform various functions, including digging holes and trenches, removing debris, and even lifting and placing loads like a crane. They come in many different sizes, from mini excavators that can fit in the back of a pickup truck to gigantic machines too large to be transported on a highway in one piece. <span class="SmallCaps">Trenchers</span> are another type of machine meant specifically for excavation. Trenchers use a toothed wheel or chain to cut long holes into the earth for installing pipelines, drains, electrical lines, and other linear utilities.</p>
<p><span class="SmallCaps">Dozers</span> feature large blades used to shove materials around. They can clear brush, trees, and boulders from a site, push soil across short distances, and spread fill over a large area. Like dozers, <span class="SmallCaps">graders</span> also feature a long blade. However, graders offer more precision, allowing operators to level (or <em>grade</em>) the earth with high accuracy. Instead of a blade, <span class="SmallCaps">loaders</span> are equipped with large buckets for excavating and transporting larger quantities of soil. These machines also come in many sizes, from the tiny <span class="SmallCaps">skid-steer</span> loaders used on small sites to the massive wheel loaders used in mines. When significant volumes of soil must be moved across a site, <span class="SmallCaps">scrapers</span> are the machine for the job. Scrapers cut into the earth like a carpenter’s plane, filling a hopper on the vehicle. Then the soil can be transported and placed directly from the scraper, eliminating the need to transfer it to another vehicle like a dump truck.</p>
<p>Many construction machines are dedicated exclusively to performing roadwork. <span class="SmallCaps">Paving machines</span> are used to lay asphalt on roads, bridges, and parking lots and create concrete curbs, gutters, barriers, and highways. Dump trucks or loaders feed asphalt or concrete into the machine, which uses a series of mechanical devices to create a smooth and even layer as it travels. Pavers that make concrete structures use a process called <em>slipforming</em> to create continuous shapes like curbs and highway barriers. Because the subgrade isn’t always perfectly level, many paving and slipform machines <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_210" title="210"/>use a <span class="SmallCaps">wand</span> that rides along a <span class="SmallCaps">stringline</span> set by surveyors according to the engineered alignment of the roadway. The wand controls the steering and position of the paving machine to ensure that the road and its other features are smooth and consistent.</p>
<p>Concrete structures cure and harden on their own, but earthen materials and asphalt pavement must be compacted into place. On large projects, this task is typically accomplished using a <span class="SmallCaps">roller compactor</span>, a heavy vehicle with one or two <span class="SmallCaps">smooth drums</span> that compress the soil or asphalt as they roll over it. Some roller compactors are equipped with <span class="SmallCaps">rubber tires</span> that help knead the subgrade or asphalt, speeding the compaction processes. Similarly, compactors used on sticky clay soils sometimes use a textured roller called a <span class="SmallCaps">sheepsfoot drum</span>. Finally, many roller compactors can vibrate, increasing their ability to smooth and flatten the surface.</p>
<p>Piles are another common part of many construction projects that consist of vertical structural elements drilled or driven into the ground to create retaining walls and foundations. <span class="SmallCaps">Pile drivers</span> use large <span class="SmallCaps">hammers</span> or vibratory mechanisms to push steel or concrete piles into the subsurface. Where piles are installed in holes, a <span class="SmallCaps">drill rig</span> is used to excavate shafts using an <span class="SmallCaps">auger</span> or other rotating tool.</p>
<p>Many construction projects involve casting wet concrete into forms on site. You may have seen a <span class="SmallCaps">concrete mixer truck</span> transporting concrete from a plant to a project site. The large drum has a spiral-shaped blade inside. When the drum rotates in one direction, it mixes concrete ingredients to keep them from separating during transit. When the drum rotates in the other direction, concrete is pushed toward the back of the drum to be discharged. Some projects can use concrete directly from a truck, but often concrete is needed in locations that are difficult to access. Therefore, mixer trucks often discharge into <span class="SmallCaps">concrete pumps</span> that can transport the wet mix through pipes. Some concrete pumps are also equipped with an articulating overhead <span class="SmallCaps">boom</span>, allowing concrete to be placed wherever needed with high accuracy.</p>
<p>Another class of construction machines called <em>aerial lifts</em> has the simple goal of safely positioning workers in precarious locations. A <span class="SmallCaps">scissor lift</span> consists of a mobile base driven by an operator and a platform that rises vertically atop crisscrossing braces. They move only vertically, so scissor lifts can’t be used to maneuver workers around obstacles. A <span class="SmallCaps">boom lift</span> uses a hydraulic arm to support the platform, offering more freedom to access difficult areas on a construction site.</p>
<p>Of course, in addition to the many vehicles used on construction sites, workers also use a litany of powered hand tools. Some of the most important construction tools are <em>pneumatic</em> (in other words, powered by air), necessitating an <span class="SmallCaps">air compressor</span> on site. It is common to spot trailer-mounted air compressors on construction projects used to power <span class="SmallCaps">jackhammers</span>, drills, grinders, nail guns, and many other tools workers use.</p>

<p class="BoxBodyFirst">The capabilities of construction equipment are rapidly increasing with newer and more advanced technologies. One innovation that has completely changed the world of earthwork is the Global Positioning System (GPS). There isn’t much need for map navigation on a construction site, but GPS technology offers many applications beyond the way we normally use it in our cars. GPS devices know where a machine is located on the site and the position of its tool in relation to the <em>final grade</em> (the desired elevation of the ground). Traditional projects require surveyors to meticulously stake out the locations and extents of earthwork, sometimes multiple times throughout a job. GPS-enabled equipment uses a digital model of the project and an onboard interface to show the operator exactly where to guide the machine. In some cases, the GPS device can even control the blade or bucket automatically. Many systems have multiple circular antennas mounted to the machine, so it’s easy to notice if the equipment is taking advantage of GPS.</p>

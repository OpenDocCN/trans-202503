- en: Since the release of the BBC micro:bit in 2016, millions of these devices have
    been distributed. They’re enjoyed by both kids and adults all over the world.
    The micro:bit was designed as an easy way to teach kids programming skills. One
    of its great advantages is that you don’t need anything more than a USB cable
    and a computer to start using it. Also, once programmed, it can be disconnected
    from a power source and run on batteries.

- en: The micro:bit has a small LED display as well as sensors for light, movement,
    and magnetic fields, so it has everything you need to make interesting projects.
    When you’re ready, you can easily connect things like motors, sensors, and loudspeakers
    using alligator clips—there’s no need for soldering. In other words, your micro:bit
    can be the *brain* for lots of projects and inventions.

- en: In these pages, you’ll find a variety of experiments and projects. The experiments
    show you how things work, and then in the projects, you’ll use that knowledge
    to make something funky.

- en: The book is divided into 10 chapters. [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml#ch01) tells you
    all you need to know about connecting and using your micro:bit. You’ll use this
    information in all the experiments and projects in this book. Each of the following
    chapters deals with a specific topic, such as light, sound, and movement. There
    are lots of fun and useful things you can do with your micro:bit!

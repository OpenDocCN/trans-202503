    CIRCUIT IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF CURRENT PASSING THROUGH THE CIRCUIT.
    YOU’LL USE THEM AT VARIOUS POINTS IN THIS BOOK FOR A VARIETY OF TASKS, FROM ENSURING
    A SAFE CURRENT FOR AN LED TO CREATING A VOLTAGE DIVIDER CIRCUIT.

- en: The exact resistance value of a resistor is measured in *ohms* (Ω). If you don’t
    already know the value of your resistor, you can determine it using its colored
    bands. This table shows which value correlates to each color.

- en: '*If you’re color-blind like me, determining a resistor’s value from its colored
    bands is almost impossible. I’d recommend keeping your resistors in organized
    and labeled bags so you can quickly and easily identify their value. If you’re
    faced with an unknown resistor, you can use the resistance setting on your multimeter,
    to help you. Simply connect the two probes of your multi­meter to either side
    of your resistor, and it will display its exact resistance.*'

- en: A standard resistor has four colored bands. The first two bands represent the
    first two digits of the resistor’s value. The third band is a multiplier that
    represents the number of zeros after the first two digits. The fourth band is
    the tolerance of the resistance; unless you’re doing specialized and precise work,
    you most likely won’t need to worry about the final band.

- en: The first band is green, so its value is 5\. The second band is blue, so its
    value is 6\. The third band is yellow, which corresponds to four 0s. The fourth
    band is gold, meaning the tolerance is +/–5 percent.

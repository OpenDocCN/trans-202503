    sorry to say we’re behind schedule. Our lighthouse isn’t finished. We’ve been
    working double-time, day and night.”

- en: Dozens of Green-Shelled Round machines were busy all around the enormous structure.
    They looked just like Tinker’s turtle, but they were the size of a large truck.
    Instead of drawing dots on paper, these turtles were laying bricks on top of bricks,
    making WALLs, STAIRs, and WINDOWs right before Laurie’s eyes.

    a forest of supports and buttresses on one side of the tower.

    south wall was falling outward. So we had to shore it up. Then it started falling
    *inward*.”

    scene that bothered Laurie, but she couldn’t put her finger on it. It looked .

    But we can fix any problem with more power and hard work!”

    of envy. The things she could do with all those turtles! “How do you teach the
    turtles to build a tower?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Here, let me show you.” Bruto led her to a tent nearby. A small army of people
    was working around a table. “First we write the plans on paper.”

    Bruto said. “Writing the plans wasn’t the worst part, though. We’re running out

  prefs: []

    Bruto said. “Take a look at this!” Off to the side was a table covered with tiny
    turtles and tiny bricks.

    were following the same plan as their bigger cousins.

    falling down.”

    pile of bricks. Bruto stood still for a long time, watching the dust settle as
    the turtles got to work cleaning up the mess.

  prefs: []

    right, everyone,” Bruto said to no one in particular. “Clear the decks! Empty
    your minds! Brainstorm! I want new ideas!”

    something she didn’t. They were professionals, after all. “I . . . I think it

    plan was a hollow square, twice as big, and it also fell down. Your plan is a
    hollow circle.”
  prefs: []

  prefs: []

    inside*!” said Bruto. “We need to fill up the insides with brick, too. It’s only
    logical.”

    he said, looking at the pile, “we’re going to build a pyramid.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

    one of the perfect solids!”

    my apologies, girlie, and tell her that we need more time to get it right.”

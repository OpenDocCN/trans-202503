<p class="noindent">This book introduces you to the vast world of <em>ethical hacking</em>, or the process of responsibly discovering security vulnerabilities and reporting them to the application owner. When I first started learning about hacking, I wanted to know not just <em>what</em> vulnerabilities hackers found but <em>how</em> they found them.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I searched for information but was always left with the same questions:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li class="noindent">What vulnerabilities are hackers finding in applications?</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">How did hackers learn about those vulnerabilities found in applications?</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">How do hackers begin infiltrating a site?</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">What does hacking look like? Is it all automated, or is it done manually?</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">How can I get started hacking and finding vulnerabilities?</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxii"/>I eventually landed on HackerOne, a bug bounty platform designed to connect ethical hackers with companies looking for hackers to test their applications. HackerOne includes functionality that allows hackers and companies to disclose bugs that have been found and fixed.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">While reading through those disclosed HackerOne reports, I struggled to understand what vulnerabilities people were finding and how they could be abused. I often had to reread the same report two or three times to understand it. I realized that I, and other beginners, could benefit from plain-language explanations of real-world vulnerabilities.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>Real-World Bug Hunting</em> is an authoritative reference that will help you understand different types of web vulnerabilities. You’ll learn how to find vulnerabilities, how to report them, how to get paid for doing so, and, occasionally, how to write defensive code. But this book doesn’t just cover successful examples: it also includes mistakes and lessons learned, many of them my own.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">By the time you finish reading, you’ll have taken your first step toward making the web a safer place, and you should be able to earn some money doing it.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="introlev1sec1"><strong>Who Should Read This Book</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This book is written with beginner hackers in mind. It doesn’t matter if you’re a web developer, a web designer, a stay-at-home parent, a 10-year-old kid, or a 75-year-old retiree.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">That said, although it’s not a prerequisite for hacking, some programming experience and a familiarity with web technologies can help. For example, you don’t have to be a web developer to be a hacker, but understanding the basic hypertext markup language (HTML) structure of a web page, how Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) define its look, and how JavaScript dynamically interacts with websites will help you discover vulnerabilities and recognize the impact of the bugs you find.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Knowing how to program is helpful when you’re looking for vulnerabilities involving an application’s logic and brainstorming how a developer might make mistakes. If you can put yourself in the programmer’s shoes, guess how they’ve implemented something, or read their code (if available), you’ll have a higher chance of success.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you want to learn about programming, No Starch Press has plenty of books to help you. You could also check out the free courses on Udacity and Coursera. <a href="app02.xhtml#app02">Appendix B</a> lists additional resources.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="introlev1sec2"><strong>How to Read This Book</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Each chapter that describes a vulnerability type has the following structure:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li class="noindent">A description of the vulnerability type</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Examples of the vulnerability type</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">A summary that provides conclusions</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxiii"/>Each vulnerability example includes the following:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li class="noindent">My estimation of how difficult it is to find and prove the vulnerability</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">The URL associated with the location in which the vulnerability was found</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">A link to the original disclosure report or write-up</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">The date the vulnerability was reported</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">The amount the reporter earned for submitting the information</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">A clear description of the vulnerability</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Takeaways that you can apply to your own hacking</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="indent">You don’t need to read this book cover to cover. If there’s a particular chapter you’re interested in, read it first. In some cases, I reference concepts discussed in previous chapters, but in doing so, I try to note where I’ve defined the term so you can refer to relevant sections. Keep this book open while you hack.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="introlev1sec3"><strong>What’s in This Book</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Here’s an overview of what you’ll find in each chapter:</p>&#13;
<p class="hangt"><strong><a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1: Bug Bounty Basics</a></strong> explains what vulnerabilities and bug bounties are and the difference between clients and servers. It also covers how the internet works, which includes HTTP requests, responses, and methods and what it means to say HTTP is stateless.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong><a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2: Open Redirect</a></strong> covers attacks that exploit the trust of a given domain to redirect users to a different one.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong><a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3: HTTP Parameter Pollution</a></strong> covers how attackers manipulate HTTP requests, injecting additional parameters that the vulnerable target website trusts and that lead to unexpected behavior.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong><a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4: Cross-Site Request Forgery</a></strong> covers how an attacker can use a malicious website to make a target’s browser send an HTTP request to another website. The other website then acts as though the request is legitimate and sent intentionally by the target.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong><a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">Chapter 5: HTML Injection and Content Spoofing</a></strong> explains how malicious users inject HTML elements of their own design into a targeted site’s web pages.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong><a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06">Chapter 6: Carriage Return Line Feed Injection</a></strong> shows how attackers inject encoded characters into HTTP messages to alter how servers, proxies, and browsers interpret them.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong><a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07">Chapter 7: Cross-Site Scripting</a></strong> explains how attackers exploit a site that doesn’t sanitize user input to execute their own JavaScript code on the site.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxiv"/><strong><a href="ch08.xhtml#ch08">Chapter 8: Template Injection</a></strong> explains how attackers exploit template engines when a site doesn’t sanitize the user input it uses in its templates. The chapter includes client- and server-side examples.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong><a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09">Chapter 9: SQL Injection</a></strong> describes how a vulnerability on a database-backed site can allow an attacker to unexpectedly query or attack the site’s database.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong><a href="ch10.xhtml#ch10">Chapter 10: Server-Side Request Forgery</a></strong> explains how an attacker makes a server perform unintended network requests.</p>&#13;
<p class="hang"><strong><a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11: XML External Entity</a></strong> shows how attackers exploit the way an application parses XML input and processes the inclusion of external entities in its input.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="introlev1sec4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxv"/><strong>A Disclaimer About Hacking</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">When you read about public vulnerability disclosures and see the amount of money some hackers make, it’s natural to think that hacking is an easy and quick way to get rich. It isn’t. Hacking can be rewarding, but you’re less likely to find stories about the failures that happen along the way (except in this book, where I share some very embarrassing stories). Because you’ll mostly hear about people’s hacking successes, you might develop unrealistic expectations of your own hacking journey.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You might find success very quickly. But if you’re having trouble finding bugs, keep digging. Developers will always be writing new code, and bugs will always make their way into production. The more you try, the easier the process should become.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">On that note, feel free to message me on Twitter @yaworsk and let me know how it’s going. Even if you’re unsuccessful, I’d like to hear from you. Bug hunting can be lonely work if you’re struggling. But it’s also awesome to celebrate with each other, and maybe you’ll find something I can include in the next edition of this book.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Good luck and happy hacking.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxvi"/></p>&#13;

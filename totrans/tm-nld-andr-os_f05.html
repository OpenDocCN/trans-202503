<p class="BodyFirst">Chet has spent many years working in high-tech companies across Silicon Valley, usually on graphics software. He joined the Android team at Google in 2010, where he has written animation and UI software, led the UI toolkit team, served as Android’s Chief Advocate in developer relations, and is now an engineer in the graphics team. He writes books and articles, creates videos, and gives presentations, either humorous or technical (often both). This is Chet’s sixth book. His other books include two programming books, two humor books, and one slim volume of poetry about donuts.</p>

- en: Thank you for reading my book! I hope by now you understand how WebAssembly
    works at a low level and are ready to begin using it for high-level and low-level
    web development. WebAssembly is a young technology, but itâ€™s already available
    in every major browser. Using Node.js, you can also develop high-performance server
    code as WebAssembly modules. More languages for developing WebAssembly applications
    become available all the time. New features and platforms are being added. The
    future is a world where the web is safe, secure, and fast with WebAssembly.

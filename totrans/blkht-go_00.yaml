- en: For about six years, the three of us led one of North America’s largest dedicated
    penetration-testing consulting practices. As principal consultants, we executed
    technical project work, including network penetration tests, on behalf of our
    clients—but we also spearheaded the development of better tools, processes, and
    methodology. And at some point, we adopted Go as one of our primary development
    languages.

    between performance, safety, and user-friendliness. Soon, we defaulted to it as
    our language of choice when developing tools. Eventually, we even found ourselves
    acting as advocates of the language, pushing for our colleagues in the security
    industry to try it. We felt the benefits of Go were at least worthy of consideration.

    from the perspective of security practitioners and hackers. Unlike other hacking
    books, we won’t just show you how to automate third-party or commercial tools
    (although we’ll touch on that a little). Instead, we’ll delve into practical and
    diverse topics that approach a specific problem, protocol, or tactic useful to
    adversaries. We’ll cover TCP, HTTP, and DNS communications, interact with Metasploit
    and Shodan, search filesystems and databases, port exploits from other languages
    to Go, write the core functions of an SMB client, attack Windows, cross-compile
    binaries, mess with crypto, call C libraries, interact with the Windows API, and
    much, much more. It’s ambitious! We’d better begin . . .

- en: This book is for anyone who wants to learn how to develop their own hacking
    tools using Go. Throughout our professional careers, and particularly as consultants,
    we’ve advocated for programming as a fundamental skill for penetration testers
    and security professionals. Specifically, the ability to code enhances your understanding
    of how software works and how it can be broken. Also, if you’ve walked in a developer’s
    shoes, you’ll gain a more holistic appreciation for the challenges they face in
    securing software, and you can use your personal experience to better recommend
    mitigations, eliminate false positives, and locate obscure vulnerabilities. Coding
    often forces you to interact with third-party libraries and various application
    stacks and frameworks. For many people (us included), it’s hands-on experience
    and tinkering that leads to the greatest personal development.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is not an introduction to Go programming in general but an introduction
    to using Go for developing security tools. We are hackers and then coders—in that
    order. None of us have ever been software engineers. This means that, as hackers,
    we put a premium on function over elegance. In many instances, we’ve opted to
    code as hackers do, disregarding some of the idioms or best practices of software
    design. As consultants, time is always scarce; developing simpler code is often
    faster and, therefore, preferable over elegance. When you need to quickly create
    a solution to a problem, style concerns come secondary.

- en: This is bound to anger Go purists, who will likely tweet at us that we don’t
    gracefully handle all error conditions, that our examples could be optimized,
    or that better constructs or methods are available to produce the desired results.
    We’re not, in most cases, concerned with teaching you the best, the most elegant,
    or 100 percent idiomatic solutions, unless doing so will concretely benefit the
    end result. Although we’ll briefly cover the language syntax, we do so purely
    to establish a baseline foundation upon which we can build. After all, this isn’t
    *Learning to Program Elegantly with Go*—this is *Black Hat Go*.

- en: Prior to Go, you could prioritize ease of use by using dynamically typed languages—such
    as Python, Ruby, or PHP—at the expense of performance and safety. Alternatively,
    you could choose a statically typed language, like C or C++, that offers high
    performance and safety but isn’t very user-friendly. Go is stripped of much of
    the ugliness of C, its primary ancestor, making development more user-friendly.
    At the same time, it’s a statically typed language that produces syntax errors
    at compile time, increasing your assurance that your code will actually run safely.
    As it’s compiled, it performs more optimally than interpreted languages and was
    designed with multicore computing considerations, making concurrent programming
    a breeze.

    of ports using parsed command line options. This will highlight the simplicity
    of Go code compared to other languages and will develop your understanding of
    basic types, user input, and error handling. Next, we’ll discuss how to improve
    the efficiency and speed of this port scanner by introducing concurrent functions.
    We’ll then introduce I/O by building a TCP proxy—a port forwarder—starting with
    basic examples and refining our code to create a more reliable solution. Lastly,
    we’ll re-create Netcat’s “gaping security hole” feature in Go, teaching you how
    to run operating system commands while manipulating stdin and stdout and redirecting

    were talking about a holiday card organizer or an app that can turn someone into
    a kitten. Well, you can be the person who makes that app! In this book, you’ll
    learn how to program in Swift, the language used for mobile applications that
    run on all Apple devices. By the time you’ve finished reading, you’ll have developed
    apps you can run on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch.

- en: If you’re new to programming, Swift is a great first programming language. It’s
    modern and powerful, yet fun and easy to learn. You can write Swift in Xcode’s
    playground, which lets you see the results of your code immediately. Once you
    have the basics down, you can go from using the playground to creating mobile
    apps in Xcode that you can carry everywhere—right in your pocket!

    and creativity. For these reasons and many more, programming is a highly useful
    skill to have. Even if you don’t intend to become a professional programmer, if
    you regularly use a computer or a mobile device, then learning to program can
    improve your life.

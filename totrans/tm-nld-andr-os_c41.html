<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">T</span>he launch of Android 1.0 happened in four phases in the Fall of 2008.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c41-0001">September 23: Android SDK</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The first piece of the launch was the SDK itself, when 1.0 was released on September 23, 2008. On one hand, 1.0 was just another update in a long series of updates since the initial m3 release 10 months before, up through the 0.9 release a mere five weeks earlier, on August 18.</p>
<p>But 1.0 was more than another iteration; it was, well, <em>1.0.</em> It represented the team’s final thoughts on what the official, supported API would be for Android from here on out, because there was no more changing of APIs without breaking applications that had been built against them.</p>
<p>In typical fashion, Google simply released this developer product without big fanfare. There was no press event; just some bits uploaded to a server, along with Release Notes about the fixes that were in this version. Even the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_326" title="326"/>introductory sentence of the Release Notes is understated. If you didn’t know what you were looking at, you’d think it was just another update (which, to some extent, it was): </p>

<figcaption><p>The Release Notes for the major bombshell of the 1.0 release were . . . understated.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But these release notes do contain a key feature-omission apology: <em>“We regret to inform developers that Android 1.0 will </em><em>not include support for dot-matrix printers.”</em></p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c41-0002">September 23: T-Mobile G1 Announcement</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Google didn’t gather the media for the developer-targeted SDK launch, but they did get up on stage at a press conference in New York City with T-Mobile to announce the consumer phone that would run 1.0. The same day as the 1.0 SDK shipped, representatives talked about the new device, and T-Mobile issued a press release entitled, “T-Mobile Unveils the T-Mobile G1—the First Phone Powered by Android.”</p>
<p>The G1 device would have a touchscreen, a slide-to-open QWERTY keyboard, and a trackball. It would run Google Maps, search, and it would offer apps from Android Market. It would come with a three-megapixel camera and would run on T-Mobile’s new 3G network. It would sell for $179 on contract, or $399 unlocked, starting in the US and expanding to other countries in the following weeks.</p>
<p>And it would be available in a month. Customers could pre-order the G1, but would have to wait until October 22 to get one.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c41-0003">October 21: Open Source</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">One day before the G1 became available, the source code for 1.0 was posted. Once again, there was no big, staged event for this developer-focused <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_327" title="327"/>release. In fact, this time there wasn’t even a press release, just a short three-paragraph blurb on the Android Developers Blog<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c41-footnote-1" id="c41-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup> with the title, “Android is now Open Source.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t much. But it was <em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>Android had planned on having an open source platform since before it existed. It had pitched the idea to investors, to Google, to team members, to carrier and manufacturer partners, and to developers worldwide. And now, 11 months after the first public SDK and one month after 1.0, it made good on all of those promises and published all of the code for everyone to see and use.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c41-0004">October 22: T-Mobile G1 Available</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">On October 22, one day after Android was open sourced, the G1 was finally available for people outside of Google to try and to buy. </p>

<p>When the G1 went on sale at the T-Mobile store on Market Street in San Francisco, Romain Guy was there, taking a picture of the first buyer. Nowadays, it’s hard to imagine caring who is buying what phone where, but at the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_328" title="328"/>time, this first purchase was the culmination of years of hard work by the development team; it was exciting to see their efforts make it into the real world and to see people line up to purchase them. Someone else who was at the store that day was Bob Borchers, the Senior Director of Product Marketing for the iPhone. He was purchasing one for his team to play around with back at Apple.</p>

<p>The G1 was the first in a long line of devices that were developed as a collaboration between manufacturer (HTC), carrier (T-Mobile), and Google. The original idea behind these Google-collaboration devices was that they would showcase the new capabilities of the latest release. At the same time, these phones also allowed the team to prove out new functionality to ensure that what was being built actually worked on real hardware. In the case of the G1, this hardware allowed the team to prove that the Android platform worked, could provide full capabilities for a functional consumer device, and could provide building blocks for more platform functionality and more devices to come.</p>

- en: Even though containers are designed to hide some of the complexity of the individual
    hosts in a cluster and their underlying hardware, real-world applications need
    tuning to get the most out of the available computing power. This tuning must
    be done in a way that works with the scalability and resiliency of our Kubernetes
    cluster so that we donâ€™t lose the advantages of dynamic scheduling and horizontal
    scaling. In other words, we need to provide hints to a cluster to help it schedule
    containers in the most efficient way.

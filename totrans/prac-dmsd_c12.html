			<p class="ChapterIntro">In some of the more radical flavors of survivalist lore, no sin is as grave as letting others know that you prep. The thinking is that the unwashed masses are irredeemable and destined to perish in the wake of The Event, so there’s no need to trouble yourself with helping them; as for survivalists who spill the beans, they’ll undoubtedly have to fend off angry mobs clamoring for a share of their supplies. Moved by such visions, many newcomers to the community go to great lengths to conceal their hobby—not just from neighbors or relatives, but also from delivery people, banks, and other perceived prying eyes.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_120" title="120"/>I don’t buy this philosophy. Of course, restraint has merit: nothing good can come of posting selfies with gold bars or wads of cash, and in a widespread and profound downturn, the number of souls a single person can help is limited. But in trying times, people almost always come together and find strength in local communities. It’s much better to be a part of a resilient group than a lone warrior trying to take on the world. Given the localized nature of most disasters, it’s also better if your group consists of neighbors, coworkers, and relatives, rather than a scattered collection of internet strangers who live hundreds of miles apart.</p>
			<p>Further, most disasters aren’t the end of the world. A week-long power outage is a fantastic opportunity to make friends and support neighbors in small ways; it would be a shame to barricade the door the moment the lights go out, anticipating that they might never come back on. It’s also good to remember that most disasters don’t unfold precisely as planned. If you break a leg in the midst of the commotion, or if your supplies are damaged or spoiled, having self-sufficient kindred spirits you can turn to can make all the difference in the world.</p>
			<p>
				I suspect the reason some members of the prepping community are so insular is that they don’t feel taken seriously by the outside world. The obligatory and harmless joke uttered by many outsiders—“Oh, you’re a prepper. I know where to go if I need anything!”—is taken as a genuine threat. Some of the difficulties the prepared encounter have to do with the lingering toxic influence of TV series such as <em>Doomsday Preppers</em>, but some of the pain is clearly self-inflicted: when survivalists unload fringe critiques of fractional reserve banking or their theories of nuclear warfare onto an uninitiated audience, it’s hard to blame the other party if all they can come back with is a blank stare or an off-the-cuff joke.</p>
			<p>My favorite approach to getting folks interested in emergency preparedness isn’t to school them on how they should be living their lives or to bury them in data, but to casually bring up a perilous experience lived by a common friend, or to mention a regional disaster that happened some weeks back. Then, rather than giving my conversation partner unsolicited advice, I ask them how they feel about it, and if there’s anything we could conceivably do to protect our families. If they laugh it off, I might try once more some time later, perhaps bringing up one of the simple steps I decided to take, but then leave it at that. The goal isn’t to convert; it’s to plant the seed of rational doubt about their current approach to managing risk. It can be months before the seed takes hold, and if it never does, that’s fine. Not prepping is a rational choice too.</p>
			<p>Beyond building a network of like-minded individuals interested in disaster preparedness, cultivating neighborly relationships throughout your community in a more basic way is also worthwhile. In a crisis that overwhelms hospitals, for instance, being on good terms with a veterinarian or a physician can help avoid misery or even save a life. For introverts and extroverts alike, it pays to say hi to neighbors, engage in small talk, and offer to help with minor hurdles every now and then; finding common interests is a powerful bonding method too. I figure that even if the zombie apocalypse never comes, such gestures can’t be a waste of time.</p>

    a few more features of HTML5\. Right now, the bubble grid could fill up the entire
    page in no time, giving players no room to fire bubbles. To prevent this from
    happening, we’ll make the game end if the player adds more than two rows to the
    bottom of the board. We’ll also implement multiple levels and high scores using
    the Local Storage API, smooth out animation with `requestAnimationFrame`, and
    add sound to the game with HTML5\. Let’s start by adding multiple levels and high
    scores.

    inside the `Game` object. I’ve opted for the latter because there are only three
    values to track. If you need to track more information or if the information to
    track is more complex, it’s best to store the data in its own object to keep *game.js*

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the client side, Web Storage behaves in a similar way to cookies, but the
    implementation details (and advantages) are very different. Web Storage is easier
    to access than cookies are because data is stored in name/value pairs. Unlike
    with cookies, there is no server-side access to the contents of Web Storage, because
    data isn’t transmitted as part of an HTTP request. The contents of the store are
    restricted by domain, so different subdomains have different stores. We could
    store the high score in a cookie, but there’s no reason to do so, and the storage
    format as well as the overhead of transmitting data unnecessarily to the server
    on each request makes a cookie a worse option than Web Storage. Trying to store
    large amounts of data (such as the layout of the current board) in a cookie can
    also cause performance issues, because this data is transmitted to the server
    with each request. For example, when the browser tries to download an image file
    of only a few kilobytes, it could also have to send a large amount of extraneous
    data to the server.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Web Storage, on the other hand, gives you more space than cookies do, although
    the exact amount isn’t defined in the HTML specification and is set individually
    by the browser vendors. The current lowest common figure among the main web browsers
    is 5MB; that limit applies to all data stored within a domain. Google Chrome,
    Firefox, and Internet Explorer 9 on a desktop all provide up to 10MB, but the
    Android browser on phone and tablet devices provides as little as 2MB. Compare
    that with the maximum cookie storage—anything upwards of 300 cookies of 4KB each—and
    you can see that even at the lower limits, Web Storage provides much more storage.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of data into Web Storage, there’s no substitute for testing on specific devices;

    limits are irrelevant.

    if the browser is busy with something else, the next iteration may not be called

    user will start to notice.

    time elapsed since the last update, effectively ignoring the 40 millisecond figure.
    But we’d still have to accept the fact that whatever value we set the timeout
    delay to will be too low for some setups and those displays won’t be able to keep
    up. On systems that can handle much faster updates, we could display much smoother
    animations, but if we set the timeout value to 10 milliseconds to handle those
    cases, slower systems will see an adverse effect.

    that is better suited to animation. Rather than making the programmer guess what
    kind of frame rate *might* work, the browser calls the function passed to `requestAnimationFrame`
    whenever it is ready to draw a new update. The time between updates might be much
    faster (or slower!) than 40 milliseconds, but at least we know that we’re neither
    making a processing logjam worse nor having the system sit idle when we could
    spend extra cycles smoothing the animations.

    did happen to run this routine every 40 milliseconds, we wouldn’t need to change
    anything. But if it ran every, say, 20 milliseconds, we couldn’t keep the same
    values of `dx` and `dy`, or our whole animation would run much faster—twice as
    fast, in fact, because it would add `dx` and `dy` twice as often.

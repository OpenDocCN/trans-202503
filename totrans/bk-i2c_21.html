<p class="ChapterIntro">This concludes the treeware version of <em>The Book of I</em><sup><em>2</em></sup><em>C</em>. However, this is only the beginning of your journey toward learning how to program I<sup>2</sup>C devices. There are hundreds of different I<sup>2</sup>C devices in the real world, with more appearing all the time. No matter how many devices I describe in this book, it will eventually become out of date as manufacturers create new devices. </p>&#13;
<p>Indeed, as this book was being edited, two new and important devices arrived: the MCP4728 quad DAC and the Raspberry Pi Pico. That’s in addition to the many common devices already on the market, with boards produced by Adafruit, SparkFun, Seeed Studio, and others. </p>&#13;
<p>As discussed in the introduction, to keep the page count and cost of this book reasonable, I’ve chosen to move the discussion of several devices onto my website at <a class="LinkURL" href="https://www.randallhyde.com/bookofi2c">https://www.randallhyde.com/bookofi2c</a>. Chapters 17 and beyond of this book will appear on that site, making them easy to update and extend as time permits and new devices become popular. Appendix B <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_384" title="384"/>in this book describes currently planned online chapters, but I intend to add more in the future. Please visit the website to find additional support material, expanded example code, and links to other information on I<sup>2</sup>C programming. </p>&#13;
<p>Even without the online materials, this book has taught you almost everything you need to know to begin using I<sup>2</sup>C peripherals. At this point, you should be able to read through a device’s datasheet and use that information to program any I<sup>2</sup>C device out there. Good luck, and happy programming!</p>&#13;

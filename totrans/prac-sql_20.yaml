    it helps unearth the stories in your data. As you’ve learned, SQL gives you the
    tools to find interesting trends, insights, or anomalies in your data and then
    make smart decisions based on what you’ve learned. But how do you identify these
    trends from just a collection of rows and columns? And how can you glean meaningful
    insights from these trends after identifying them?'

    to discover stories in data and communicate my findings. I’ll start with how to
    generate ideas by asking good questions and gathering and exploring data. Then
    I explain the analysis process, which culminates in presenting your findings clearly.
    Identifying trends in your dataset and creating a narrative of your findings sometimes
    requires considerable experimentation and enough fortitude to weather the occasional
    dead end. Regard these tips as less of a checklist and more of a guideline to
    help ensure a thorough analysis that minimizes mistakes.

- en: Curiosity, intuition, or sometimes just dumb luck can often spark ideas for
    data analysis. If you’re a keen observer of your surroundings, you might notice
    changes in your community over time and wonder if you can measure that change.
    Consider your local real estate market. If you see “For Sale” signs popping up
    around town more than usual, you might start asking questions. Is there a dramatic
    increase in home sales this year compared with last year? If so, by how much?
    Which neighborhoods are riding the wave? These questions create a great opportunity
    for data analysis. If you’re a journalist, you might find a story. If you run
    a business, you might see a marketing opportunity.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Likewise, if you surmise that a trend is occurring in your industry, confirming
    it might provide you with a business opportunity. For example, if you suspect
    that sales of a particular product are sluggish, you can analyze data to confirm
    the hunch and adjust inventory or marketing efforts appropriately.

    Analyzing data to satisfy your curiosity is perfectly fine, but if the answers

    and reproducible. For the sake of credibility, others in your organization as
    well as those outside it should be able to reproduce your work. In addition, make
    sure you document enough of your process so that if you set the project aside
    for several weeks, you won’t have trouble getting up to speed when you return
    to it.

    creating step-by-step SQL queries that another person could follow to replicate
    your data import, cleaning, and analysis can make it easier for others to verify
    your findings. Some analysts store notes and code in a text file. Others use version
    control systems, such as GitHub, or work in code notebooks. What’s important is
    you create a system of documentation and use it consistently.

    relates to the trend or question. If you’re working in an organization that already
    has its own data on the topic, lucky you—you’re set! In that case, you might be
    able to tap internal marketing or sales databases, customer relationship management
    (CRM) systems, or subscriber or event registration data. But if your topic encompasses
    broader issues involving demographics, the economy, or industry-specific subjects,
    you’ll need to do some digging.

    government decision-makers, and academics can point you to available data and
    describe its usefulness. Federal, state, and local governments, as you’ve seen
    throughout the book, produce volumes of data on all kinds of topics. In the United
    States, check out the federal government’s data catalog site at [https://www.data.gov/](https://www.data.gov/)
    or individual federal agency sites, such as the National Center for Education
    Statistics (NCES) at [https://nces.ed.gov/](https://nces.ed.gov/) or the Bureau
    of Labor Statistics at [https://www.bls.gov/](https://www.bls.gov/).

    to fill out or a report formatted in rows and columns, those are signs that structured
    data might be available for analysis. All is not lost if you have access only
    to unstructured data, though—as you learned in Chapter 14, you can even mine unstructured
    data, such as text files, for analysis.

    examining five or ten years or more, instead of just one or two, if possible.
    Analyzing a snapshot of data collected over a month or a year can yield interesting
    results, but many trends play out over a longer period of time and may not be
    evident if you look at a single year of data. I’ll discuss this further in the
    section “Identify Key Indicators and Trends over Time.”

    That is what my *USA Today* colleague Robert Davis and I did when we wanted to
    study issues related to the deaths of college students on campuses in the United
    States. Not a single organization—not the schools or state or federal officials—could
    tell us how many college students were dying each year from accidents, overdoses,
    or illnesses on campus. We decided to collect our own data and structure the information
    into tables in a database.

    to student deaths. After finding reports of more than 600 student deaths from
    2000 to 2005, we followed up with interviews with education experts, police, school
    officials, and parents. From each report, we cataloged details such as each student’s
    age, school, cause of death, year in school, and whether drugs or alcohol played
    a role. Our findings led to the publication of the article “In College, First
    Year Is by Far the Riskiest” in *USA Today* in 2006\. The story featured the key
    finding from the analysis of our SQL database: freshmen were particularly vulnerable
    and accounted for the highest percentage of the student deaths we studied.'

    producer data included the same company names spelled in multiple ways. It’s worth
    knowing why. (Perhaps the data is manually copied from a written form to a computer.)
    Similarly, the New York City taxi data you analyzed in Chapter 12 records the
    start and end times of each trip. This begs the question of when the timer starts
    and stops—when the passenger gets in and out of the vehicle, or is there some
    other trigger? You should know these details not only to draw better conclusions
    from analysis but also to pass them along to others who might be interpreting
    your analysis.

    your findings. For example, with US Census Bureau data, it’s important to know
    that the decennial census conducted every 10 years is a complete count of the
    population, whereas the American Community Survey (ACS) is drawn from only a sample
    of households. As a result, ACS counts have a margin of error, but the decennial
    census doesn’t. It would be irresponsible to report on the ACS without considering
    that the margin of error could render differences between numbers insignificant.

    by column values should reveal minimum and maximum values, potential issues with
    duplicate entries, and a sense of the general scope of your data. If your database
    contains multiple, related tables, try joins to make sure you understand how the
    tables relate. Using `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`, as you learned in Chapter 7,
    should show whether key values from one table are missing in another. That may
    or may not be a concern, but at least you’ll be able to identify potential problems
    to address. Jot down a list of questions or concerns you have, and then move on
    to the next step.

    that gave you the data, or the person might be an analyst who has worked with
    the data before. This step is your chance to clarify your understanding of the
    data, verify initial findings, and discover whether the data has any issues that
    make it unsuitable for your needs.

    to be gross outliers (such as dates in the future for events that were supposed
    to have happened in the past), you should ask about that discrepancy. If you expect
    to find someone’s name in a table (perhaps even your own name) and it’s not there,
    that should prompt another question. Is it possible you don’t have the whole dataset,

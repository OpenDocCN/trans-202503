    it helps unearth the stories in your data. As you’ve learned, SQL gives you the
    tools to find interesting trends, insights, or anomalies in your data and then
    make smart decisions based on what you’ve learned. But how do you identify these
    trends from just a collection of rows and columns? And how can you glean meaningful
    insights from these trends after identifying them?'

    changes in your community over time and wonder if you can measure that change.
    Consider your local real estate market. If you see “For Sale” signs popping up
    around town more than usual, you might start asking questions. Is there a dramatic
    increase in home sales this year compared with last year? If so, by how much?
    Which neighborhoods are riding the wave? These questions create a great opportunity

    That is what my *USA Today* colleague Robert Davis and I did when we wanted to
    study issues related to the deaths of college students on campuses in the United
    States. Not a single organization—not the schools or state or federal officials—could
    tell us how many college students were dying each year from accidents, overdoses,
    or illnesses on campus. We decided to collect our own data and structure the information
    into tables in a database.

    to student deaths. After finding reports of more than 600 student deaths from
    2000 to 2005, we followed up with interviews with education experts, police, school
    officials, and parents. From each report, we cataloged details such as each student’s
    age, school, cause of death, year in school, and whether drugs or alcohol played
    a role. Our findings led to the publication of the article “In College, First
    Year Is by Far the Riskiest” in *USA Today* in 2006\. The story featured the key
    finding from the analysis of our SQL database: freshmen were particularly vulnerable
    and accounted for the highest percentage of the student deaths we studied.'

    Similarly, the New York City taxi data you analyzed in Chapter 12 records the
    start and end times of each trip. This begs the question of when the timer starts
    and stops—when the passenger gets in and out of the vehicle, or is there some
    other trigger? You should know these details not only to draw better conclusions

    population, whereas the American Community Survey (ACS) is drawn from only a sample
    of households. As a result, ACS counts have a margin of error, but the decennial
    census doesn’t. It would be irresponsible to report on the ACS without considering
    that the margin of error could render differences between numbers insignificant.

    should show whether key values from one table are missing in another. That may
    or may not be a concern, but at least you’ll be able to identify potential problems
    to address. Jot down a list of questions or concerns you have, and then move on

- en: I hope you’ve come away with data analysis skills you can start using immediately
    on the everyday data you encounter. More importantly, I hope you’ve seen that
    each dataset has a story, or several stories, to tell. Identifying and telling
    these stories is what makes working with data worthwhile; it’s more than just
    combing through a collection of rows and columns. I look forward to hearing about
    what you discover!

  zh: 我希望你已经掌握了数据分析技能，能够立即应用到你日常遇到的数据中。更重要的是，我希望你已经看到每个数据集都有一个故事，或者多个故事可以讲述。识别并讲述这些故事是与数据工作值得的原因；它不仅仅是翻看一堆行和列。我期待听到你所发现的内容！

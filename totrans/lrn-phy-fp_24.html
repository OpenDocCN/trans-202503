<p class="noindent">When we think about electricity, we often think about how it’s used, like the electric current flowing through a telephone wire or emerging from a battery. But all electrical technologies start from a single concept: electric charge. Electric charge has something to do with all electrical phenomena, and it’s the logical starting place for our discussion.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Accordingly, we’ll begin this chapter by describing electric charge. We’ll then discuss Coulomb’s late 18th century theory of electricity, which is specified by Coulomb’s law. Finally, we’ll put this theory to use in examining the motion of two charged particles repelling each other.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch21lev1">Electric Charge</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><em>Electric charge</em> is a quantity associated with a particle or object that determines whether and how it can participate in electrical phenomena. In the 1700s, people discovered that there were two types of electric charge. Charges of the same type repelled each other and charges of different types attracted <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_410"/>each other. Later, when physicists discovered subatomic particles, they decided that the proton was positive and the electron negative, but that was an arbitrary choice that everyone now respects as a convention.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The SI unit of charge is the Coulomb (C), named after Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, the French physicist of the late 18th century who did groundbreaking work on electricity. <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21tab1">Table 21-1</a> gives the charges of the proton, the electron, and the neutron. The charge of a proton is <em>exactly</em> 1.602176634 × 10<sup>–19</sup> C. How can the charge of a proton be known exactly? Since 2019, the SI <em>defines</em> the Coulomb to be that quantity of charge such that an <em>elementary charge</em> is exactly 1.602176634 × 10 <sup>–19</sup> C. The proton is thought to possess one unit of elementary charge, and the electron negative one unit. The proton and electron are known experimentally to have equal (but opposite) charges to better than one part in 10<sup>18</sup>. In equations, we use <em>q</em> or <em>Q</em> as a symbol for charge.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">Charge is a scalar, not a vector. Charge is represented by a real number. This suggests that the type for charge should be real numbers.</p>&#13;
<pre>type Charge = R</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_411"/>Let’s encode the value of the elementary charge.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">Charge is quantized—that is, it occurs in discrete lumps—but this fact does not play a role in classical electromagnetic theory. In fact, the size of the lumps of charge are so small that we often want to think of charge as more like a fluid. Don’t worry if that doesn’t make sense quite yet; we’ll discuss continuous charge distributions in <a href="ch24.xhtml">Chapter 24</a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Charge is also conserved. If the charge in any volume changes, it must flow in or out through the boundary surface of the volume.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The most important and interesting questions about charge are not about its intrinsic nature but rather about the relationships and interactions between charged particles. How do charges interact?</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch21lev2">Coulomb’s Law</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Charles-Augustin de Coulomb was the first to give a quantitative relationship describing the interaction of two charged particles. He showed that the force exerted by one point charge on another is directly proportional to each charge and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. As an equation, Coulomb’s law can be written as</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/411equ01.jpg" alt="Image" width="397" height="49"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">where <em>q</em><sub>1</sub> is the charge of particle 1, <em>q</em><sub>2</sub> is the charge of particle 2, and <em>r</em> is the distance between the particles. This equation gives the magnitude of the force produced by particle 1 on particle 2, which, by Newton’s third law, is the same as the magnitude of the force produced by particle 2 on particle 1. The direction of the force depends on the signs of the charges; the force is repulsive for like charges and attractive for unlike charges. In SI units, the constant <em>k</em> is</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/411equ02.jpg" alt="Image" width="264" height="48"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">The constant ϵ<sub>0</sub>, called the <em>vacuum electric permittivity</em>, <em>electric constant</em>, or <em>permittivity of free space</em>, serves as a kind of bridge between electrical units, such as the Coulomb, and mechanical units, such as the Newton. The expression 1/(4<em>π</em>ϵ<sub>0</sub>) is often used instead of <em>k</em> as <em>k</em> is an overused symbol in physics.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here is a translation of Equation 21.1 into Haskell:</p>&#13;
<pre>coulombMagnitude :: Charge -&gt; Charge -&gt; R -&gt; R&#13;
coulombMagnitude q1 q2 r&#13;
    = let k = 9e9  -- in N m^2 / C^2&#13;
      in k * abs (q1 * q2) / r**2</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">We can use vector notation to give a more comprehensive version of Coulomb’s law, which includes the direction of the force in the equation. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_412"/>We’ll define the displacement vector <strong>r</strong><sub>21</sub> to be the vector that points from particle 1 to particle 2, as in <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fig1">Figure 21-1</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="imagel" id="ch21fig1"><img src="Images/412equ01.jpg" alt="Image" width="249" height="166"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 21-1: The displacement vector <strong>r</strong><sub>21</sub> points from particle 1 to particle 2.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The force <strong>F</strong><sub>21</sub> exerted <em>on</em> particle 2 produced <em>by</em> particle 1 is given in vector notation as follows:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/412equ02.jpg" alt="Image" width="429" height="52"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notice that if both charges are positive, the force <strong>F</strong><sub>21</sub> on particle 2 points in the same direction as the displacement vector <strong>r</strong><sub>21</sub>, away from particle 1, as we expect for like charges. If the charges have unlike signs, the direction of <strong>F</strong><sub>21</sub> will flip, indicating an attractive force.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If <strong>r</strong><sub>1</sub> is the position vector for particle 1 and <strong>r</strong><sub>2</sub> is the position vector for particle 2, then <strong>r</strong><sub>21</sub>= <strong>r</strong><sub>2</sub> – <strong>r</strong><sub>1</sub> and we can write the force on particle 2 as follows:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/412equ03.jpg" alt="Image" width="444" height="52"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">In summary, Coulomb’s law 21.1 is simpler, and Coulomb’s laws 21.2 and 21.3 are more powerful since the direction of the force is encoded in the equations.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This Coulomb interaction is a <span class="literal">TwoBodyForce</span> of the kind we discussed in <a href="ch19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>. Here is Equation 21.3 in Haskell:</p>&#13;
<pre>coulombForce :: TwoBodyForce&#13;
coulombForce st1 st2&#13;
    = let k = 9e9  -- N m^2 / C^2&#13;
          q1 = charge st1&#13;
          q2 = charge st2&#13;
      in centralForce (\r -&gt; k * q1 * q2 / r**2) st1 st2</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">The Coulomb force is another example of a central force, so here we use the <span class="literal">centralForce</span> function we defined in <a href="ch19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Having encoded Coulomb’s law as a two-body force, let’s apply it to a situation of two protons repelling one another.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch21lev3">Two Charges Interacting</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Suppose we release two protons with an initial separation of 1 cm. How far will they travel in five milliseconds? This is a good problem for the tools we <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_413"/>developed in the previous chapters, especially <a href="ch19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>. The problem cannot be solved using only algebra because the force diminishes as the particles move farther apart. The particles start from rest and accelerate away from each other, and this acceleration decreases as the repulsive force decreases. When the two protons are far apart, the force decreases to a negligible magnitude and the protons approach a terminal velocity.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch21lev4">Looking at Extremes</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Before we apply the multi-particle tools of <a href="ch19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>, let’s see how much we can learn about this situation by thinking about two extremes: what happens in the first few moments and what happens after a long time.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For very short times, before the particles move much, we can approximate the initial acceleration as constant. We can obtain the initial acceleration of one of the protons by dividing the net force</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/413equ01.jpg" alt="Image" width="33" height="54"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">where <em>q<sub>p</sub></em> is the charge of a proton and <em>d</em> is 1 cm, by the mass <em>m<sub>p</sub></em> of a proton:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/413equ02.jpg" alt="Image" width="225" height="62"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Treating this acceleration as constant, the velocity and position of one proton are</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/413equ03.jpg" alt="Image" width="433" height="20"/></div>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/413equ04.jpg" alt="Image" width="433" height="44"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">from the constant acceleration Equations 4.14 and 4.15. These equations are a good approximation for a short time, but extending them for too long is overly ambitious and gives poor results. We’ll call this approximation the “constant acceleration approximation.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">After the protons have been moving for some time, the particles will approach a terminal velocity. We can find this terminal velocity using conservation of energy. The potential energy of two charges <em>q</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>q</em><sub>2</sub> separated by a distance <em>d</em> is <em>kq</em><sub>1</sub><em>q</em><sub>2</sub>/<em>d</em>, so the potential energy of two protons a distance <em>d</em> from each other is <img class="inline" src="Images/413equ05.jpg" alt="Image" width="52" height="31"/>. The initial electric potential energy of the two protons is converted into kinetic energy. The kinetic energy of a particle with mass <em>m</em> moving with speed <em>v</em> is<em>mv</em><sup>2</sup>/2. The two protons will approach the same terminal speed <em>υ<sub>T</sub></em>, so conservation of energy leads to the following equation:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/413equ06.jpg" alt="Image" width="200" height="54"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">The terminal speed of each proton is given through conservation of energy by</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/413equ07.jpg" alt="Image" width="215" height="75"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_414"/>For very long times, we can treat the terminal velocity as constant, so the velocity and position of one proton are</p>&#13;

<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/414equ02.jpg" alt="Image" width="405" height="20"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">where <em>x</em><sub>1</sub> is some as-yet-undetermined distance. These equations are a good approximation when <em>t</em> is very large, but applying them for shorter times gives poor results. We will call this approximation the “terminal velocity approximation.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s summarize what we’ve learned from the short-time extreme and the long-time extreme. When released from rest, each proton experiences an acceleration of 1379 m/s<sup>2</sup> away from the other proton. The acceleration decreases as the protons move farther apart, until the acceleration is negligible and the protons obtain the terminal speed of 3.71 m/s. If we were to plot proton velocity as a function of time, the velocity would start at 0 and increase with a slope of 1379 m/s<sup>2</sup>. As time increases, velocity increases, asymptotically approaching the terminal speed of 3.71 m/s.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch21lev5">Modeling the Situation in Haskell</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Now that we have a basic idea of what to expect, let’s apply the tools we developed in <a href="ch19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a> for multiple-particle situations. The only force we need to include is the internal force of the Coulomb interaction between the protons.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">By using <span class="literal">statesMPS</span> from <a href="ch19.xhtml">Chapter 19</a>, we can form an infinite list of multi-particle states.</p>&#13;
<pre>twoProtonStates :: R                     -- time step&#13;
                -&gt; MultiParticleState    -- initial 2-particle state&#13;
                -&gt; [MultiParticleState]  -- infinite list of states&#13;
twoProtonStates dt&#13;
    = statesMPS (eulerCromerMPS dt) [InternalForce 1 0 coulombForce]</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">We supply this function with a time step and an initial two-particle state, and it will give back an infinite list of two-particle states that we can mine for any information we want.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here is a function that sets an initial state with both protons at rest and with an initial separation given as a parameter to the function. The origin in this function is midway between the two protons. The proton mass is from <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21tab1">Table 21-1</a>.</p>&#13;

      in MPS [defaultParticleState { mass   = protonMass&#13;

                                   }&#13;
             ,defaultParticleState { mass   = protonMass&#13;
                                   , charge = elementaryCharge&#13;

                                   }&#13;
             ]</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s start by making a graph of proton velocity as a function of time. The function <span class="literal">oneProtonVelocity</span> returns an infinite list of time-velocity pairs.</p>&#13;
<pre>oneProtonVelocity :: R        -- dt&#13;
                  -&gt; R        -- starting separation&#13;
                  -&gt; [(R,R)]  -- (time,velocity) pairs&#13;
oneProtonVelocity dt d&#13;
    = let state0 = initialTwoProtonState d&#13;
      in [(time st2, xComp $ velocity st2)&#13;
              | MPS [_,st2] &lt;- twoProtonStates dt state0]</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">We construct the list using a list comprehension, and we use pattern matching in the list comprehension to give the name <span class="literal">st2</span> to the state of the second proton. We choose the second proton rather than the first because, based on our initial state, the second proton will have a positive velocity component, while the first proton will have a negative velocity component. Finally, we use the functions <span class="literal">time</span>, <span class="literal">velocity</span>, and <span class="literal">xComp</span> to pick out the values we want to plot.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">It’s not so obvious what time step to use. Let’s try to use dimensional analysis with the parameters of this problem to estimate a characteristic time scale. The relevant parameters for this situation are the proton charge <em>q<sub>p</sub></em>, the proton mass <em>m<sub>p</sub></em>, the electrical constant <em>k</em>, and the distance <em>d</em> of 1 cm. Can we combine these parameters to get a quantity with dimensions of time? We can. The characteristic time scale of the problem is given by</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="Images/415equ01.jpg" alt="Image" width="203" height="75"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">We’ll use a time step of 10<sup>–5</sup> s, which is small compared with the characteristic time scale we just found.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The following list of time-velocity pairs is a finite list of the results we will plot.</p>&#13;
<pre>tvPairs :: [(R,R)]&#13;
tvPairs = takeWhile (\(t,_) -&gt; t &lt;= 2e-2) $&#13;

<p class="indent">We pass the time step <span class="literal">1e-5</span> (10<sup>–5</sup> s) and the initial proton separation <span class="literal">1e-2</span> (1 cm) to the function <span class="literal">oneProtonVelocity</span> to get an infinite list of states. We then truncate this infinite list to a finite list of states occurring up to 20 ms.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_416"/><a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fig2">Figure 21-2</a> shows the velocity of a proton as a function of time.

<p class="indent">Since we created the finite concrete list <span class="literal">tvPairs</span> to hold the data, the plotting code consists mostly in using the <span class="literal">plotPaths</span> function.

<p class="indent">Our original question asked how far a proton would travel in 5 ms. Let’s produce a graph of position versus time for a proton and then answer the original question directly. <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fig3">Figure 21-3</a> shows the position of a proton as a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_417"/>function of time.

<p class="indent">GHCi returns the two-particle state at 5 ms. I have formatted the output for easy readability. The protons are located at –1.55 cm and 1.55 cm along the x-axis, so they are 3.1 cm apart at 5 ms.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch21lev6">Summary</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">We have given an overview of 18th century electrical theory, which works well when particles move slowly compared to the speed of light and don’t experience extreme acceleration. Coulomb’s 18th century theory is still a good theory of static electricity, also called <em>electrostatics</em>. Coulomb’s law is a two-body force, just like Newton’s law of universal gravity. Coulomb’s law is intended to be used in the context of the multi-particle Newtonian mechanics we studied in <a href="part02.xhtml">Part II</a>. An example of this is two protons repelling each other, a problem that, simple as it is to state, is not solvable by simple algebraic methods, but rather requires the ideas and tools we have developed.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the 19th century, Michael Faraday discovered an electrical phenomenon that was not (directly) caused by electric charge. This led to the concepts of electric and magnetic fields, which, in the modern Faraday-Maxwell theory of electricity and magnetism, are the mediators of electric charge. This newer theory is a theory of <em>electrodynamics</em>, and it makes good predictions even when charges are moving rapidly and accelerating strongly. Since this newer theory is a field theory, meaning the players are fields rather than particles, and since a field in physics is a function of three-dimensional space or spacetime, we’ll spend the next two chapters studying coordinate systems and geometry for three-dimensional space.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch21lev7">Exercises</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Exercise 21.1.</strong> Make a plot similar to <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fig2">Figure 21-2</a> for two electrons released from rest with a separation of 1 cm. What are the terminal velocity and characteristic time scale in this case?</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Exercise 21.2.</strong> Coulomb’s theory of electricity predicts that an electron could orbit a proton in much the same way that the Earth orbits the sun. We might call this “classical hydrogen.” (The modern Faraday-Maxwell theory of electricity and magnetism that we will touch on later in this part of the book presents problems for this picture because an accelerating charged particle radiates, making classical hydrogen unstable.) Write an animation for classical hydrogen in which the Coulomb force is the only internal force between the proton and the electron and there are no external forces. You will need to choose some initial conditions for the proton and the electron.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentts"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_419"/><strong>Exercise 21.3.</strong> Consider a proton and an electron released from rest. Write a function to calculate the time until collision given the initial separation. How far apart should they be initially so that it will take one second for them to collide?</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Exercise 21.4.</strong> Animate the two-proton repulsion using gloss or not-gloss.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentts"><strong>Exercise 21.5.</strong> Write code to produce the graph in <a href="ch21.xhtml#ch21fig3">Figure 21-3</a>. Here is some starting code you may use if you wish:</p>&#13;

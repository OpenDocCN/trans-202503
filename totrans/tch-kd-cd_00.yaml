    learning. We use computers to solve problems, play games, help us work more effectively,
    perform repetitive tasks, store and recall information, create something new,
    and connect with our friends and the world. Understanding how to code puts all
    this power at our fingertips.

    apply logic, try a solution, experiment a little more, and then solve the problem.
    The time to start learning to code is *now*! We are at an unprecedented time in
    history: never before could billions of people connect with one another every
    day like we do now with computers. We live in a world of many new possibilities,
    from electric cars and robot caregivers to drones that deliver packages and even
    pizza.'

    game? Coders do that! What about create their own phone app? They can bring that
    idea to life by programming it on a computer! Every program, game, system, or
    app they’ve ever seen was coded using the same programming building blocks they’ll
    learn in this book. When kids program, they take an active role in technology—they’re
    not just *having* fun, they’re *making* something fun!

    college degree in a relevant field is still one of the best ways to prepare for
    a career, but even if college isn’t an option at the moment, your kids can begin
    building a programming portfolio and demonstrating their skills as a programmer
    and problem-solver today.

    who want to understand the basics of computer programming, both to have fun and
    to gain access to new jobs in the high-tech economy. No matter what your age,
    you can have a great time learning the basics of programming. The best way to
    do this is to experiment and work together.

    and your kids follow along with the programs in this book, try changing numbers
    and text in the code to see what happens to the program. Even if you break it,
    you’ll learn something new by fixing it. In the worst case, all you have to do
    is retype the example from the book or open the last saved version that worked.
    The point of learning to code is to try something new, learn a new skill, and
    solve problems in a new way. Make sure your kids are playing around—testing their
    code by changing something, saving the program, running it, seeing what happens,
    and fixing any errors.

    "Figure 2. Three colorful spiral drawings I created by trying different values
    in a line of code in one program")) and then went back, changed some numbers here
    and there, and tried running the program again. This gave me another drawing that
    was completely different but just as amazing. I went back again, changed some
    other numbers, and got yet another beautiful, unique drawing. See what you can
    do just by playing around?

    with their child and even study ahead so they can help their child between lessons.
    Starting early is another hallmark of the Suzuki Method; kids can start formal
    study by the age of three or four.

    with the code to build something new.

of Laurie’s pocket.</p><p>“See what I mean? Let’s hope they don’t figure out what you did to get in
here,” Xor said. “So, why are we here?”</p><p>“We’re looking for information that could help me get home. Maybe we can find a
map or something.”</p><p>“Oh,” said Xor. “I was hoping you were going to say food. Why don’t we
try this place?”</p><p>In front of them was a storefront with a very fancy sign painted on the window:</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00014a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00014"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="figs/web/041fig02.png.jpg"/></div></div><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>Al-go-rith-ms</em></span>. That sounds like a kind of fruit.”</p><p>“Are you <span class="emphasis"><em>always</em></span> hungry, Xor?”</p><p>“Time flies like an arrow, and fruit flies like a banana. Let’s see if
there’s a fruit fly problem I can help them solve.”</p><p>A bell jingled as Laurie opened the door. “Hello, hello!” the shopkeeper said.
“And welcome to my shop. I’m Tinker, and you are looking for a finely crafted algorithm,
am I right?”</p><p>Laurie looked at the items listed on the chalkboard, but they didn’t make any
sense.</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00015a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00015"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="figs/web/042fig01.png.jpg"/></div></div><p>“I’m not sure. What <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> an algorithm? Can you eat it?”
asked Laurie.</p><p>“What? No, it’s just a fancy way of saying ‘how to do something.’ But
<span class="emphasis"><em>Algorithm</em></span> looks more impressive on the sign,” said Tinker.</p><p>Xor turned orange with disappointment.</p><p>“How to do something,” repeated Laurie. “In that case, I want to find a
sensible way to visit every town.”</p><p>“That sounds like an interesting problem. What have you been doing so far?”</p><p>Laurie told Tinker about her adventure in the Red-Black Forest and her visit with Eponymous
Bach.</p><p>“A Hamiltonian path, eh?” said Tinker. “That’s a tough one. I hate to
say it, because he sounds like a nice person, but the Wandering Salesman might take a long, long
time to finish his tour of all the towns.”</p><p>“Oh, no! But why?”</p><p>“If you always go to the nearest town you haven’t visited yet, you might miss a
town that’s just a little farther away. Then you go to another town that’s closer to you
but still farther from the one you missed, and so on. You can end up crisscrossing the whole country
to get to the last few towns.”</p><p>“That sounds exhausting,” said Laurie. The Wandering Salesman wasn’t so
sensible after all! “So how do I find the shortest path?”</p><p>“I’ll see what I have in stock. But it might be expensive.”</p><p>“I don’t have much money with me,” Laurie said. She took a few quarters from
her pocket and showed them to Tinker.</p><p>He looked at them with surprise. “Quarter Dollar? I don’t know what a Dollar is,
never mind a quarter of one. Is this money where you come from?”</p><p>“Of course it’s money! That’s seventy-five cents,” she said.</p><p>“Cents? We use Fair Coins here.”</p><p>“What’s a Fair Coin?”</p><p>“Well, they are a bit bigger than these Quarter Dollars of yours, but not nearly as
pretty! You can tell genuine Fair Coins because they always flip heads or tails,
fifty-fifty.”</p><p>“But you can flip quarters fifty-fifty, too!”</p><p>“That may be true, but I can’t just take <span class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span> word for it,
can I? Here, all Fair Coins must be certified Fair.”</p><p>Laurie was crestfallen.</p><p>“Don’t look so sad! I do want to help you,” said Tinker. “Maybe we can
do a trade. It so happens I’m in the market for a particular algorithm.”</p><p>“But I don’t have any algorithms, either,” said Laurie.</p><p>“That’s not a problem,” said Tinker. “You can compose new ones any
time you want, with a little bit of thinking.”</p><p>“I can? How?”</p><p>“Well, everyone develops their own style. You can put little ideas together to make big
ideas. Or you put two ideas side by side and compare them. Or you start with big ideas and take them
apart.”</p><p>“You mean like Eponymous does?”</p><p>“Yes, just like her. She’s a great Composer.”</p><p>Laurie had never thought that <span class="emphasis"><em>she</em></span> could do things like that herself. But
Tinker seemed to think it was normal.</p><p>“So what do I do?”</p><p>“The algorithm I’m looking for is how to draw a circle,” Tinker said.
“It’s a tough one, so you’ll have to use your imagination. I’ve asked all
the adults and even Ponens and Tollens already, but all they do is mutter about
<span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> squared plus <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> squared and never get
anywhere.”</p><p>“Take a look at this.” He handed Laurie a wind-up toy animal. It had a Shell, and
was Round and Green. “This turtle can do three things: it can move forward or backward, it can
turn, and it can draw a little dot on the paper.”</p><p>“Hey, that’s pretty neat!”</p><p>“Yes, but the thing is, it doesn’t know how to do anything else. That’s
where the algorithm comes in.” Tinker took out a piece of paper and wrote what looked like a
little poem:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Go forward one inch,</p><p>make a mark,</p><p>repeat five times.</p></blockquote></div><p>Then he wound up the turtle and placed it on the poem. It went <span class="emphasis"><em>zzzrbt bzzaap
whuzzzsh</em></span>, and so on. Then it drew a line of dots, just like the poem said:</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00016a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00016"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="figs/web/045fig01.png.jpg"/></div></div><p>“You see? If you put little ideas together, you can make bigger ones,” Tinker
said. “And you can compose <span class="emphasis"><em>those</em></span> ideas into even bigger and bigger
ones.”</p><p>“How do you do that?” asked Laurie.</p><p>“By giving them a name. You can use the name like a handle: you’d carry a pot of
soup by the handle, and you can move around an entire idea just by writing its name. Here,
let’s call the first idea <span class="emphasis"><em>LINE</em></span>. Then you can put four lines together to
make a square.”</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="strong"><strong><span class="green">LINE</span></strong></span>:</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Go forward one inch,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>make a mark,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>repeat five times.</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong><span class="red">SQUARE</span></strong></span>:</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Make a <span class="green">LINE</span>,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Make a right turn,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>repeat four times.</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Make a <span class="red">SQUARE</span>.</strong></span></p></blockquote></div><p>The little turtle <span class="emphasis"><em>zzzrbt</em></span>ed and <span class="emphasis"><em>whuzzzsh</em></span>ed and
<span class="emphasis"><em>bzzaap</em></span>ed, then drew this:</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00017a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00017"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="figs/web/046fig01.png.jpg"/></div></div><p>Laurie was amazed. It was like magic, but every step made sense.</p><p>“So, knowing what the turtle can do, can you teach it how to draw a circle?”
Tinker asked.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Laurie said, “but I want to try!”</p><p>“That’s good enough for me. Here, you can work at my desk. There’s plenty of
paper and compasses and things like that.”</p><p>Laurie sat down at Tinker’s desk. She doodled with the compass and played with the
turtle for a while, trying to remember what she knew about circles.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>A circle is round. No, not just round—perfectly round. You put the pin in the
center, and the pencil spins around. To make a bigger one, you open the compass; to make a smaller
one, you close the compass. If you change the width of the compass when it’s spinning, it
doesn’t make a circle . . .</em></span></p><p>Suddenly an idea, or maybe a memory, popped into her head: <span class="emphasis"><em>a circle is all of the
points that are exactly the same distance from the center. Hmm, what if you . . .</em></span></p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="strong"><strong>Go forward <span class="red">one inch</span>,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>make a mark,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>go back <span class="red">one inch</span>,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>turn right a tiny bit,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>then repeat!</strong></span></p></blockquote></div><p>After Laurie wrote out her poem, she wound up the little turtle again and placed it on the
paper. It buzzed and burbled for a moment, then drew this:</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00018a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00018"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="figs/web/047fig02.png.jpg"/></div></div><p>“It’s working!” she called to Tinker. “Hey, it’s not
stopping.” The turtle was drawing over dots it had already drawn.</p><p>“I think it’s because you told it to repeat, but not how many times,” said
Tinker.</p><p>“Well, it should stop when the circle is done,” Laurie said.</p><p>“It doesn’t really understand circles,” Tinker said. “It’s just
a toy turtle, remember? You have to teach it.”</p><p>Laurie thought a little more, then rewrote her poem:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="strong"><strong><span class="blue">CIRCLE</span>:</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Go forward <span class="red">one inch</span>,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>make a mark,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>go back <span class="red">one inch</span>,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>turn right one degree,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>repeat three hundred sixty times.</strong></span></p></blockquote></div><p>Then she realized that she could make circles of any size she wanted. It was just like opening
the compass wider.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="strong"><strong><span class="blue">TWO-CIRCLE</span>:</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Go forward <span class="red">two
inches</span>,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>make a mark,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>go back <span class="red">two inches</span>,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>turn right one degree,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>repeat three hundred sixty times.</strong></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“This is interesting. You’re working really hard!” Tinker scratched his
head. “But as it is, it’s no good.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“People want to make lots of different circles,” he said. “I’ll have
to keep a lot of algorithms of different sizes, just in case someone wants
three-and-nine-thirteenths inches or four-and-three-quarters inches.”</p><p>“Well, what if you tell the turtle how big to make the circle?” she said.
“Maybe like this.”</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="strong"><strong><span class="blue">ANY-CIRCLE</span> (<span class="red">how-big?</span>):</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Go forward <span class="red">how-big?</span>
inches,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>make a mark,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>go back <span class="red">how-big?</span>
inches,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>turn right one degree,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>repeat three hundred sixty times.</strong></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“And <span class="emphasis"><em>then</em></span>,” she said, “instead of ONE-CIRCLE or
TWO-CIRCLE, you can say ANY-CIRCLE(one), or (two), or even
(one-and-eleventy-sevenths)!”</p><p>“Good idea, Laurie. That’s a lot simpler,” said Tinker. “I was worried
you were going to fill my shop with circles!”</p><p>“You know, the turtle is drawing really slowly. Not like when it was drawing the
square,” she said.</p><p>It was true. The turtle would crawl all the way to the edge of the circle, then make a mark,
then crawl all the way back to the center, 360 times. With small circles it wasn’t too bad,
but big circles took a lot longer.</p><p>“Hmm,” Tinker said. “It spends a <span class="emphasis"><em>lot</em></span> more time running
back and forth than it does making marks. Do you think you can reduce the running
time?”</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>It makes sense, but it isn’t sensible.</em></span> Laurie thought and doodled,
and doodled and thought, but she couldn’t figure out how to make it more sensible. The turtle
has to go back to the center, right? How else could it know where the edge of the circle was?</p><p>Laurie let her eyes wander around the room. Xor was staring at a moth that was flying in lazy
loops around a lightbulb. His skin was slowly fading from red to yellow and back to red. The moth
went around and around. It was hypnotic. Around and around and around and . . .</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Oh! If the moth doesn’t have to go to the center of the lightbulb to fly
around it in a circle, then why does the turtle need to go back to the center to draw
one?</em></span></p><p>Laurie reached for a fresh piece of paper before the idea got away. <span class="emphasis"><em>Don’t let
a new thing out of your sight without a name.</em></span></p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="strong"><strong><span class="blue">MOTH-CIRCLE</span> (<span class="red">how-big?</span>):</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Go forward <span class="red">how-big?</span>
inches,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>make a mark,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>turn right one degree,</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>repeat three hundred sixty times.</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Make a <span class="blue">MOTH-CIRCLE</span> (<span class="red">one</span>).</strong></span></p></blockquote></div><p>The turtle went <span class="emphasis"><em>bzzaap</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>zzzrbt</em></span> and
<span class="emphasis"><em>whuzzzsh</em></span> and then it started to draw. It moved one inch, made a dot, then
turned a tiny bit, then moved one inch, then made another dot . . .</p><p>“Whoops. It’s making a <span class="emphasis"><em>huge</em></span> circle! Let me try a small
number.” Laurie didn’t have a small number handy, so she borrowed one she had heard from
Tortoise: one thirty-second of an inch.</p><p>“That’s better,” Laurie said.</p><p>“Let me see,” Tinker said. “Wow, look at the little guy run!”</p><div class="informalfigure"><a id="med_id00019a"/><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00019"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="figs/web/051fig01.png.jpg"/></div></div><p>“That was fun,” said Laurie. “I didn’t know you could just make up new
ways to do things.”</p><p>“Of course you can. Often you aren’t the first to think of something, but if it
works, who cares? Now, for my end of the trade.”</p><p>“Did you find the shortest path?” Laurie asked.</p><p>“Not exactly. The bad news is that what you are trying to do is
impossible.”</p><p>“It’s impossible?”</p><p>“Well, highly improbable. There are many different ways to visit all the towns. It seems
like you could write an algorithm for the turtle to try each one and find the shortest,
right?”</p><p>“Sure, why not?” said Laurie.</p><p>“There are twenty-one towns in Userland. How many paths do you think there are?”
Tinker said.</p><p>“I don’t know,” said Laurie. “A hundred?”</p><p>“Way more.”</p><p>“Um, a million?” Laurie said.</p><p>“More like a million million times that!” said Tinker.</p><p>“But how can that be?”</p><p>“Let’s say there are only three towns: A, B, and C,” Tinker said. “You
are already standing in A, so you have to worry only about B and C. How many ways can you
go?”</p><p>“Well,” she said, “I could go from B to C, or go to C and then B.
That’s two.”</p><p>“That’s right! But BC is the same as CB, just backward. Every path has a mirror
image, so with three towns there is really only one possible path that visits them all. What if
there were four towns, A, B, C, and D?”</p><p>Laurie counted on her fingers. “I could go BCD, or BDC, or CBD, or CDB, or DCB, or . . .
DBC. Six! No, three.”</p><p>“That’s three times as many. Add another town, and you have twelve times as
many,” Tinker said. “Add a sixth town and there are <span class="emphasis"><em>sixty</em></span> different
paths through all of them. With seven towns there are <span class="emphasis"><em>three hundred sixty
paths</em></span>. As you add more towns, the number of paths gets very big!”</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>3 towns: 2 ÷ 2 = 1</p><p>4 towns: 2 × 3 ÷ 2 = 3</p><p>5 towns: 2 × 3 × 4 ÷ 2 = 12</p><p>6 towns: 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 ÷ 2 = 60</p><p>7 towns: 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 ÷ 2 = 360</p><p>8 towns: 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7 ÷ 2 = 2,520</p><p>9 towns: 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7 × 8 ÷ 2 = 20,160</p></blockquote></div><p>“For twenty-one towns you have to multiply one times two times three times four, all the
way up to twenty. It makes a HUGENORMOUS number!”</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7 × 8 × 9 × 10 × 11 × 12
× 13 × 14 × 15 × 16 × 17 × 18 × 19 × 20 ÷ 2 =</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>1,216,451,004,088,320,000</strong></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“!” said Laurie.</p><p>“Indeed!” Tinker said. “All of that ‘one times two times three’
stuff takes too long to write. So you can use the exclamation point as a shorthand.”</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="strong"><strong>20! ÷ 2 = 1,216,451,004,088,320,000</strong></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“But that’s . . .” Laurie said, counting the commas, “over one million
million <span class="emphasis"><em>million</em></span> paths!”</p><p>“One of those umpty-million paths is the shortest,” Tinker said. “I
don’t know of any way to find it quickly.”</p><p>“I’ll be old before we check them all! Isn’t there a better way to do
it?”</p><p>“Ah, that’s the good news!” Tinker said. “I deal only in Exact
answers. But there is a brilliant Composer who lives in Permute, named Hugh Rustic. He deals in Good
Enough answers. I send him all of my hardest cases. I’ll write an IOU that you can take to
him.”</p></div></body></html>

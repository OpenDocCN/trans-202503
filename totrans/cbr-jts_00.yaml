    often described our mission as “high-speed ninja shit.” That’s when I really started
    noticing the odd prevalence of “ninja” references in cybersecurity. I wanted to
    see if there was anything substantive behind the term’s use. I started researching
    ninjas in 2012, and that’s when I found recent English translations of Japanese
    scrolls written more than 400 years ago (more on those in the “About This Book”
    section that follows). These scrolls were the training manuals that ninjas used
    to learn their craft—not historical reports but the actual playbooks. One of these,
    *Bansenshūkai*, was declassified by the Japanese government and made available
    to the public on a limited basis only after World War II, as the information had
    been considered too dangerous to disseminate for almost 300 years. In medieval
    times, non-ninjas were never supposed to see these documents. Bold warnings in
    the scrolls inform readers to protect the information with their lives. At one
    time, simply possessing such a scroll was enough to merit execution in Japan.
    The taboo nature of the material added an undeniable mystique to the reading experience.
    I was hooked.

    clear that the instructions and secret techniques meant for ninjas were essentially
    on-the-ground training in information assurance, security, infiltration, espionage,
    and destructive attacks that relied on covert access to heavily fortified organizations—many
    of the same concepts I dealt with every day of my career in cybersecurity. These
    400-year-old manuals were filled with insights about defensive and offensive security
    for which I could not find equivalents in modern information assurance practices.
    And because they were field guides that laid bare the tactics, techniques, and
    procedures (TTPs) of secret warfare, they were truly unique. In our business,
    nation-state cyber espionage units and other malicious actors do not hold webinars
    or publish playbooks that describe their TTPs. Thus, these ninja scrolls are singular
    and invaluable.

    just happened. I wrote this book because I believe we have much to learn by taking
    a long view offered in these scrolls of information security’s first advanced
    persistent threat (APT). The information warfare TTPs practiced by ancient ninjas
    were perfected over hundreds of years. The TTPs worked in their time—and they
    could be the key to leapfrogging today’s cybersecurity prevailing models, best
    practices, and concepts to implement more mature and time-tested ideas.'

    at least three baked-in problems. First, even at security organizations, nontechnical
    decision makers or other stakeholders are often excluded from, lied to about,
    or bullied out of cybersecurity conversations because they lack technical expertise.
    Second, many security problems are actually human problems. We already know how
    to implement technical solutions to many threats, but human beings get in the
    way with politics, ignorance, budget concerns, or other constraints. Lastly, the
    availability of security solutions and/or answers that can be purchased or easily
    discovered with internet searches has changed how people approach problems.
  prefs: []

- en: To address these issues, in each chapter, I have presented the central questions
    at the heart of the topic in the Castle Theory Thought Exercise—a mental puzzle
    (which you hopefully can’t google) in which you try to protect your castle (network)
    from the dangers posed by enemy ninjas (cyber threat actors). Framing security
    problems in terms of defending a castle removes the technical aspects of the conversation
    and allows for clearer communication on the crux of the issue and collaboration
    between teams. Everyone can grasp the scenario in which a ninja physically infiltrates
    a castle, whether or not they can speak fluently about enterprise networks and
    hackers. Pretending to be the ruler of a castle also means you can ignore any
    organizational bureaucracy or political problems that come with implementing your
    proposed solutions. After all, kings and queens do what they want.

    attentive and strike where he is negligent.”^([11](b01.xhtml#endnote-11)) So,
    operating as covert agents, they traveled in disguise or by stealth to the target

    from shinobi possess other, undisclosed scrolls that could reveal additional secret
    methods, but their contents have either not been verified by historians or have
    not been made available to the public. The historical texts we do have are key

    (刃) and heart (心). There are various ways to interpret its meaning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a blade. A sword blade is sharp and strong, yet flexible—a tool designed to kill
    humans while also acting as an extension of the user’s spirit and will. This dovetails
    with the Japanese concept of *kokoro*, a combination of one’s heart, spirit, and
    mind into one central essence. In this context, the iconography provides insight
    into the balanced mindset necessary for someone to assume the role of a ninja.

- en: Another interpretation is of a “heart under a blade.” In this reading, the blade
    is an existential threat. It is also not only the physical threat that endangers
    a shinobi’s life but also a weapon that closely guards their beating heart. The
    *onyomi* (Chinese) reading of 忍 is “to persist,” which highlights the inner strength
    needed to work as a spy in enemy territory, under constant threat. The shinobi
    had to perform life-threatening missions that sometimes meant remaining in the
    enemy’s territory for extended periods before acting—that is, being an advanced
    persistent threat.

    to make decisions with “benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and fidelity”^([14](b01.xhtml#endnote-14))
    in mind, even though the result of their craft was often conspiracy and deception.
    This philosophy had the benefit of calming and focusing shinobi during moments
    of intense pressure, such as combat or infiltration. “When you have inner peace,”

    and habits. Before attempting to infiltrate a castle, they first conducted reconnaissance
    to determine the size, location, and function of each room; the access points;
    the inhabitants and their routines; and even their pets’ feeding schedules. They
    memorized the names, titles, and job functions of enemy guards, then used enemy
    flags, crests, and uniforms to sneak in openly (*yo-nin*) while conversing with
    their unsuspecting targets. They collected seals from various lords so they could
    be used in forgeries, often to issue false orders to the enemy’s army. Before
    they engaged in battle, they researched the opposing army’s size, strength, and
    capabilities along with their tendencies in battle, their supply lines, and their
    morale. If their target was a powerful lord, they sought to learn that ruler’s

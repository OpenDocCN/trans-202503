<h3 class="h3" id="lev189"><span class="orange"><strong>INTRODUCING SCRATCH 2</strong></span></h3>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong>NOTE</strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>To find out more about Scratch, visit the official Scratch website at</em> <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">http://scratch.mit.edu/</a>.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Scratch is a visual programming language you can use to create animations, stories, and games using drag-and-drop code blocks. Although Scratch was developed to teach kids how to program, it’s suitable for anyone who wants to learn some fundamental programming concepts or just wants to have fun building their own games.</p>
<p class="indent">Scratch 2 is installed on Raspbian by default. You can open it from the desktop main menu by going to <strong>Programming</strong> <span class="ent">▸</span> <strong>Scratch 2</strong>. When you open Scratch 2, you should see a window like the one in <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19fig1">Figure 19-1</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch19fig1"/><img src="../images/f0234-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 19-1:</strong> The Scratch 2 window</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_235"/>The Scratch window divides the screen into four main sections. The Stage <span class="ent">➊</span> is where your game or animations will play out. At the top right, you’ll see a green flag and a stop sign; you can use these icons to start and stop the game, respectively. When you first open Scratch, you should see a cat on your stage by default.</p>
<p class="indent">The Sprite List <span class="ent">➋</span> shows all of your <em>sprites</em>, which are your game characters or any object that performs an action in your project. In the middle of the window is the Blocks Area <span class="ent">➌</span>, which has three tabs: Scripts, Costumes, and Sounds. The Scripts tab contains programming blocks you use to build your program. Each block is a different programming instruction that you can drag and drop into place in your program. You’ll see different categories of blocks organized according to what they do. Each category has a specific color; for example, blocks from the <strong>Motion</strong> category, which tell your sprites how to move around, are dark blue.</p>
<p class="indent">The Costumes tab <span class="ent">➍</span> shows options for customizing and creating new costumes for your sprites, and the Sounds tab <span class="ent">➎</span> allows you to add sounds to your sprites. The Scripts Area <span class="ent">➏</span> is where you drag the blocks and put them together to create a script.</p>
<p class="indent">The menu bar <span class="ent">➐</span> at the top shows the File and Edit main menus at the left side. The icons at the center allow you to duplicate, delete, grow, and shrink your sprites, and also get help from Scratch.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev190"><span class="orange"><strong>WIRING THE CIRCUIT</strong></span></h3>
<p class="noindent">The circuit for this project consists of two pushbuttons and the Raspberry Pi. Follow these instructions to wire them, using <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19fig2">Figure 19-2</a> as a reference.</p>
<ol>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list">Connect a GND pin to your breadboard’s GND rail.</p></li>

<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 19-2:</strong> Wiring two pushbuttons to the Raspberry Pi</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_236"/>That’s it! You’re ready to code the game.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev191"><span class="orange"><strong>BUILDING THE SCRIPT</strong></span></h3>
<p class="noindent">Before creating a game, it’s useful to outline the features you want your game to have so you know exactly what you need to do.</p>
<p class="indent">In the Hungry Monkey game, the player controls a monkey who needs to catch as many ripe bananas as possible while avoiding rotten bananas. For each good banana caught, the player gets a point; if the player catches a rotten banana, the game deducts a point. Here’s a list of the main steps to build the Hungry Monkey game:</p>
<ol>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list">Create the main character, the monkey, and allow the player to control its movement using two pushbuttons: one moves the monkey right and the other moves the monkey left. Also allow the player to move the monkey with keyboard keys.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list">Create the good and rotten banana sprites and make them fall from the sky.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list">Program the monkey so that it catches the bananas when it touches them.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list">Create a score system that adds one point when the monkey catches a good banana and subtracts a point when it catches a rotten one.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list">Create a timer and end the game when the timer hits 0.</p></li>
<li class="noindent"><p class="list">Display the player’s score when the game is over.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">The Scratch file for this project is available at <em><a href="https://www.nostarch.com/RaspberryPiProject/">https://www.nostarch.com/RaspberryPiProject/</a></em>. To upload a saved program to Scratch, go to <strong>File <span class="ent">▸</span> Load Project</strong>. To build the script, follow the next few sections.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev192"><span class="orange"><strong>Creating the Sprites and Choosing the Stage Background</strong></span></h4>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong>NOTE</strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>You can also create a sprite from scratch using the paintbrush icon, upload your own sprite by clicking the folder icon, or take a photo with a webcam for your sprite with the camera icon.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">In the Hungry Monkey Game, you’ll use a monkey sprite, and a banana sprite from the Sprite Library. You won’t need to use the cat sprite that appears on the Stage by default, so you can delete it by right-clicking the sprite and selecting <strong>Delete</strong> to delete this sprite.</p>
<p class="indent">Go to the Sprite List and click the leftmost icon that looks like a character (see <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19fig3">Figure 19-3</a>) to open the Sprite Library.</p>
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_237"/><a id="ch19fig3"/><img src="../images/f0237-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 19-3:</strong> Icons to create new sprites</p>
<p class="indent">From the Animals category, choose the <code>Monkey2</code> sprite and click <strong>OK</strong>. Then, open the Sprite Library again, select the <code>Bananas</code> sprite from the Things category, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p class="indent">You can choose a background for your game from the leftmost side of the Sprite List. There you’ll find a set of icons for the background. Click the first icon—highlighted in <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19fig4">Figure 19-4</a>—to choose a background from the backdrop library. We’ve chosen the one called <em>blue sky</em>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch19fig4"/><img src="../images/f0237-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 19-4:</strong> Selecting the background from the backdrop library</p>
<p class="indent">Now your sprites section should look like <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19fig5">Figure 19-5</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch19fig5"/><img src="../images/f0237-03.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 19-5:</strong> Sprite List with the selected sprites and background</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev193"><span class="orange"><strong>Editing the Sprites</strong></span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Scratch allows you to increase or decrease the size of a sprite, change its color, or edit it as you would do in an image-editing program. Scratch built-in image editor is called <em>Paint Editor</em>. Here you’ll make some changes to your sprites’ appearance.</p>
<p class="indent">Select the <code>Monkey2</code> sprite in the Sprite List; if a sprite is selected, it will be outlined in blue, as shown in <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19fig5">Figure 19-5</a>. Next, click the <code>Monkey2</code> sprite in the Costumes tab, and edit the first costume, called <code>monkey2-a</code>. With the mouse pointer drag a corner of the sprite until its size matches 98×138 pixels, or use the shrink <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_238"/>tool until you get the desired size; the sprite size is displayed below the <code>monkey2-a</code> costume. Also change the <code>Bananas</code> sprite’s size to 28×28 pixels.</p>
<p class="indent">When adjusting the sprites’ size, make sure they’re at the center of the canvas in order to keep the sprite’s reference point.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev194"><span class="orange"><strong>Adding Controls to the Monkey Sprite</strong></span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ll add controls to the monkey so you can make it go left or right by pressing the pushbuttons or the left and right arrows on the keyboard.</p>
<p class="indent">To allow the Raspberry Pi GPIOs to interface with Scratch so the program will react when a pushbutton is pressed, you need to add an extension library to Scratch. Select the <code>Monkey2</code> sprite in the Scripts tab, select <strong>More Blocks</strong>, and click <strong>Add an Extension</strong>. Next select the Pi GPIO icon, as shown in <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19fig6">Figure 19-6</a>, and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch19fig6"/><img src="../images/f0238-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 19-6:</strong> Adding the Pi GPIO extension</p>
<p class="indent">The extension library adds new blocks to control the Pi GPIOs, which should appear in the More Blocks category.</p>
<p class="indent">There are many different ways to make your sprite move in Scratch. You’ll use the (x,y) coordinate system, in which the (0,0) position is the middle of the Stage. Increasing the x-coordinate moves your sprites to the right, and decreasing it moves your sprites to the left. Increasing the y-coordinate moves your sprites up, and decreasing it moves your sprites down. The blocks that control movement are in the dark blue <strong>Motion</strong> category.</p>
<p class="indent">To control the monkey, select the <code>Monkey2</code> sprite and drag the blocks in <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19fig7">Figure 19-7</a> into the Script Area. Then change the settings in the blocks to match <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19fig7">Figure 19-7</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_239"/><a id="ch19fig7"/><img src="../images/f0239-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 19-7:</strong> Blocks for controlling the monkey</p>
<p class="indent">You first set the <code>Monkey2</code> sprite’s x-position to 0 and y-position to –110. Setting x to 0 centers your sprite horizontally, and setting y to –110 moves your sprite to the floor. This way the sprite is always in this position every time you start the game.</p>
<p class="indent">The next two blocks set GPIO 2 and GPIO 3 to inputs, so the program will be able to tell if the pushbuttons have been pressed.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong>NOTE</strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>Finding the blocks is easy. Remember that each blocks category has a specific color and each block within it is colored accordingly.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Then you add a forever loop that continuously checks if the player is pressing the pushbuttons or the left and right arrow keys. If the player presses the pushbutton connected to GPIO 3, or the right arrow key, the sprite’s x-position is changed by 30, moving it to the right; if the player presses the pushbutton connected to GPIO 2, or the left arrow key, the sprite’s x-position is changed by –30, moving it to the left. You can increase this number to make your monkey move faster, or decrease it to make the monkey move slower.</p>
<p class="indent">Once you’ve added the blocks, double-check them against <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19fig7">Figure 19-7</a>, and then you can test it out.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev195"><span class="orange"><strong>Testing Your Script</strong></span></h4>
<p class="noindent">To start a script in Scratch, you use the green flag block, <img src="../images/f0239-02.jpg" alt="image"/>. This block will start your game and synchronize all the scripts in your sprites. When you click the green flag icon at the top right of the stage section, Scratch starts all the scripts that are under this block.</p>
<p class="indent">Click the green flag icon <img src="../images/f0239-03.jpg" alt="image"/> at the upper-right corner of the stage now. Test that the sprite moves appropriately by pressing the pushbuttons and arrow keys. When you have everything working, move on to the timer.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev196"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_240"/><span class="orange"><strong>Creating the Countdown Timer</strong></span></h4>
<p class="noindent">The player needs to know how much time they have left to catch bananas, so next you’ll create a countdown timer.</p>
<p class="indent">To add the timer to your game, select the <code>Monkey2</code> sprite, and then add the blocks in <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19fig8">Figure 19-8</a> to the Script Area. You may notice you can’t find the <span class="codestrong">show variable</span> block. That’s because you need to create the variable to hold the time. To create variables, navigate to the <strong>Data</strong> blocks category, and click the <strong>Make a Variable</strong> button. Call the new variable <span class="codestrong">time</span> and make it available for all sprites by checking the <strong>For all sprites</strong> box. Now drag that block into the Script Area.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch19fig8"/><img src="../images/f0240-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 19-8:</strong> Blocks to create a countdown timer</p>
<p class="indent">To create the countdown timer, you’ll use a block called <span class="codestrong">timer</span>. This block counts the time that has passed since the script started. When you click the green flag icon, the script resets the timer, so it starts counting from 0 every time you start the game. Next you include a block that shows the <code>time</code> variable on the stage. You can position the <code>time</code> variable by dragging it across the stage section; move it to the stage’s top-right corner.</p>
<p class="indent">Next, the <span class="codestrong">forever</span> loop keeps updating the <code>time</code> variable so that it starts at 30 and decreases by one every second. You use the <span class="codestrong">round</span> block so the countdown time is shown only in integer numbers. If you want to change your game duration, you can adjust the number in the <span class="codestrong">round</span> block.</p>
<p class="indent">Pay careful attention to the nesting here (see <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19fig9">Figure 19-9</a>); you’ll notice that the <span class="codestrong">set time to</span> block comes first, then the <span class="codestrong">round</span> block. Then, on top of that, you need to drop the green <span class="codestrong">-</span> block with two empty circles. Inside the first empty circle, enter <span class="codestrong">30</span>, and inside the second empty circle, drop a <span class="codestrong">timer</span> block from the <strong>Sensing</strong> category.</p>
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_241"/><a id="ch19fig9"/><img src="../images/f0241-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 19-9:</strong> The nested <span class="codestrong">if</span> block</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="codestrong">if</span> block at the end (see <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19fig8">Figure 19-8</a>) hides the <code>time</code> variable from the stage when <code>time</code> hits 0. Now try it out!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev197"><span class="orange"><strong>Counting and Displaying the Score</strong></span></h4>
<p class="noindent">To create the score system, first you need to create a variable to keep track of the score. In the <strong>Data</strong> blocks category, create a new variable called <code>score</code> and make it available for all sprites. Select the <code>Monkey2</code> sprite, and then add the blocks in <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19fig10">Figure 19-10</a> to the scripts area.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch19fig10"/><img src="../images/f0241-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 19-10:</strong> Blocks to display the score and stop the game</p>
<p class="indent">Set the <span class="codestrong">set score to</span> block to <code>0</code> so your score will restart when the game starts. Then add the <span class="codestrong">show variable</span> block to display the score on the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">At the end of the game, when the time hits 0, the monkey should say the score in a speech bubble and all the scripts will stop, ending the game. To make the monkey talk, add some purple <strong>Looks</strong> blocks to show a speech bubble—you can enter whatever text you want your monkey to say here.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, be careful with the nesting here, and look at <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19fig10">Figure 19-10</a> carefully.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev198"><span class="orange"><strong>Making the Bananas Fall from the Sky</strong></span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you’ve created all the <code>Monkey2</code> animations and controls, you need to set the <code>Bananas</code> sprite to fall from the sky. Here’s the to-do list for the <code>Bananas</code> sprite:</p>
<ul>
<li class="noindent">The bananas should fall from the sky, starting from a random x-position and then decreasing in y-position until they hit the floor.</li>
<li class="noindent">The bananas should disappear when they hit the floor.</li>
<li class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_242"/>When the bananas touch the monkey, a sound should play, one point should be added to the score, and the bananas should disappear.</li>
<li class="noindent">All the bananas should be deleted when the time hits 0, so they don’t continue to fall after the game is over.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">First you need to add a sound from the Sound Library to the blocks section.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>Adding a Sound from the Sound Library</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">You’ll add a pop sound to the <code>Bananas</code> sprite to play when it hits the <code>Monkey2</code> sprite. For that, select the <code>Bananas</code> sprite, and in the blocks section select the <strong>Sounds</strong> tab. Then click the <img src="../images/f0242-01.jpg" alt="image"/> icon to choose a sound from the Sound Library and choose <code>pop</code>. Select the <strong>Scripts</strong> tab to add your action blocks.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>Making the Bananas Fall</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">To accomplish everything in the to-do list, select the <code>Bananas</code> sprite, and then add the blocks in <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19fig11">Figure 19-11</a> to its scripts area.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch19fig11"/><img src="../images/f0242-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 19-11:</strong> Blocks for creating and controlling the <code>Bananas</code> sprite</p>
<p class="indent">With the upper-left set of blocks <span class="ent">➊</span> in <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19fig11">Figure 19-11</a>, you create a clone of the <code>Bananas</code> sprite every second. In other words, you make a new <code>Bananas</code> sprite appear every second.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_243"/>In the set of blocks to the right <span class="ent">➌</span>, you initialize the values for the <code>Bananas</code> clones. The <span class="codestrong">show</span> block ensures that the bananas appear on the screen. You set the bananas’ y-position to 170, which corresponds to the top of the Stage, and set the x-position to a random number between –230 and 230, which is the horizontal Stage space from left to right.</p>
<p class="indent">Then you initialize a <span class="codestrong">repeat until</span> block, which is like a <code>while</code> loop that is active until the <code>time</code> variable hits 0. The <span class="codestrong">change y by</span> block inside the <span class="codestrong">repeat until</span> block decreases the y-position of the bananas so they look like they’re falling from the sky. In this case, we’re decreasing the y-position by 5. If you want to make them fall faster, increase the y-value; if you want them to fall more slowly, decrease it.</p>
<p class="indent">The first <span class="codestrong">if</span> block inside the <span class="codestrong">repeat until</span> block makes the bananas disappear when they reach the bottom of the stage, at y &lt; –160. The second <span class="codestrong">if</span> block adds one point to the <code>score</code> variable and plays the <code>pop</code> sound when the bananas hit the monkey, and makes the bananas disappear. Finally, when the <span class="codestrong">repeat until</span> block is over, the <code>Bananas</code> clones are hidden from the stage.</p>
<p class="indent">The blocks in the lower left <span class="ent">➋</span> of <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19fig11">Figure 19-11</a> stop the creation of new <code>Bananas</code> clones when the <code>time</code> variable hits 0.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev199"><span class="orange"><strong>Adding the Rotten Bananas</strong></span></h4>
<p class="noindent">You now have the monkey, the good bananas, the timer, and the score. You’re just missing the rotten bananas. The script for the rotten bananas is really similar to the script in <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19fig11">Figure 19-11</a>; you just need to make these changes:</p>
<ul>
<li class="noindent">Create rotten bananas every 2 seconds instead of 1.</li>
<li class="noindent">Decrease the score by one when the rotten bananas touch the monkey.</li>
<li class="noindent">Play a different sound when the monkey touches the rotten bananas. We’ve chosen the sound called <code>F elec bass</code>.</li>
<li class="noindent">Change how the rotten bananas look.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Because this script is so similar to the previous one, you’re going to duplicate the good bananas and then make the changes. Right-click the <code>Bananas</code> sprite and select <strong>duplicate</strong>. The sprite and its script should be duplicated and automatically named <code>Bananas2</code>. Right-click the <code>Bananas2</code> sprite and select <strong>info</strong>; a menu should <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_244"/>appear that allows you to change the sprite’s name. Enter <code>Rotten</code> as the new name. The changes you need to make to the script are highlighted in <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19fig12">Figure 19-12</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch19fig12"/><img src="../images/f0244-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 19-12:</strong> Blocks for controlling the rotten bananas</p>
<p class="indent">Change the <span class="codestrong">wait</span> block value to <code>2</code> <span class="ent">➊</span>, so a new <code>Rotten</code> clone will fall every 2 seconds, instead of every second. Also change the sound block to play <code>F elec bass</code> <span class="ent">➋</span>, and in the <span class="codestrong">set score to</span> block, reduce the score by <code>1</code> <span class="ent">➌</span>. Remember that you have to add this sound from the library in the Sounds tab first.</p>
<p class="indent">With the script for rotten bananas complete, next you’ll change the <code>Rotten</code> sprite colors so that the bananas look rotten. Select the <code>Rotten</code> sprite and click the <strong>Costumes</strong> tab. The Paint Editor screen should appear (see <a href="ch19.xhtml#ch19fig13">Figure 19-13</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">On the right side of the window, select the bucket icon <span class="ent">➊</span>; then, at the bottom, select different colors <span class="ent">➋</span> to fill each individual banana with a different color. Choose colors like brown, olive green, and dark green to show that they’re rotten.</p>

<p class="noindent">Congratulations! Your game is ready. To play the game in fullscreen, click the fullscreen icon at the top-left corner of the stage, and then click the green flag icon. Playing the game in fullscreen makes it run smoother and quicker.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember that you can use either the pushbuttons or the keyboard keys to play the game. When the game is over, just click the green flag icon to restart.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev201"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_246"/><span class="orange"><strong>TAKING IT FURTHER</strong></span></h3>
<p class="noindent">This project was just a glimpse of what you can do with Scratch. Here are some ideas to improve this game:</p>
<ul>
<li class="noindent">Increase the bananas’ falling speed as the game progresses.</li>
<li class="noindent">Increase the number of rotten bananas as the game progresses.</li>
<li class="noindent">Make this game multiplayer by creating another sprite with different controls. (You’ll need to add another <code>score</code> variable to hold player 2’s score.)</li>
<li class="noindent">Add other electronics to your circuit that you can interface with Scratch, like buttons, buzzers, or sensors.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Have fun and create your own games!</p>

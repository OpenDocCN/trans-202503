    helping your organization prepare for a future cybersecurity incident, perhaps
    through the use of a tabletop exercise. In a *tabletop exercise*, members of an
    organization gather to discuss how they would respond to a potential future event
    or emergency. We’ll dive into the specific characteristics of cybersecurity tabletop
    exercises in more detail in [Chapter 1](chapter1.xhtml), but in brief, most contain
    the following features:'

    as consultants for numerous types of organizations, including nonprofits, manufacturing
    firms, regional banks, utility companies, educational institutions, and governments
    at various levels. In it, you’ll find examples of tabletop exercises suited to
    different purposes, as well as detailed guidance on how to plan, facilitate, and
    learn from them. The considerations we discuss herein should help you make your
    tabletop exercise process smoother and deliver the greatest benefit to your organization.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book has several audiences in mind. The first is information security professionals
    and those in related roles who are tasked with creating and facilitating a tabletop
    exercise for their employer. These individuals might need help executing their
    organization’s first tabletop exercise, or they might want to improve their performance
    in an ongoing series of exercises. Moreover, the people tasked with developing
    these exercises most likely have other job responsibilities, so in many organizations,
    it is difficult to perform a tabletop exercise more than once a year, and those
    overseeing them may have little opportunity to become experts in the topic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also target information security consultants who serve as external resources
    for other organizations seeking to perform a tabletop exercise. Companies that
    provide information security services frequently receive requests for help creating
    and facilitating a tabletop exercise. Given our extensive background in information
    security consulting, we would be remiss if we didn’t include the lessons we’ve
    learned from the consulting side.

    you could adapt much of the process we discuss to other facets of the organization.
    Non–information security exercises might evaluate the organization’s readiness
    for business continuity issues (such as the impact of a sustained power outage
    at an assisted care facility) or physical security events, for example.

    sample exercise scenarios that you could leverage for your own events, along with
    suggestions for adapting them.

    you’ll need to create the business case for performing a tabletop exercise, and
    this chapter will help bolster your argument. We’ll explore how tabletop exercises
    can help an organization align with standards, practice for the inevitable bad
    day, evaluate the policy implications of a cybersecurity incident, examine technical
    controls, and identify process deficiencies.'

    observations that were uncovered. Throughout the book, you’ll find case studies
    discussing tabletops that went according to plan—and, occasionally, ones that
    went awry. We’ve included these examples so that you can learn from the efforts
    of others. While we’ve fictionalized these stories and the names of the organizations
    involved, the events are based on actual engagements we’ve undertaken in our careers.

- en: The security community widely considers tabletop exercises a necessity to reduce
    the risks an organization faces. For this reason, many authorities—including the
    US Department of Homeland Security, the International Organization for Standardization,
    the French National Agency for the Security of Information Systems, and the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology—have released guidelines on preparing for
    disasters using tabletop exercises.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These agencies have similar definitions and processes for performing security
    exercises. For consistency, however, this book uses those created by the United
    States’ Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program (HSEEP), which defines
    an exercise as “an event or activity, delivered through discussion or action,
    to develop, assess, or validate plans, policies, procedures, and capabilities
    that jurisdictions/organizations can use to achieve planned outcomes.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A subset of the previously defined exercise includes discussion-based exercises,
    which would include tabletop exercises, as well as seminars, workshops, and games.
    According to HSEEP, discussion-based exercises tend to include teams new to incident
    response, or teams that want to become acquainted with new plans, procedures,
    or other team members. Nevertheless, mature teams should not discount the value
    of discussion-based exercises. These exercises are usually led by facilitators
    and constrained by a shorter execution window (for example, two hours). While
    HSEEP states that discussion-based exercises tend to focus on “strategic, policy-oriented”
    issues, they can just as easily include technical discussions.

    in North America and Europe. As a result, the standards and practices we discuss
    come from agencies in these regions. If you’re performing tabletop exercises elsewhere,
    consider the advice of the industry authorities in your area to supplement the
    discussions in this book.'

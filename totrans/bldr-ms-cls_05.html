In this chapter, you’ll learn how to flesh out this framework to create finished models.</p><p>To create the final models, we need to transform our simple geometry using a mix of techniques. These techniques include using modifiers to add procedural details as well as modeling elements by hand. Our aim should be to end up with clean, well-modeled, detailed meshes, without overcomplicating things or introducing unhelpful geometry that could slow down renders or create artifacts.</p><p>Modeling details is great fun, but it can also be quite repetitive, so I won’t exhaustively cover the process of making every part. Instead, I’ll focus on key aspects of creating certain elements of projects that are the most interesting or tricky and leave the rest to your imagination. We’ll begin with some discussion of topology, discuss what constitutes a “good” mesh, and then move on to the actual modeling.</p><div class="sect1" title="Topology"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="topology">Topology</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Topology</em></span> describes the way that the edges and faces of a mesh connect and flow across its surface. We covered the basics of topology when creating the base meshes for sculpting the Bat Creature and Spider Bot—namely, creating even loops of vertices around the arms and legs and avoiding triangular faces. Now let’s talk about why we do things this way.</p><p>There are many ways to create meshes that have the same basic shapes but use very different configurations of faces in their construction, as you can see in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#same_head_shape_with_three_very_differen" title="Figure 5-1. The same head shape with three very different meshes">Figure 5-1</a>.</p><p>While the shapes in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#same_head_shape_with_three_very_differen" title="Figure 5-1. The same head shape with three very different meshes">Figure 5-1</a> are roughly the same, the middle mesh is the most useful because its geometry flows with the form of the face, creating loops around the eyes and the mouth and running neatly down the neck and over the head. Also, it describes the forms of the head just as well as (or better than) the other meshes, while using fewer faces.</p><p>The flowing characteristics of this mesh are also important for animation because they allow the mesh to deform easily and smoothly. For example, <a id="iddle1234" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1911" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1931" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2092" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2443" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2575" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2577" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2595" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2598" class="indexterm"/>closing the eyes or opening the mouth won’t stretch edges awkwardly or cause parts of the mesh to intersect unpleasantly. This kind of loop-based topology also helps when creating further variations on the shape, and it makes it easier to place UV seams and to UV unwrap the mesh without too much stretching (see <a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. UV Unwrapping">Chapter 8</a> for more on unwrapping).</p><div class="figure"><a id="same_head_shape_with_three_very_differen"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00068"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538378.png.jpg" alt="The same head shape with three very different meshes"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 5-1. The same head shape with three very different meshes</div></div><p>Another reason that the middle mesh in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#same_head_shape_with_three_very_differen" title="Figure 5-1. The same head shape with three very different meshes">Figure 5-1</a> is the better choice is that its topology is the best suited for use with the <span class="emphasis"><em>Subdivision Surface (Subsurf) modifier</em></span>. The Subdivision Surface modifier, which we covered in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Blocking In">Chapter 4</a>, is used to subdivide and smooth a mesh. The algorithm used by the Subdivision Surface modifier, Catmull-Clark subdivision, works best when given a mesh constructed like this one. When the Subdivision Surface modifier is used with a mesh containing a lot of triangles or long, oddly shaped faces, it can give poor results, but when given well-constructed, flowing topology, it produces very predictable, smooth forms.</p><div class="sect2" title="What Is Good Topology?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="what_is_good_topologyquestion_mark">What Is Good Topology?</h3></div></div></div><p>Good topology for animation is usually good for subdivision and vice versa. But what constitutes good topology? While there are no absolute rules, there are a few important principles. It’s a mix of art and science.</p><p title="Avoid triangles and n-gons where possible."><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Avoid triangles and <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>-gons where possible.</strong></span></strong></span> This is the big one. While triangles are fine in a static mesh that you don’t intend to subdivide or in a low-poly object for a game, if you plan to subdivide your mesh, use as few triangles as possible because triangles don’t subdivide as well as quads. Equally, <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>-gons are converted to triangles before being subdivided, resulting in the same kinds of problems.</p><p title="Avoid poles with lots of edges."><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Avoid poles with lots of edges.</strong></span></strong></span> A <span class="emphasis"><em>pole</em></span> is a vertex where three, five, or more edges meet—that is, a point in a mesh that deviates from a grid-like structure. Like triangles, poles can create artifacts when subdividing a mesh. Poles with three or five edges aren’t so bad—indeed, it’s just about impossible to create anything but toroids and grids without creating a few poles—but poles with six or more edges subdivide poorly.</p><p title="Create loops around important forms."><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Create loops around important forms.</strong></span></strong></span> This allows you to easily select, deform, and animate your meshes, and it also ensures they will subdivide cleanly. For example, in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#same_head_shape_with_three_very_differen" title="Figure 5-1. The same head shape with three very different meshes">Figure 5-1</a>, the use of edge loops that flow around the eyes makes it easier to adjust their shape.</p><p title="Align edges with the form."><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Align edges with the form.</strong></span></strong></span> If your object is roughly cylindrical, the edges of the mesh should flow around its circumference and along its length. If your object is roughly cuboidal, create it by starting from a cube and adding loop cuts. In general, try to create a mesh structure that goes with the “grain” of the shape you are trying to create, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#topology_dos_and_donapostrophets_avoid_t" title="Figure 5-2. Topology dos and don’ts: Avoid triangles 1, avoid poles 2, create loops around important forms 3, and align edges with the forms, not against them 4.">Figure 5-2</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Dealing with Difficult Topology"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="dealing_with_difficult_topology">Dealing with Difficult Topology</h3></div></div></div><p>The rules listed above are simple, but you may run into trouble following them from time to time, especially when trying to eliminate triangles and poles from your models. Here are some tips for dealing with difficult topology:</p><p title="Plan ahead."><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Plan ahead.</strong></span></strong></span> Most topology woes can be sidestepped simply by planning ahead. That’s why, for example, we made sure there were eight vertices in the loops around the arms and legs when creating the base mesh for the Bat Creature: It made joining the hands easy, as there were no surplus edges to join together when it came to bridging the gap. Powers of 2 (8, 16, or 32) are often a good way to think about this, but regardless, try to keep to even numbers when creating edge loops. If you are new to 3D modeling, it can be helpful to sketch your desired mesh over a photo or your concept art, either in GIMP or on paper, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#sketching_your_topology_beforehand_can_h" title="Figure 5-3. Sketching your topology beforehand can help you avoid difficulties.">Figure 5-3</a>.</p><p title="Two tris make a quad."><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Two tris make a quad.</strong></span></strong></span> You can join two adjacent triangles to make a quad, killing two birds with one stone.

If the new edge loop terminates at an open edge, you’ve eliminated your triangle. If your mesh is closed, it might just move the triangle to the other end of the edge loop, and, if you have triangles at both ends, you can take out two at a time (see <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#adding_edge_loops_with_the_loop_cut_tool" title="Figure 5-5. Adding edge loops with the Loop Cut tool (CTRL-R) can get rid of triangles.

Beginning with the bottom row, I added each one by hand and modified its length to give some variation. Next, I built up the higher layers by duplicating and scaling the cubes. To add further variety, I selected blocks at random, moved them in or out from the wall a bit, and rotated them slightly to make the surface of the wall somewhat more uneven. Leaving the basic walls from the blocking-in stage behind the new blocks provided a filler for the gaps between the blocks.</p><p>To add a beveled edge to the blocks (see <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#creating_the_stone_blocks_for_the_wallsd" title="Figure 5-8. Creating the stone blocks for the walls.

Because the mesh won’t be subdivided or deformed significantly, there’s no need to avoid triangles here; they won’t cause problems.</p><p>To prevent the blocks from looking faceted, I set their shading mode to Smooth and then added an Edge Split modifier to split the mesh at certain edges in order to produce separate surfaces (see <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#final_wallscomma_with_a_bevel_and_an_edg" title="Figure 5-9. The final walls, with a Bevel and an Edge Split modifier to give them beveled edges and flat sides">Figure 5-9</a>).

Support loops work by placing two or more edge loops close together at the edge of a form. When the mesh is subdivided, the new geometry can’t be smoothed out as much because the extra geometry defines the corner more tightly (see <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#two_methods_of_getting_sharp_edges_when" title="Figure 5-14. Two methods of getting sharp edges when working with a subdivision surface. Top: Unaltered mesh with a gentle slope and a Subdivision Surface modifier applied. Middle: Support loops added to give sharp edges. Bottom: Edges creased to give sharp edges (without extra geometry).">Figure 5-14</a>).</p><p>Both methods have their place. Support loops are the better choice when you’re trying to produce nicely beveled edges and need fine control over precisely how your forms look. However, if your goal is to produce very sharp creases or you are working with simpler models with less extra topology, creasing is preferable. You can always mix and match both methods as the situation demands.</p><p>Support loops are also useful for ensuring that objects subdivide to give the shapes you want. For example, <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#clockwise_from_top_left_a_cube_with_zero" title="Figure 5-15. Clockwise from top left: A cube with zero loops, one loop, two widely spaced loops, and two evenly spaced loops running around the middle of each side. As the edge loops get closer to the edge, the corners become more sharply defined.">Figure 5-15</a> shows a cube with a Subsurf modifier applied and its wireframe visible. With no support loops, the modifier turns it into a sphere. With extra support loops running around the middle of the faces, the object more closely resembles a cube, and shifting these support loops toward the edges of the cube makes the corners sharper. This is useful when modeling all sorts of surfaces.</p><div class="figure"><a id="using_the_array_modifier_to_repeat_the_s"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00080"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538402.png.jpg" alt="Using the Array modifier to repeat the stone carvings multiple times"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 5-13. Using the Array modifier to repeat the stone carvings multiple times</div></div><div class="figure"><a id="two_methods_of_getting_sharp_edges_when"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00081"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538404.png.jpg" alt="Two methods of getting sharp edges when working with a subdivision surface.

To create them, I began by modeling a few varieties of leaves from planes; I scaled and subdivided the planes into leafy shapes (see <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#plants_were_all_made_with_very_simple_me" title="Figure 5-16. The plants were all made with very simple meshes (shown with a Subdivision Surface modifier applied).">Figure 5-16</a>). Next, I started duplicating these different leaf objects and placing them around the scene. By creating linked duplicates with <span class="smaller">ALT</span>-D, you can create multiple copies of the same mesh that all update together when you change one duplicate, which makes creating UVs and textures much easier because you only have to do so once for each type of plant. By scaling and rotating these duplicates in Object mode and placing them around the scene, you can give the impression of a lot of variation without having to create a lot of different meshes (see <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#duplicating_the_different_plant_componen" title="Figure 5-17. Duplicating the different plant components and placing them around the scene. Varying the scale and rotation of the duplicates can go a long way toward making them distinctive.">Figure 5-17</a>).</p><p>There are two ways to duplicate a mesh in Object mode. One way is to create a simple copy, which then becomes a unique object (<span class="smaller">SHIFT</span>-D); the other is to duplicate a linked copy (<span class="smaller">ALT</span>-D), which retains the same mesh data and materials as the original and updates along with it. You can still apply different modifiers to a linked duplicate and move, scale, and rotate it independently in Object mode, but its mesh data and materials, as well as other data, will remain linked with the original object; if you edit one, the changes are applied to both.</p><p>Both methods are extremely useful for different tasks.

To do so, select all of the objects you want the ivy to cover, duplicate them (<span class="smaller">SHIFT</span>-D), apply any modifiers (using the <span class="strong"><strong>Convert to Mesh</strong></span> operator in Object mode—<span class="smaller">ALT</span>-C), and merge them into one object (<span class="smaller">CTRL</span>-J). The result should be one object. If your scene has a high poly count, you might want to skip applying modifiers that increase the poly count a lot in order to give you a lower-poly mesh to grow ivy over; unfortunately, this may come at the cost of some accuracy in how it will grow.</p><p>Later, once you’ve finished growing your ivy, delete this duplicate or move it to another layer so that it doesn’t get in your way (<span class="strong"><strong>M</strong></span>).</p><p>Next, place the 3D cursor where you want the ivy to start and activate IvyGen with the Add Curve menu (<span class="smaller">SHIFT</span>-A▸<span class="strong"><strong>Add Curve</strong></span>▸<span class="strong"><strong>Add Ivy To Mesh</strong></span>). The IvyGen allows you to tweak numerous parameters to determine how the ivy looks, the most important of which are the Max Ivy Length option, which determines how far the ivy spreads, and the Ivy Size and Leaf Size options, which determine the thickness of the vines and the size of the leaves. The leaf probability option determines the leaf density. Other options, like Float Length and Adhesion Length, determine how far the vines can reach out from the wall and how they are affected by gravity.</p><p>Keep tweaking IvyGen’s settings and pressing <span class="strong"><strong>Update Ivy</strong></span> to regenerate your ivy with any new settings until you’re happy with the look of your foliage. Keep in mind that the higher you set the Max Ivy Length, the longer the ivy will take to generate. Also, if you want to cover a large area, it’s easier to run IvyGen repeatedly using different starting locations in order to create multiple ivy meshes. For example, in the Jungle Temple scene, I hid the starting locations in the corners of the scene in a couple of different starting locations and let my ivy grow out from there.

Next, I added a new plane (this time keeping it unsubdivided and perfectly flat) and placed it just below the average height of the ground so that some of the deeper areas poked down through it. This produces the effect of puddles on the ground (see <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#adding_puddles_to_the_scene_by_first_cre" title="Figure 5-20. Adding puddles to the scene by first creating depressions in the main ground plane mesh and then adding a second flat plane to intersect with it">Figure 5-20</a>).</p><p>Additionally, I created piles of dirt in the corners of the scene simply by creating a plane, subdividing it several times, and using proportional editing to add lumps.

The fangs are simply cubes, extruded and with loop cuts added to make constrictions where they bend. I added some further embellishments using a mix of Blender’s modeling tools and retopology techniques.

As these wouldn’t be sculpted or retopologized in any way, I aimed straight for the final mesh.</p><div class="sect2" title="Eyes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="eyes">Eyes</h3></div></div></div><p>There are many ways to model eyes, but in general it helps to model some of the internal structure of the eye first to allow the rendered eye to catch light and reflections realistically. My model for the eye (see <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#modeling_the_eyedot_left_the_outer_layer" title="Figure 5-28. Modeling the eye. Left: The outer layer. Note the grid topology at the end of the cornea. Middle: The inner layer. Right: The two combined in wireframe view, shown from the side.">Figure 5-28</a>) consisted of an outer layer, which will have a transparent material and which makes up the cornea and the reflective surface of the eye, and an inner layer, which will later be textured with the pupil, iris, and sclera (the white of the eye).</p><p>Both the inner and outer layers are made in the same way, beginning with a UV sphere (in Object mode <span class="smaller">SHIFT</span>-A▸Mesh▸UVSphere) and then using proportional edit to push in the end of the sphere for the inner part or to push it out a little for the outer part to add a bulge to the cornea. For the inner part, after pushing the surface in with proportional editing, I extruded back the most central faces to create a pit for the pupil. For the cornea, I deleted the end triangular faces of the UV sphere and replaced them with a subdivided plane to avoid artifacts when a Subdivision Surface modifier is added (see the left of <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#creating_the_couplingdot_i_converted_the" title="Figure 5-27. Creating the coupling.

Using the To Sphere operator (<span class="smaller">ALT-SHIFT</span>-S) can help you regain the spherical shape of the eye after adjusting its topology.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Teeth and Nails"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="teeth_and_nails">Teeth and Nails</h3></div></div></div><p>Both the teeth and nails were derived from cubes (see <a class="xref" href="ch05.html#modeling_the_teeth_and_nails" title="Figure 5-29. Modeling the teeth and nails">Figure 5-29</a>). To create the teeth, I began with a cube, scaled it down, and extruded from the bottom. By repeatedly scaling down the bottom of the tooth and then extruding again, I was able to refine the tooth into a point. I then positioned and duplicated the teeth and used a Mirror modifier to fill in the other side of the mouth.</p><p>For the nails, I flattened the cube a bit, added a loop cut down the middle, and moved it out a little to give the nail a bit of a curve. I then repeated the same process I had used for the teeth, refining them into a point and then placing them by hand and duplicating as many as I needed.</p><div class="figure"><a id="modeling_the_eyedot_left_the_outer_layer"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00095"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538432.png.jpg" alt="Modeling the eye.

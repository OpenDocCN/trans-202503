			<p class="ChapterIntro">Many families spend a good portion of the day away from each other—perhaps with kids shipped off to school and one or both parents at work. If anything unsettling happens during that time, the universal instinct is to grab a cell phone, check in on each other, and decide what to do. But if at that very moment, all your cell phone can muster is “no service” or “call failed,” you might find yourself in a tough spot. After all, we no longer have phone booths on every corner, and most homes don’t have a landline to try.</p>
			<p>
				There’s no doubt that wireless telecommunications infrastructure is prone to disruption too. The simplest observation is that a typical cell tower can handle a fairly modest number of concurrent transmissions, far fewer than there are handsets in range. It follows that in the wake of major terror <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_182" title="182"/>attacks or other high-profile calamities that prompt everyone to check in on their loved ones, the networks inevitably get overloaded and croak. Such problems can persist for hours. Worse yet, power outages, earthquakes, and hurricanes can take the local communications backbone offline for days, until physical repairs are made.</p>
			<p>The consequences of losing communications aren’t particularly serious when all family members can travel on their own and safely make it back home. At worst, some anxious thumb-twiddling lies ahead. But more gut-wrenching outcomes are possible: imagine a natural disaster that has two parents racing to pick up a young kid from a distant school, only to get stuck in traffic for hours because of road closures and detours. When they finally arrive at their destination, they find the classroom vacant amid chaos, suggesting the kid must’ve left with somebody else—or perhaps wandered off. Scenarios like this are why having some form of backup communications isn’t just a luxury, but can be a very real need.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c22-0001">The Lost Art of Pen and Paper</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">When contemplating emergency communications schemes, we tend to gravitate toward high-tech solutions: two-way radios, satellite phones, or experimental technologies such as goTenna, a peer-to-peer mesh networking platform marketed by a startup based in New York. Alas, most of these approaches aren’t nearly as versatile as they may seem. Handheld radios suffer from abysmal range in densely populated cities; satellite technology can be prohibitively expensive; and mesh networking isn’t popular enough to work reliably in most communities under normal circumstances, let alone when the power goes out.</p>
			<p>Given these obstacles, instead of trying to replicate the convenience of instantaneous communications, it may be better to develop a strategy that helps your family collect its bearings without immediately touching base. For a young child, this plan could involve telling them where and for how long to wait for pickup, and then where to seek shelter after dark. For adolescents and adults, the plan may consist of a prioritized list of meeting points—such as a friend’s place or a nearby motel—along with suggestions about how long to wait at each location and where to leave a note if you need to hit the road again. Because such instructions are hard to recall, it’s best to print them on a laminated card, and then make sure that every household member carries it in their wallet, backpack, or purse. Adding paper and writing implements is important too.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c22-0002">Satellite Communications</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">After pen and paper, satellite communications are probably the most dependable way of staying in touch—and indeed, the technology is commonly relied on by those responding to natural disasters or traveling to the farthest reaches of the world. That said, satellite <em>phones</em> aren’t a good choice for most preppers, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_183" title="183"/>simply because the devices and the plans are expensive. The unit itself costs around $1,000, and the subscription adds about $70 a month—and most families would need at least a pair. Battery life is fairly poor as well, usually lasting only about two to three days on standby before needing a boost.</p>
			<p>
				A better alternative are satellite <em>messengers</em>, sold by Garmin under the brand inReach. The basic inReach SE+ device operates on the global Iridium network and costs around $400. The monthly subscription is about $12, making it a far more sensible expense, especially for those who also occasionally go on hikes or travel through rural areas with no cell phone coverage. The battery in these units lasts up to several weeks on standby, and around three years in storage, so recharging isn’t an immediate need.</p>
			<p>Satellite messengers allow two-way communications similar to mobile texting, although the latency is considerably higher, around five minutes or so. Messages can be delivered to other inReach devices, to email addresses, or to regular phones outside the outage area; GPS coordinates of the sender are included too. It’s also possible to request emergency help from the authorities, which may not accomplish much in a large-scale disaster, but could prove invaluable when injured or lost on a remote hike.</p>
			<p>Some aspects of the messaging service depend on terrestrial infrastructure; the satellites merely relay the signal between the subscriber and the hub. After some sleuthing, I believe that the primary Iridium communications gateway is located in Tempe, Arizona, while their satellite control facility is in Leesburg, Virginia. The location of Garmin inReach servers is more difficult to divine because of the way they’re set up, but the company does have some data-center technician jobs in Olathe, Kansas. Several of their other job listings also mention Azure, a cloud-based environment run by Microsoft; the Azure data center nearest to Garmin headquarters is in West Des Moines, Iowa, so it could be a natural pick. While making definite pronouncements is hard without insider knowledge about how these companies operate, I’d wager that unless a regional disaster occurs in one of the aforementioned locations, your inReach has a good chance of working just fine.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c22-0003">Two-Way Radios</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Two-way radios are sort of like bulletproof vests: weirdly difficult to resist for any techie, yet of very little use to most. To be fair, handheld radios <em>are</em> more practical than Kevlar. It’s just that neither of these tools works as neatly as we imagine they would.</p>
			<p>In the event of a prolonged power outage, handheld radios can be a wonderful way to connect with friends or relatives who live nearby or to stay in touch with family members running errands close to home. But they’re severely constrained by their range. In high-rise environments, direct handheld-to-handheld communications are possible within perhaps two to five blocks; in densely populated suburbs, you seldom get more than a mile. There are ways to extend the coverage—we’ll talk about them a bit later—but they all come at a cost.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_184" title="184"/>Staying apprised of emergencies by listening to first responders with low-cost handhelds is tough too. Many urban and suburban agencies have moved onto frequency-hopping digital radio systems, and a growing percentage of the traffic is encrypted to keep nosy peasants out. A dedicated $500 scanner from Uniden may be able to follow the unencrypted traffic, but all you’re going to hear on a low-cost BaoFeng radio are angry modem noises, and perhaps bits and pieces of conversations every now and then. Older, single-frequency systems may still be in use in your region—for example, the California Highway Patrol still relies on old-school FM—but I wouldn’t expect this to last. The chatter on amateur frequencies can be more accessible but is seldom particularly worthwhile. In a major disaster, most strangers won’t be able or inclined to help, and the airwaves turn into rumor mills not different from what you often see on Facebook or Nextdoor—except with no way to quickly fact-check the claims. In the end, for almost all intents and purposes, a battery-operated AM/FM radio receiver that lets you receive official broadcasts may offer more bang for your buck.</p>
			<p>If you’re still interested in two-way radio communications, ask yourself if you and your potential contacts have a genuine interest in mastering the craft. Especially for licensed amateur radio bands, the radios can be finicky and there’s a fairly steep learning curve, so it probably isn’t realistic to just buy a pair of handhelds, stow them away, and hope for the best.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-502123c22-0001">Understanding the Range of Handhelds</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">The manufacturers of two-way radios are notorious for making extraordinary claims about the capabilities of their products, but in urban high-rise environments, the range of handheld radios is modest. Vertically, you might be able to clear anywhere from 5 to 20 floors in a building; horizontally, as noted earlier, you can typically get two to five city blocks if you’re standing on the street. In suburban areas, the outlook is a bit better. Direct handheld-to-handheld communications are typically feasible within a mile, depending on housing density and terrain (hills and commercial buildings can get in the way). Finally, in sparsely populated rural regions, a range of three to four miles is usually attainable—although again, this can be less if the circumstances aren’t right.</p>
			<p>Newcomers to radio communications often assume that the range of their gadgets can be significantly extended by cranking up the transmit power or installing a larger antenna, but for handhelds, the upper limit is a matter of basic physics. The problem is simple: for the most part, radio waves propagate in straight lines. The usual distance to the horizon from the vantage point of a person of average height is around three miles; past that point, the scenery ends up in the largely impenetrable radio shadow of the planet we call Earth.</p>
			<p>
				Of course, in urban and suburban environments, the horizon isn’t your only worry. The signal from your radio is attenuated every time it has to cross through drywall or masonry, but more important, the longer it has to travel, the more likely it is to eventually encounter a far less permeable obstacle—say, a metal garage door or a major appliance in somebody else’s <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_185" title="185"/>home. There’s also the ever-growing chance that the increasingly faint transmission will be drowned out by a source of interference closer to the recipient; motors, light dimmers, motion sensors, fluorescent and LED fixtures, TVs, computers, and car ignition systems are just some of the things to worry about.</p>
			<p>In other words, while transmit power or antenna choice can make a difference, the payoff tends to be disappointing; for example, switching from a 2-watt (W) handheld to a 5 W one is unlikely to increase your range in the suburbs by more than 30 percent, and going from 5 W to 8 W is just a way to more quickly discharge your battery.</p>
			<p>
				What <em>does</em> work for extending the range of a radio is getting to a higher vantage point. When you do this, your horizon moves farther away: you can see almost 7 miles out by the time you climb to 30 feet. Just as important, the straight-line propagation path between you and other people no longer hugs the ground, so the signal travels mostly through free space, avoiding many of the low obstacles along the way.</p>
			<p>For extending your range in this fashion, sometimes nature does all the hard work. If your home is perched on a hill that overlooks a rural valley, you might be able to communicate across vast distances without breaking a sweat. For everybody else, the simplest way to gain ground may be to climb to the top of a parking structure or tall building. The solution isn’t always convenient or practical, but it’s a solid life hack if other methods fail. Another approach is to erect a base station at home, mounting an antenna on a tall pole or on your roof; that said, this solution isn’t always compatible with apartment living or with HOAs from hell.</p>
			<p>
				A natural extension of transmitting from a higher vantage point is to use a specialized relay, also known as a <em>repeater</em>. Repeaters are present in most populated areas in the United States (see <a class="LinkURL" href="https://repeaterbook.com/repeaters/">https://repeaterbook.com/repeaters/</a>) and are often installed on mountaintops or on tall buildings. The repeater simply listens to traffic on its input frequency and then broadcasts it on an output frequency. Because the path from your handheld to the repeater (and vice versa) doesn’t hug the ground, the reach of two street-level handhelds communicating through a repeater can increase tenfold or more. On the flip side, repeaters can be damaged by storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, and so on, and while some have emergency power, others don’t. In other words, a repeater adds new failure modes to your plan.</p>
			<p>When transmitting from high ground or using a base station or repeater, the practical upper limit to your range probably peaks at around 20 to 30 miles in densely populated areas, or 40 to 60 miles in rural valleys. More might be sporadically possible, and sometimes you can find a network of linked repeaters that can carry your voice 200 miles or more—but such systems are few and far between.</p>
			<p>In the absence of dependable long-distance comms, manually relayed radio messages can be a work-around. If you befriend other operators in your vicinity, they may be willing to retransmit information on your behalf, helping you reach faraway places in a couple of hops. The odds of pulling that off increase if you learn your radio, find out where the regulars meet, and master the on-air etiquette beforehand.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-502123c22-0002"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_186" title="186"/>Radio Bands and Types of Service</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Any person looking to acquire a two-way radio will have to choose between a variety of bands and services. There’s CB, GMRS, FRS, MURS, ham radio, and more—each designated its own portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, and each governed by its own rules. Some of these options work well for emergency preparedness; others can derail an otherwise sound survival plan.</p>
			<p>For handhelds, the frequency the radio operates on has relatively little impact on its range and reliability. It’s true that different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum have very different propagation characteristics: Wi-Fi signals pass through drywall, visible light shines through glass, and far infrared can travel unimpeded through a metallic germanium lens. Similarly, on some radio frequencies, signals can pass through oceans or bounce off the ionosphere and reach faraway lands, while on other wavelengths, line-of-sight propagation reigns supreme, and a little bit of rain can get in the way. But while this may point to the importance of choosing the right wavelength for the task at hand, virtually all the frequencies that offer beyond-horizon signal propagation require bulky antennas that can’t realistically be mounted on a handheld device.</p>
			<p>In practice, modern handhelds usually operate in two short-range frequency bands: the 144 MHz band (aka 2m) and 420/430 MHz (70cm); you can also sometimes bump into 222 MHz (1.25m), but it’s comparatively rare. All these frequencies behave fairly similarly; a little bit of range may be gained with 2m compared to 70cm in rural settings, but the differences are small. What matters more is the exact type of radio service you pick. Depending on the device you purchase and the licensing you secure, you might have different privileges and different types of radio infrastructure at your disposal in the time of need.</p>
			<p>
				The first service worth mentioning is <em>citizens band (CB)</em> radio, an ancient but well-known band available to the general public. In the United States, transmitting here doesn’t require an explicit license, outside of the manufacturer’s certification for the transceiver itself. Operators are limited to 4 W, with no repeaters allowed. CB uses 40 designated channels centered around 27 MHz; astute readers will note that this is well below the common frequencies used by handheld radios today. The low frequency theoretically offers better propagation, but also means that most CB handhelds with small antennas won’t be transmitting efficiently. The technology is much better suited for vehicles and homes, and the handhelds are just a poorly performing afterthought.</p>
			<p>In any case, once popular in all kinds of settings, CB is now mostly extinct, except for some long-haul truckers, who use it as a sort of roadside chat room. A distinctive culture surrounds CB, with its own lingo and a set of recurring conversation topics. If you call for help on these frequencies near a major road, you’ll probably get help; but beyond that, it’s not an environment to everybody’s liking and probably not a service to embrace.</p>
			<p>
				Another class of radios that require no special licensing is <em>Family Radio Service (FRS)</em>. The equipment operates on a set of 22 designated channels <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_187" title="187"/>between 462 and 467 MHz, with a power limit of 2 W. Many of the cheapest “blister pack” walkie-talkies are FRS. There are no bells and whistles: you won’t find any repeaters, the radios don’t support digital communications, and there’s no FRS community to speak of. The frequencies are typically quiet in most parts of the country, except for the occasional kids messing around with the walkie-talkies they found under the Christmas tree (an increasingly uncommon gift). FRS can be a good choice for short-range emergency communications when your conversation partner isn’t particularly tech-savvy and is uninterested in paying for a license. The low cost of the radios is also a perk.</p>
			<p>
				Next, we have <em>General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS)</em>, an upgrade to FRS that allows more transmit power and permits the use of repeaters. Curiously, although most of the GMRS channels are shared with FRS, to use GMRS radios, you still need to get “licensed” in the United States. The license is really just another tax: you pay $35 to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and get a piece of paper for your effort, good for you and other members of the household.</p>
			<p>
				With this requirement satisfied, the maximum transmit power you can use is 50 W, although handhelds generally stick to around 2 W. There’s no discernible GMRS culture that I know of. The service appears to be used mostly for private communications between people who know each other, much like FRS. It’s fairly popular on farms and in other rural settings, but is largely displaced by cell phones in places where network coverage is robust. Still, in an emergency, GMRS can be a solid bet. GMRS repeaters can be found in some metro areas; to see if there are any nearby, you can visit <a class="LinkURL" href="https://mygmrs.com/browse/.">https://mygmrs.com/browse/.</a></p>
			<p>
				The last category of service—<em>ham radio</em>—is a bit of a different animal. At its core, it’s a license to build almost any equipment you please and transmit in almost any way you please, on a wide range of frequencies dedicated specifically for hobbyist use. The license requires passing an exam, and that exam requires you to spend a day or two memorizing a bunch of answers—some useful and some silly. It’s pretty straightforward, but you need to do the work; you can study and schedule a volunteer-administered exam at <a class="LinkURL" href="https://hamstudy.org/.">https://hamstudy.org/.</a></p>
			<p>Ham culture is comparatively sophisticated, with a number of clubs maintaining repeaters, drafting regional frequency plans, building emergency response plans, and so forth. The service also has a well-developed, if at times goofy, on-the-air etiquette, and a culture of experimenting with basic digital technologies, including packet networks and keyboard-to-keyboard comms. The frequencies used by ham operators generally aren’t crowded, given that the use of the spectrum has been declining since the 1990s, but you can still hear a fair amount of chatter in any major metro area if you scan the frequencies for a while. In a crisis, ham radio bands are where you’re most likely to encounter other preppers in your town.</p>
			<p>
				At the same time, <em>ham radio</em> is also shorthand for something more tangible: a range of more complex handheld transceivers, generally operating on 144 to 148 MHz or 420/430 to 450 MHz, meant for licensed amateurs who don’t want to be confined to the realm of consumer technologies such <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_188" title="188"/>as CB, FRS, or GMRS. Traditionally, the equipment came from a handful of Japanese manufacturers—Yaesu, Icom, Alinco, and Kenwood—but in recent years, the sales of ham handhelds are dominated by newer bands from China, notably including the ubiquitous BaoFeng: a cheap $25 radio that has gained notoriety as a fashion accessory of the far-right and far-left militias in the United States. Depending on the manufacturer and on how much you want to spend, the units available in this category range from basic products supporting analog voice transmissions, to sophisticated devices capable of sending digital audio, text messages, GPS beacons, and much more. The usual maximum transmit power is 5 W.</p>
			<p>
				Before we move on, it must be said that several other niche types of noncommercial radio systems exist, but they are more restricted or far less appealing than the options already outlined. The <em>Multi-Use Radio Service (MURS)</em>, for instance, offers just five channels and a dearth of consumer radios to choose from.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-502123c22-0003">Digital Radios and Data Transmission</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Digital communications can be worthwhile in a disaster, just as they are day-to-day. When your favorite mobile app is no longer working, for example, a computer-connected radio could run a neighborhood bulletin board or automatically display the GPS coordinates received from family members on the go.</p>
			<p>Alas, most consumer and amateur radios are stuck in the past. They use analog signals to encode voice, with the frequency or the amplitude of a carrier signal continuously adjusted to transmit sound waves. This is a rare anachronism in a world that has moved to digital in almost all other domains. Compared to analog voice, modern digital protocols require less bandwidth, less transmit power, and offer far better sound quality. Digital modes also offer support for reliable, high-speed data, with all the benefits noted earlier—and more.</p>
			<p>But today, betting on digital amateur radio is still risky. In addition to old-school amateurs being largely a recalcitrant bunch, a bit of a “system war” is going on: the three completely incompatible contenders are D-STAR, backed by Kenwood and Icom; System Fusion, backed by Yaesu; and Digital Mobile Radio (DMR), an offshoot of technologies developed for commercial use. It’s difficult to say who is winning. For example, there are plenty of Fusion-capable repeaters, but this is largely because the manufacturer is handing them out on the cheap to local clubs; the actual use of the system seems far lower than the repeater counts imply. Taking this into consideration, D-STAR and DMR are probably in the lead when it comes to organic use, and DMR is growing more rapidly, in part owing to the availability of sub-$100 radios from China. But the winner is still far from clear. If you decide to go digital today, there’s some risk of betting on the wrong horse and then having to switch to a completely different system down the line if you want to be able to talk to other folks.</p>
			<p>
				In addition to modern digital voice and data, the <em>Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS)</em> deserves a mention. This comparatively ancient but <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_189" title="189"/>still widely used digital protocol is used to send all sorts of short messages between radios. The messages can range from automated GPS beacons, to weather station reports, to hand-typed text. The huge perk of APRS is that many regions have substantial APRS infrastructure that automatically rebroadcasts and routes messages, possibly reaching destinations hundreds of miles away. In effect, APRS is an example of a decentralized mesh network that actually works today. Few radios support stand-alone APRS messaging between handhelds, but many can be tethered to a laptop or a phone, so tinkerers may find it an interesting piece of tech to experiment with. To check out the APRS repeaters and activity in your neighborhood, go to <a class="LinkURL" href="https://aprs.fi/">https://aprs.fi/</a>.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-502123c22-0004">Licensing Requirements</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Many preppers make the argument that in situations where a radio would be necessary, nobody’s gonna bother to enforce licensing rules. There might be some truth to that. But if they refrain from unlicensed use of their radio today out of the fear that the FCC is going to come busting through the door, they won’t know which repeaters they can reach or what the practical range of the radio may be in their neighborhood when a disaster strikes.</p>
			<p>
				Heck, with bargain-bin radios, it’s not uncommon to find out that they don’t properly transmit at all. Ham radio transceivers are also easy to put in an unexpected mode by pressing the wrong button, and recovery may be difficult. The manual assumes you already know what <em>SSB</em>, <em>squelch tones</em>, <em>notch filters</em>, and <em>VFO</em> mean. The problems aren’t insurmountable, but not fun when you’re working by flashlight without an internet connection to turn to for help.</p>
			<p>
				For all these reasons and more, those interested in ham radio should get the basic license: <em>technician class</em>. The test is simple. Some of the questions are perplexing and pointless, but they can be memorized with ease (and you don’t need a perfect score to earn a passing grade). If you really dislike the idea of exams, a solid GMRS handheld is probably a better plan; the Midland GXT1030VP4 seems like a good pick, with the added benefit of taking regular AA batteries in a pinch.</p>
			<p>For those taking the amateur radio route, the ham community can be a bit crotchety, with many clubs being rather protective of the things they’re familiar with and suspicious of newfangled tech. This is in part explained by the demographics: many of the most active members are retirees, and they’re more interested in discussing prostate exams than quadrature amplitude modulation digital modes. That said, you don’t really need to integrate. The frequencies aren’t crowded, and you’re unlikely to step on any toes as long as you aren’t being a jerk.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-502123c22-0005">Looking Beyond Handhelds</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Some seasoned amateur radio operators may be taken aback by this chapter’s singular focus on handheld radios. After all, they’d protest, stationary gear that transmits in the HF band (3 to 30 MHz) and uses skywave propagation can easily reach destinations hundreds of miles away!</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_190" title="190"/>This is true, but the emphasis on handhelds is intentional. Spending $50 or $200 on a pair of portable radios to maintain street-level communications may be easy to defend even if the ultimate benefits of the technology are limited. In contrast, investing thousands into stationary transceivers, antenna masts, and emergency power is a far tougher sell, especially if it needs to be done on both sides of the call.</p>
			<p>Serious ham radio enthusiasts will have an edge in some disasters, and preppers with a knack for electronics might be inclined to pursue the hobby for its own sake. But for most others, the benefits probably don’t justify taking the plunge—especially when, as noted earlier, satellite communicators offer a credible alternative.</p>

<p class="noindent">When I was in school, I was faced with a choice between pursuing a concentration in either information security or software engineering. The software engineering courses had terribly boring-sounding titles, so information security it was. Little did I know what a twisted and winding path I’d embarked on.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Information security as a career can take you many different places. Over the years, I’ve dealt with large-scale malware outbreaks, collected forensic information for court cases, hunted for foreign hackers in computer systems, hacked into systems and applications (with permission!), pored over an astonishing amount of log data, implemented and maintained all manner of security tooling, authored many thousands of lines of code to fit square pegs into round holes, worked on open source projects, spoken at security conferences, taught classes, and written somewhere into the upper regions of hundreds of thousands of words on the topic of security.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xx"/>This book surveys the information security field as a whole. It’s well-suited to anyone wondering what people mean when they use the term <em>information security</em>—or anyone interested in the field and wondering where to start. The chapters offer clear, nontechnical explanations of how information security works and how to apply these principles to your own career. It should help you learn about information security without making you consult a massive textbook. I’ll first cover the fundamental ideas, such as authentication and authorization, needed to understand the field’s key concepts, such as the principle of least privilege and various security models. I’ll then dive into a survey of real-world applications of these ideas in the areas of operations, human, physical, network, operating system, mobile, embedded, Internet of Things (IoT), and application security. I’ll finish up by looking at how to assess security.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec1">Who Should Read This Book?</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This book will be a valuable resource to beginning security professionals, as well as to network and system administrators. You should use the information provided to develop a better understanding of how you protect your information assets and defend against attacks, as well as how to apply these concepts systematically to make your environment more secure.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Those in management positions will find this information useful as well, because it should help you develop better overall security practices for your organizations. The concepts discussed in this book can be used to drive security projects and policies and to mitigate some of the issues discussed.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec2">About This Book</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This book is designed to take you through a foundational understanding of information security from the ground up, so it’s best read from start to finish. Throughout the book you will see numbered references to the Notes section at the end of the book, where you can find more information on some of these topics. Here’s what you’ll find in each chapter:</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">Writing this book was an adventure for me, as always. I hope you enjoy the result and that your understanding of the world of information security expands. The security world can be an interesting and, at times, hair-raising field to work in. Welcome and good luck!<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxii"/></p>&#13;

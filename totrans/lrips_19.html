The entrance was an archway cut
out of the bushes. A wooden sign above the entrance read</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="strong"><strong>WELCOME TO THE GARDEN OF FORKING PATHS.</strong></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“Here you go,” said Ping.</p><p>Laurie was suddenly very worried. “Ping, is this a laba . . . laber . . . one of those
garden mazes?” Laurie had read stories about little girls and garden mazes, and they never
ended well. Garden mazes were full of monsters and twisty little passages between you and the
exit.</p><p>“It’s not really a labyrinth. You can always find a way out,” said Ping.
“Where you end up is a different story.”</p><p>“Oh, good. After I deliver this letter, can I come back to the Treelighthouse? Maybe we
can ask the Network about how to find Hamilton!”</p><p>“That’s . . . a good idea. Yes. When you’re done, if you want, we can talk
about it.”</p><p>“Thank you! See you soon!”</p><p>“Good-bye, Laurie. Take care of yourself.”</p><p>Laurie and Xor stepped through the entrance into a kind of hallway made of more bushes. After
a short walk, they found a small fountain with a sign above it.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="strong"><strong>LEAVE A COIN. MAKE A WISH.</strong></span></p></blockquote></div><p>Laurie dropped her last Fair Coin into the fountain, closed her eyes, and made a wish. She
held her eyes closed for an extra moment just in case. But nothing exciting happened.</p><p>She kept walking down the green hallway. There wasn’t much to see except hedges, and
more hedges, and more signs that talked about the Garden.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="strong"><strong>DID YOU KNOW?</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>THERE ARE 16,777,216 PATHS THROUGH THE GARDEN.</strong></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“Only 16 million? That’s nothing!” Laurie said. “Userland had millions
of millions of <span class="emphasis"><em>millions</em></span>.”</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="strong"><strong>ONLY ONE PATH PER VISITOR.</strong></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“That’s okay. I want to get through here quickly.”</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="strong"><strong>ONLY ONE VISITOR PER PATH.</strong></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“Isn’t that the same thing?”</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="strong"><strong>NO.</strong></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“I wonder which path is the shortest,” Laurie said. The next sign answered her
question.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="strong"><strong>ALL PATHS ARE THE SAME LENGTH.</strong></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“Then how do I know which one to take?” she asked.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="strong"><strong>CHOOSE WISELY.</strong></span></p></blockquote></div><p>That’s when she came to the first fork in the path. Each fork had its own sign. The
left-hand sign said</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00001"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-01.png.jpg"/></span><span class="strong"><strong>THINGS</strong></span></p></blockquote></div><p>and the right-hand sign said</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="strong"><strong>IDEAS</strong></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00002"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-02.png.jpg"/></span></p></blockquote></div><p>Laurie had seen a lot of Ideas lately. A simple Thing would be a nice change. She took the
left-hand path. A minute later she came to the next fork. The signs there said</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00003"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-01.png.jpg"/></span><span class="strong"><strong>FAMILIAR THINGS | STRANGE
THINGS</strong></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00004"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-02.png.jpg"/></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“I’ve seen a lot of Strange Things lately, too,” she said. “I’ll
go for Familiar.”</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00005"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-01.png.jpg"/></span><span class="strong"><strong>YOUNG | OLD</strong></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00006"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-02.png.jpg"/></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“Um . . . Old!” Down the right-hand path they went.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00007"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-01.png.jpg"/></span><span class="strong"><strong>INTERESTING | BORING</strong></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00008"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-02.png.jpg"/></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“That’s an easy one,” said Xor. “Interesting.”</p><p>“You’re not the one who has to climb rocks and cross scary bridges when we make
Interesting deliveries,” Laurie said. “But okay.”</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00009"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-01.png.jpg"/></span><span class="strong"><strong>LOST | UNLOST</strong></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00010"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-02.png.jpg"/></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“How can you have a sign pointing to Lost things? Wouldn’t that make them
Unlost?” asked Xor.</p><p>“Maybe they’re only Lost until you find them,” Laurie mused.</p><p>“That makes sense.” Xor replied. They took the left path.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00011"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-01.png.jpg"/></span><span class="strong"><strong>MOSTLY LOST | COMPLETELY
LOST</strong></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00012"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-02.png.jpg"/></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“Comp . . . no, <span class="emphasis"><em>Mostly</em></span> Lost,” Laurie decided. Left
again.</p><p>“You know, I don’t see millions of paths,” said Xor. “There’s
only ever two.”</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00013"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-01.png.jpg"/></span><span class="strong"><strong>SMALL | NOT-SMALL</strong></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00014"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-02.png.jpg"/></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“Not-Small!” they said together.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="strong"><strong>BIGGER THAN YOU?</strong></span></p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00015"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-01.png.jpg"/></span><span class="strong"><strong>NO | YES</strong></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00016"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-02.png.jpg"/></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“Everything is bigger than me,” said Xor. “Let’s go
right.”</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="strong"><strong>BIGGER THAN A MOUNTAIN?</strong></span></p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00017"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-01.png.jpg"/></span><span class="strong"><strong>YES | NO</strong></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00018"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-02.png.jpg"/></span></p></blockquote></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Not that big!</em></span> They went right again.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="strong"><strong>TALLER THAN A LIGHTHOUSE?</strong></span></p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00019"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-01.png.jpg"/></span><span class="strong"><strong>NO | YES</strong></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00020"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-02.png.jpg"/></span></p></blockquote></div><p>Laurie had seen quite enough of lighthouses, too. She tried to go left, but a Shelled Green
Round animal barred the way.</p><p>“We meet again, Miss Ipsum,” it said.</p><p>“<span class="emphasis"><em>Mister Tortoise!</em></span> What are you doing here?”</p><p>“I’m enjoying a special treat,” said Tortoise, taking a bite out of the
greenery. “I help keep the mandelbroccoli bushes in the Garden nice and trim. For me it is a
delicious chore. And what are you doing here, Miss Ipsum?”</p><p>“I’m looking for the nearest exit so I can deliver a letter.”</p><p>Tortoise seemed to smile. Of course, he always seemed to be smiling. “There are millions
of paths through the Garden. All of them are exactly the same length.”</p><p>She tried to picture so many paths side-by-side. “I don’t understand. If there are
so many, where are they?”</p><p>“They are all around you. Every path forks off from another path,” Tortoise said.
“One path becomes 2, 2 becomes 4, then 8, 16, and so on. After 24 forkings, there are over 16
million different paths.”</p><p>“Oh! It’s the Power of Two again. But this time it gets bigger instead of
smaller,” Laurie said.</p><p>“Exactly right. You are currently on the path to Things that are Familiar, Old,
Interesting, Mostly Lost, Bigger Than You, and Smaller Than a Mountain,” said Tortoise.
“I suppose I am one of them.”</p><p>“So how do I choose which forks to take?”</p><p>“I suggest choosing wisely. Good day, Miss Ipsum.” Tortoise turned and walked
slowly and steadily down the left-hand path.</p><p>“Wait! I don’t know what you mean!” Laurie ran after him. Catching up with a
Tortoise should have been easy. But with every step he got farther and farther away. By the time
Laurie got to the next fork, he was nowhere to be seen.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00021"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-01.png.jpg"/></span><span class="strong"><strong>FRIENDLY | UNFRIENDLY</strong></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00022"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-02.png.jpg"/></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“What do you think, Xor? Which way?”</p><p>“Do you really want to see a Garden full of Unfriendly Things?”</p><p>“Good point.” She went left.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00023"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-01.png.jpg"/></span><span class="strong"><strong>IN THE AIR | ON THE GROUND</strong></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00024"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-02.png.jpg"/></span></p></blockquote></div><p>They didn’t want to see anything bigger than them that also could fly, no matter how
Friendly. Anyway, Tortoise was on the ground.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00025"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-01.png.jpg"/></span><span class="strong"><strong>LIGHT | HEAVY</strong></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00026"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-02.png.jpg"/></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“Heavy for sure!” shouted Xor.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00027"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-01.png.jpg"/></span><span class="strong"><strong>LIVES OUTSIDE | LIVES
INSIDE</strong></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00028"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-02.png.jpg"/></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“Tortoises live outside, don’t they?” Now that she thought about it, Laurie
wasn’t completely sure. But it seemed like a good guess!</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00029"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-01.png.jpg"/></span><span class="strong"><strong>NEVER SLEEPS | SOMETIMES
SLEEPS</strong></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00030"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-02.png.jpg"/></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“And they definitely sleep,” said Xor. Right they went.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00031"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-01.png.jpg"/></span><span class="strong"><strong>SLEEPS AT NIGHT | SLEEPS DURING THE
DAY</strong></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00032"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-02.png.jpg"/></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“Sleeps at Night!” Laurie shouted. “We should be getting
close!”</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00033"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-01.png.jpg"/></span><span class="strong"><strong>MANY COLORS | ONE COLOR</strong></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00034"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-02.png.jpg"/></span></p></blockquote></div><p>Laurie ran down the left-hand path without stopping to think. But wasn’t Tortoise only
one color? It was too late to go back.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00035"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-01.png.jpg"/></span><span class="strong"><strong>QUIET | NOISY</strong></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00036"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-02.png.jpg"/></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“I don’t like Noisy Things,” she said. “Tortoise is pretty
quiet.”</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00037"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-01.png.jpg"/></span><span class="strong"><strong>PLURAL | SINGULAR</strong></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00038"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-02.png.jpg"/></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“What does that mean?” “<span class="emphasis"><em>Plural</em></span> means more than one.
<span class="emphasis"><em>Singular</em></span> means only one,” Xor said. They went right.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00039"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-01.png.jpg"/></span><span class="strong"><strong>NATIVE | FOREIGN</strong></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00040"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-02.png.jpg"/></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“I know this one,” said Laurie. “<span class="emphasis"><em>Native</em></span> means from
here. <span class="emphasis"><em>Foreign</em></span> means from somewhere else. Native!”</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00041"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-01.png.jpg"/></span><span class="strong"><strong>EXPECTED | UNEXPECTED</strong></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00042"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-02.png.jpg"/></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“I wonder where we’ll end up,” she said as they turned right. “What is
Familiar, Old, Interesting, Mostly Lost, Bigger Than Me but Smaller Than a Mountain and Shorter Than
a Lighthouse, Friendly, On the Ground, Heavy, Lives Outside, Sleeps at Night—” (she
paused to breathe) “—has Many Colors and is Quiet, Singular, Native,

left path. The next sign made them think for a moment. It asked</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="strong"><strong>ARE YOU SURE?</strong></span></p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00045"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-01.png.jpg"/></span><span class="strong"><strong>YES | NO</strong></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00046"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-02.png.jpg"/></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“Sure, I’m sure!” said Laurie. “Why would I ever want someone
else’s wish?” She went down the left-hand path. “I think we’re almost
through the Garden, Xor!”</p><p>She started walking fast, then jogging, then running again down the long green hallway. Xor
was getting excited too, turning all sorts of polka-dot colors. Laurie was already thinking about
what messages she wanted to send to Fresnel, and Tinker, and—</p><p>“Oh no!”</p><p>Laurie stopped dead in her tracks. In front of them was another forking. The last one.</p><p>The left-hand sign said</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00047"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-01.png.jpg"/></span><span class="strong"><strong>HAMILTON (LAURIE’S WISH)</strong></span></p></blockquote></div><p>And the right-hand sign said</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="strong"><strong>AUNT VANA (XOR’S WISH)</strong></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><a id="inline_id00048"/><img alt="" src="figs/web/common-02.png.jpg"/></span></p></blockquote></div><p>“The Garden guessed my wish!” Laurie said.</p><p>“Mine, too,” Xor said.</p><p>Laurie started to go left, then stopped. Then she started to go right, but had second
thoughts. They stood there for a very long and very silent minute.</p><p>“We can only take one path,” said the girl.</p><p>“Yeah,” the lizard replied.</p><p>“And there’s no going back.”</p><p>“That’s the rule.”</p><p>“You really want to find your aunt,” Laurie said.</p><p>“And you really want to go back home,” Xor sighed.</p><p>“That means we have to choose,” Laurie said. “But how?” She did want
to go home, but she also wanted Xor to find Aunt Vana. She wanted to bring Xor and Vana home with
her and how cool would that be and—</p><p>“No, Laurie,” Xor said sadly. “It means we have to split up.”</p><p>“But—”</p><p>“Only One Visitor Per Path. That’s the rule.” He jumped off her shoulder and
landed on the right-hand sign. “I guess . . . this is how you found me.” His skin turned
orange and purple.</p><p>“We can do this,” said Laurie, thinking furiously. “Once you find your Aunt
Vana, take her to the Treelighthouse. I’ll find a way to come back. Or maybe I’ll get a
telescope and a big light and—”</p><p>“We’ll see each other again,” Xor said.</p><p>“Okay,” said Laurie. “Promise?”</p><p>“Promise.”</p><p>“And I’m going to whistle, okay?”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“So you can hear me.”</p><p>“Right,” said Xor.</p><p>“It’ll be fine.”</p><p>“Absolutely,” agreed Xor.</p><p>“Here I go.”</p><p>“Me too.”</p><p>Laurie did try to whistle, but it’s impossible to whistle and cry at the same time. Just
try it.</p></div></body></html>

    you recover forgotten passwords or access files you thought were lost forever.
    Learning to hack can also help you protect your personal information from online
    attackers. In fact, hacking yourself before the bad guys do is one of the best
    ways to protect yourself from cybercrime.

    how to think like a hacker and apply those skills to problem solving, cybersecurity,
    and staying safe online.

    Think of “life hacks,” like using dental floss to cleanly cut a slice of cake
    or reusing an empty breath mint container to store paper clips. For as long as
    humans have been on this planet, we’ve been coming up with new tools and new uses
    for the things we find around us.'

    all the time. We can hack together two programs that weren’t meant to work together
    by writing a small app that translates files from one program’s format to another.
    We can hack a web browser or spreadsheet program to play a game. Or, if you’re
    not careful, someone else can hack your computer by emailing you a virus that
    gives them access to your files, your passwords, or even your webcam.

    to punch and kick, as well as how to *block* punches and kicks. You’ll learn how
    to defend yourself and others from cyberattacks by safely performing those same
    hacks on yourself in a virtual lab. By using the same tools and techniques that
    hackers use, you’ll understand the kinds of online threats you need to defend
    against.

    much, we’ll refer to ourselves as *ethical hackers* in this book—to make it clear
    that we'll use the hacking skills we learn for ethical, legal purposes. I’ll use
    the terms *attacker* or *malicious hacker* when referring to someone who behaves
    illegally or unethically.

- en: '*Ethical hacking* is using an attacker’s tools and techniques to test a computer
    system for weaknesses, with the full permission of the system’s owner. The goal
    of an ethical hacker is to find weaknesses to improve the system’s security. We
    call this process *hardening* the system—removing and addressing weaknesses to
    make the system less vulnerable to attack.'

- en: An ethical hacker is also called a *white hat* hacker, while a *black hat* hacker
    is someone who uses cyberattacks unethically, whether for financial gain, vandalism,
    or other nefarious reasons. To illustrate the distinction, let’s say you find
    a key on the sidewalk. Simply finding the key isn’t unethical. In fact, if you
    walked up to the nearest home, knocked, and asked the owner if the key was theirs,
    that would be completely ethical. A white hat would ask if the owner of the home
    had accidentally dropped the key. On the other hand, if you pick up the key and
    start trying it in doors up and down the street, you’re acting like a black hat,
    because you don’t have the owner’s permission to use the key or enter their home.

    open. For example, some creative googling might turn up the default username and
    password to a security camera at a local grocery store. Simply finding this information
    isn’t unethical. Telling the manager of the store that the security camera is
    accessible online isn’t unethical either. But if you try to use the username and
    password to view video from the camera, *that’s* unethical, because you don’t
    have authorization from the owner.

    and usually illegal, just as going into someone’s house without permission is
    trespassing, even if they accidentally leave the door open or drop their key on
    the sidewalk. People will judge by your actions whether your behavior is ethical.
    Hack like a white hat hacker and use the skills you learn in this book for good,
    not for evil.

    any special tools—just a regular computer and web browser. You’ll begin by hacking
    your first password in Chapter 1, a saved web browser password. Attackers are
    after your passwords because if they can steal your login details, they can steal
    information or money from your accounts.

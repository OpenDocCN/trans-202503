    core framework and UI toolkit code.^([1](#c15-footnote-1)) This was an efficient

    Horowitz gave him: “Launcher needed to cold-start^([3](#c15-footnote-3)) in half
    a second. Launcher has to go peek at every apk^([4](#c15-footnote-4)) and load

  zh: Android自始至终的一个独特且强大的功能，就是其通知系统，能够在用户没有使用应用时，提醒用户其安装应用中的信息。
- en: Before smartphones, notifications were simpler (and less useful). Early data
    devices, like the Palm Pilot PDAs, had alert features in calendar and alarm apps.
    The user could configure these applications to play a noise, show a dialog, or
    illuminate an LED. Alerts of this sort were therefore limited to things the user
    thought to enter. All of the data on the device was created and synced by the
    user; there wasn’t information coming out of the ether onto the device. But once
    devices started connecting to the internet, new information, including email,
    messages, and even new calendar appointments, could land on the device asynchronously,
    and the user had to be told. Thus the need, and solution, for notifications was
    born. Dan Sandler, who joined Android in 2009 and led the system UI team, said,
    “The Danger Hiptop/Sidekick device took a tentative step forward in the state
    of the art on user alerts, with its rainbow notification light under the scroll
    wheel that could be used for SMS and new emails. Android would pick that ball
    up and run very, very far with it.”

  zh: 在智能手机出现之前，通知功能要简单得多（也没那么有用）。早期的数据设备，如Palm Pilot PDA，就有日历和闹钟应用中的提醒功能。用户可以配置这些应用播放声音、显示对话框或点亮LED灯。因此，这种提醒仅限于用户想到要输入的内容。设备上的所有数据都是由用户创建并同步的；没有信息会从空中传送到设备上。但一旦设备开始连接到互联网，新信息（包括电子邮件、消息，甚至新的日历约会）就可以异步地传送到设备上，用户必须被告知。因此，通知的需求和解决方案应运而生。Dan
    Sandler，2009年加入Android并领导系统UI团队，曾说：“Danger Hiptop/Sidekick设备在用户提醒的艺术上迈出了谨慎的一步，它在滚轮下方有一个彩虹通知灯，可用于短信和新电子邮件。Android接过了这个接力棒，并把它做得非常非常好。”
- en: There has always been a tension between apps and the operating system. Every
    app assumes that it’s the most important thing in a user’s life, so obviously
    the user wants to know everything possible from that app at all times. The user,
    meanwhile, might be surprised and annoyed to receive a notification from a game
    they just installed informing them that there’s a new level available. Part of
    the job of the system UI team over the years has been to provide limits for the
    applications to obey, as well as tools for the users to be able to mute overly
    chatty applications. In fact, part of the job of the operating system itself is,
    as Dan explained, “to provide limits for applications. Usually this is about shared
    resources on the device, like files, CPU time, and networking. With notifications,
    Android added the user’s attention to the set of things that the operating system
    mediated.”

    时间和网络。对于通知来说，Android 将用户的注意力添加到了操作系统调解的资源集合中。”

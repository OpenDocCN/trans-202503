- en: As Laurie ran out of the bank, a fat policeman grabbed her by the collar. “Got
    you!” he said. “Why are you running? Did you rob the bank, too?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “What? Who are you? Let me go!” Laurie yelled.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I’m Officer Custody, and *you* are in big trouble,” the policeman said. “Lauren
    Ipsum, *if* that is your real name, I arrest you on charges!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “What charges? What are you talking about?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “That doesn’t matter!” Custody shouted in Laurie’s ear, shaking her around.
    “Charges!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Ow! But *what* charges?” Laurie repeated. The officer’s hold on her was painful.
    People on the street were starting to point and stare. If there ever were a time
    Laurie wished she could disappear like a Steganosaurus, it was now!

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “You’re going to be difficult? Let’s do it nice and proper, if you insist!”
    Custody took out a roll of paper and cleared his throat.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Lauren Ipsum, you are hereby under arrest for Attempted Mythology, Counterfeiting
    Fair Coins, *two* counts of Impersonating a Composer, Hacking in the Third Degree,
    and Miscellaneous Mopery with Intent to Creep!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Let me go! You’re the creep!” Laurie tried to twist away, but his grip was
    too strong. Just then, a shout rang out from the crowd.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “*Hey, Custody! Why are you beating up on little girls?*”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A tough-looking woman stepped forward to confront the policeman. She wore big
    boots, black gloves, and an eyepatch in the shape of a heart.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “This isn’t a girl, Losesome. This is a dangerous criminal! She broke through
    our perimeter security,” Custody said.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “You mean Jane, that little old lady at the gate?” the woman asked.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Officer Hecate, yes!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Come on, Custody. Jane isn’t hard to fool. Last week I told her I was Santa
    Claus.” People in the crowd chuckled.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “That’s beside—”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “And what the heck is ‘Attempted Mythology’?” the woman interrupted. “I think
    you just made that up.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “What? I—”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “How do you even know you have the right person?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “She matches the description!” Custody insisted.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Really? She doesn’t look like Santa Claus to me!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “*No*,” he said. “She matches the description of the hacker who came through
    this afternoon!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “So you are saying a child was able to get through all of your super-duper security?”
    the woman said, arching an eyebrow skeptically.

- en: “Well—”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Anyway, this girl is my assistant.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By now Custody was thoroughly confused. “This little . . . she works for *you*?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Of course. She’s helping me test the security of this place. And if a *child*
    can run circles around you . . .” She shook her head. “Let’s just say, it doesn’t
    look good.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “But you’re—”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Custody was suddenly sweating. He let go of Laurie and pulled out a handkerchief.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Hey, now, it was an honest mistake! I didn’t know she worked for the Col—um,
    you.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Well, now you do. And now we’re leaving. Come on, Laurel.” The woman took Laurie
    by the arm and walked away, head held high.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Let’s just walk away slowly,” the woman whispered. “When we turn the corner,
    try to make it to the marina before Custody starts using his brain instead of
    his mouth.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As soon as they were out of Custody’s sight, they broke into a run.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “That was great! But my name is Laurie, not Laurel.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Close enough. I’m Winsome Losesome.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “It’s nice to meet you! Thank you for helping me! I didn’t mean to cause trouble.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Don’t mention it. I was leaving town anyway. And I really don’t like that guy.
    He’s a dumb bully.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the marina, Winsome jumped aboard a boat and went to work getting it ready
    to depart. “Come on! Hop on,” she called to Laurie.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Whose boat is this, Winsome?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “It’s my boat, the *Doppelganger*. Get that other rope for me, would you?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Wow, how did you get a boat? Are you a pirate?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I’m a lot of things, girl.” Winsome said. “As for the boat, I kind of stole
    it. But I stole it honestly!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “How can you steal something *honestly*?” Laurie was afraid that she was getting
    into even more trouble.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I used to be a deckhand on this boat,” she said. “The Boss made me do all of
    the dirty work. ‘Losesome, replace the main mast!’ he’d say. ‘Put a new rigger
    on the widdershins!’”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Winsome unfurled the sail.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “But secretly, I was saving all the old parts I replaced. They were going to
    the trash anyway, so might as well keep them, right? Once I collected enough pieces,
    I quit, and then I put them back together into a boat. Boss never found out, either!
    The boat he has is all replacement parts. A copy. I have the *real* one.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “But—” Laurie began.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Think about it later, sweetie? We’re busy running from the Law.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Winsome had a point. Laurie untied the rope, and they cast off into the moonless
    night.

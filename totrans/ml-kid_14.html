<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="OpenerCap"><img src="Images/Alphabet-F.png" alt="Alphabet-F" class="dropcap" width="74" height="80"/></span>or a lot of people, AI brings to mind visions of robots and science fiction. Hopefully you’ve learned from the projects in this book that AI is already here, and it is all around us. </p>
<p class="ChapterIntroContinued">Understanding how ML systems are created gives you a better understanding of how the world around you works. That understanding provides insight into <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="252" id="Page_252"/>how companies know what you’re thinking and recommend products you might like. And it helps you recognize that when you’re asked to rate something, or prove you’re a human, or tag a face in a photo, you’re probably training someone’s ML system. </p>
<h2 id="h1-500563c16-0001">The Future</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">If our lives are all going to be impacted by ML systems in the future, we might have an opinion on how they are trained and applied. </p>
<p>For example, what applications are appropriate for ML systems, and what decisions should be left to humans? </p>
<p>Should machines make decisions involving your healthcare? Or how law enforcement behaves? Or who can get a credit card or a mortgage?</p>
<p>Who should be responsible for collecting the training data used to create the most important ML systems? And who should be checking how training is done? How should ML systems be tested, and should you be able to see the results of those tests for the ML systems you use?</p>
<p>The fundamentals that you’ve learned in this book—such as the impact of the amount and balance of training data on ML models, the measures we use to describe an ML model’s performance, and the sorts of things that can go wrong—are all useful to get you thinking about these important questions. </p>
<p>They’re also an essential starting point if you choose to study ML further and learn about how different ML systems are implemented. I hope that this book has encouraged you to explore more. </p>
<h2 id="h1-500563c16-0002">Next Steps</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">If you’d like to learn more, one option is to build your own ML project. Many of the AI projects created by companies around the world are built using online ML services provided “in the cloud,” just as you’ve been doing so far. With these services, you provide the training data, the cloud service creates an ML model using it, and then you test the model to make sure it does the job that you need. You can continue using Scratch if you want, or progress to using a text-based programming language like Python.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="253" id="Page_253"/>Alternatively, if you’d like to understand more about how ML works, you can switch from using ML models that are built and hosted on the cloud to building and running your own ML models. This gives you more control over the behavior of your ML systems and also helps you learn how they work internally. You’ll need to start using a text-based programming language, such as Python, but if you’re willing to do that, there’s a wide variety of free ML technology frameworks available to get you started. TensorFlow is one of the most widely used, and there are free tutorials on the TensorFlow website (<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/" class="LinkURL">https://www.tensorflow.org/</a>) that will help you build your first ML model.</p>
<p>I hope that this book is only the start of your ML journey. Whether you use what you’ve learned about ML to create your own AI projects and applications, to build ML models yourself, or to understand a little more about how the online services you use every day work, I wish you luck with your next steps. </p>

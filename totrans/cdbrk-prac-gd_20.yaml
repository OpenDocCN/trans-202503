    a standardized way of representing letters, numbers, and punctuation in binary
    digits, which are the zeros and ones that computers can understand. For example,
    the lowercase letter *a* is encoded as 01100001, and a capital *A* is encoded
    as 01000001\. We can also represent these values in hexadecimal (base 16) for
    easier reading, such that *a* is 61 and *A* is 41\. Though ASCII is called a code,
    it is not really encryption; it is just a table of values, as is Morse code.

    they are different. For example, if 1111 is XORed with 0000, the result is 1111\.
    If 1111 is XORed with 0010, the result is 1101\. And if 1010 is XORed with 1110,
    the result is 0100\. In cryptography, letters in words are sometimes converted
    to ASCII and XORed with the 1s and 0s of a predetermined key. The resulting binary
    stream is then transmitted to a receiver, who XORs them back to the original plaintext.
    If the binary key is random, we call this a Vernam cipher or a special case of
    a one-time pad.

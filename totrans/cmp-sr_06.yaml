- en: The internet hosts a huge number of different *websites* (or just *sites* for
    short) run by different companies, organizations, or individuals. For example,
    Walmart, Best Buy, and the *New York Times* all operate their own websites, and
    each has a different purpose and different content. Most sites break down their
    content into a number of *pages* to make it easier to read and organize. For example,
    a news site like the *New York Times* might devote one page to each news article
    it covers, whereas a store such as Walmart or Best Buy might have a page for each
    product it sells. This collection of sites makes up the *World Wide Web*, or *the
    web* for short. To begin exploring the web, we need a way to navigate to the sites.
    One way to do that is to use a site’s unique address.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might have seen various companies advertise their websites with addresses
    like *[www.bestbuy.com](http://www.bestbuy.com)* or *[www.gumtree.com.au](http://www.gumtree.com.au)*.
    A web address gives you an easy way to find a particular site by letting you go
    straight there, like with a street address. As you’ll see in [Lesson 6](ch6.xhtml#ch6),
    you can also search for a site without using its web address, but using its address
    is often quicker and ensures you’re going to the right site.

    You might also see a site ending in *.org*, such as *[www.wikipedia.org](http://www.wikipedia.org)*,
    indicating that it’s run by an organization (usually a nonprofit). There’s also
    *.edu*, indicating an educational institution like *[www.harvard.edu](http://www.harvard.edu)*,
    and *.gov* for a government site like *[www.usa.gov](http://www.usa.gov)*. These
    are just guidelines, though; there’s nothing preventing someone from registering
    a *.com* site even if they’re not part of a company. So you don’t need to pay

    the others we’ve discussed, has something after *.com*. The *.au* is a country
    code that stands for *Australia*. Sites outside the United States often have such
    a code telling you where they’re based, either after *.com* or instead of it (for
    example, *[www.kijiji.ca](http://www.kijiji.ca)* is a popular classifieds site

    Often the name of the site will be filled in for you by default. In some cases,
    the name might be very long or even quite different from what you expected. You
    can change this to something you’ll recognize easily. The text in the Name box
    should appear highlighted in blue. If it is, you’ll be able to start typing a
    new name right away. If it isn’t, move your mouse cursor to the box, click at
    the right end of the current text, and use the BACKSPACE key to erase it.

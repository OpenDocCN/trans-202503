<p class="noindent">Engineering and reverse engineering are two sides of the same coin. The best makers know how to hack their tools, and the best hackers routinely make new tools. I might set out to design a circuit, and find myself reverse engineering a chip because the datasheet is vague, incomplete, or simply incorrect. Engineering is a creative exercise; reverse engineering is a learning exercise. When you combine them, even the toughest problems can be solved as a creative learning exercise.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I spent over a quarter-century in school, but I’ve learned more about electronics from reverse engineering. I love trying to figure out why the engineer behind a piece of random hardware made certain design choices. Highly skilled engineers develop clever tricks without realizing how innovative they are. Those tricks often go undocumented or unpatented, and the only way to tap that knowledge is to decipher it from finished designs.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">After seeing enough boards, I started recognizing patterns and personal styles that almost have a cultural nature about them. For example, Apple circuit boards are austere and black, with a look almost as iconic as Steve Jobs’s black mock turtlenecks. There are so many decisions to make when designing a circuit board that most engineers can only draw from their <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_276"/>cultural influences and toolchains to constrain stylistic things like fonts and part choices.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This kind of learning is so important to me that, for over a decade now, every month I’ve presented a circuit board on my blog and challenged readers to divine its function from its design. Part of my motivation for holding these regular competitions is to make reverse engineering feel culturally acceptable to readers. People often ask me if reading other people’s designs or modifying and hacking hardware is legal. But anyone who has raised a child knows that learning through emulation is a part of human nature. I disagree with interpretations of the law that put the terms of a software license above your right to own your hardware. If you can’t hack it, you don’t own it.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The importance of democratic access to technology only grows as we become increasingly dependent on smartphones and computers. Technology is fundamentally neutral toward human ethics; the people who control technology are responsible for applying it ethically. One school of thought believes that technology should be controlled by a select group of trusted masters; the other believes that control over technology should belong to anyone with the motivation and will to learn it. Increasingly, our technology infrastructure is becoming a monoculture managed by a cartel of technology providers. Everyone carries identical phones running operating systems based on the same libraries and uses one or two cloud services to store their data. But history has proven that a monoculture with no immunity is a recipe for disaster. One virus can wipe out a whole population. Universal access to technology may allow the occasional bad actor to develop a harmful exploit, but this bitter pill ultimately inoculates our technological immune system, forcing us to grow stronger and more resilient. Wherever that threat comes from, a robust and vibrant culture of free-thinking technologists will be our ultimate defense against any attack.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_277"/>Speaking of viruses and immune systems, there are remarkable parallels between hardware systems and biological systems. Just as hacking is all about rethinking APIs to do unexpected things, a central tenant of biology—evolution—is all about superior implementations of “APIs” superseding weaker interpretations.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I routinely read journals about the life sciences not just because I find the subject fascinating, but also because it’s good for me. Looking outside your primary field for fresh ideas is very helpful for problem solving. Figuring out how an organism works is an incredibly difficult reverse engineering problem: there’s no documentation, there’s no designer to consult, and your diagnostic tools are roughly equivalent to throwing crate after crate of smartphones into a blender and running the mixture through various sieves. Biologists have developed a bag of extremely clever tricks to map out complex systems without the benefit of an oscilloscope, and at a high level, some of the principles are applicable to electronic systems.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As our understanding of biology becomes more complete, there’s ample opportunity for computer engineering principles to advance the field. We’re already at the point of custom-engineering organisms; the technology to hack humans—or engineer our successor—is likely to arrive within decades. Such powerful tools deserve a closer look so that we can make independent judgments about what is fact and what is fiction.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">While engineering is a creative activity, hacking is an important and often underrated learning exercise. The ability to effortlessly switch modes from forward to reverse engineering is a powerful tool, and the right to hack is the foundation of a healthy technological culture. The first chapter in this section reviews some of my own hacking methods and efforts and discusses some of the legal frameworks that protect these activities. The second chapter attempts to unpack some key concepts from biology and frame them from the perspective <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_278"/>of an electronics person. The final chapter in this book is a collection of interviews where I discuss what being a hacker means to me, as well as recap some of my experiences in manufacturing and hardware startups. The collection isn’t exhaustive, but I hope you enjoy reading some of my more off-the-cuff thoughts.</p>&#13;

    all over the world, and this appendix highlights features in Scratch 2 that promote
    connecting with others. In particular, you’ll learn how to create an account,
    how to use your backpack to work with sprites and scripts created by others, how
    to remix other people’s projects, and how to publish your work and share it with
    the Scratch community.

    is, on the Scratch server), but it’s still a good idea to click Save before you
    exit Scratch. The Save as a copy option saves your current project with a different
    name. If your current project is named *Test*, for example, the new project will
    be named *Test copy*. (You can change that name by typing a new one in the project’s
    name edit box.) The Revert option discards any changes you’ve made since you opened
    the current project.

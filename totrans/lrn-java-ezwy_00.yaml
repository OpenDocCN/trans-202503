    software, Java powers the largest enterprises and the smallest personal devices.
    Students, IT professionals, and anyone considering a career in programming will
    find that they need to learn Java. As a computer science professor who has taught
    Java for almost 20 years, I wrote this book to help you learn Java the way I learned
    to code: with hands-on projects. I’ve found that students learn best by building
    real apps and games that are interesting, engaging, and worth sharing. In this
    book, you’ll make a simple Hi-Lo guessing game, a Secret Messages app to exchange
    messages with friends, and an interactive drawing app called BubbleDraw. No prior
    programming experience is required, but if you have learned other languages, you’ll
    also pick up Java faster using this hands-on approach.'

    ten fastest-growing, highest-paying job fields are in computing. Programmers are
    in demand worldwide, and millions more will be needed over the next several years.
    No matter where you are, as long as you have an internet connection, you can make
    money as a programmer.

    is problem solving, and the world needs more problem solvers. You can write apps
    that connect people and help them work. You can enable new forms of commerce and
    even create entirely new markets. You can break down barriers, help an individual
    or a community or a whole continent, and create opportunities that hadn’t existed
    before. Thanks to the reach of the internet and smartphones, you can write an
    app and share it with billions of people.

    to a superpower,” and Gabe Newell, cofounder of video gaming’s Valve Corporation,
    says knowing how to code makes you “look like you have magic powers compared to
    everybody else.” Computers are all around us—in every device, every system, and
    every network in our daily lives—and code is what makes all those computers work.
    Learn to code, and you learn to thrive in a high-tech future.

    up Java, Eclipse, and Android Studio. You’ll also write your first Java commands
    using the JShell interactive shell.

- en: In **[Chapter 2](ch2.xhtml#ch2)**, you’ll write your first application—the Hi-Lo
    guessing game, a text-based, command line program that has a player guess a random
    number between 1 and 100\. In **[Chapter 3](ch3.xhtml#ch3)**, you’ll upgrade the
    guessing game into a windowed, desktop application, complete with a graphical
    user interface (GUI) featuring labels, a text field, and a clickable button.

- en: In **[Chapter 4](ch4.xhtml#ch4)**, you’ll build your first Android mobile app,
    reusing much of the Hi-Lo guessing game code from the previous two chapters. Once
    you have the mobile app completed, in **[Chapter 5](ch5.xhtml#ch5)**, you’ll add
    several finishing touches to the guessing game, including a settings menu and
    a high scores feature.

    app, a text-based program that scrambles messages using a Caesar cipher. In **[Chapter
    7](ch7.xhtml#ch7)**, you’ll give the app a GUI upgrade by adding a slider bar
    tool that will allow you to crack Caesar ciphers quickly. Then, in **[Chapter
    8](ch8.xhtml#ch8)**, you’ll make a mobile Secret Messages app with sharing functionality,
    which will allow users to share secret messages back and forth by email, text
    message, or social media with the touch of a button.

    in the book—the BubbleDraw app, which allows the user to draw colorful bubbles
    on the screen. In **[Chapter 10](ch10.xhtml#ch10)**, you’ll add animation to make
    the bubbles float and bounce around the screen as they’re drawn, and in **[Chapter
    11](ch11.xhtml#ch11)** you’ll add multitouch functionality to draw bubbles in
    several places at once. By the end of this chapter, you’ll have a professional-looking
    app that you’ll want to share with all your friends!

    computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux. You don’t even need an Android phone
    or tablet to build mobile applications, because Android Studio comes with a free
    Android device emulator that you can use to test your apps. Of course, if you
    have an Android device, you’ll be able to run your mobile apps directly on your
    phone or tablet.

There are many ways to create models in Blender, from modifying primitives, like a simple cube or sphere, to building the surface of a mesh face by face or drawing smooth curves that Blender can convert into objects composed of vertices and faces.</p><p>Modeling can be a long process, and to save time, it helps to know where you are going with a particular modeling task. Still, you can’t model an object all at once; you have to start somewhere, and that’s where blocking in comes in. <span class="emphasis"><em>Blocking in</em></span> is the process of adding simple placeholders for the objects you want to create so that you can better plan how they fit together, consider their individual constructions, and spot problems before they become major issues. Once a scene has been blocked in, you can move on to refining, replacing, or adding to each part to create a final model. For example, in the Jungle Temple scene, simple elements like cubes are used as placeholders for key elements; for other projects, we create simple base meshes for sculpting that act as a foundation for developing the final form of our sculpted models.</p><div class="sect1" title="Basic Modeling Terms"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="basic_modeling_terms">Basic Modeling Terms</h2></div></div></div><p>Before we dive in, here are some definitions of Blender’s basic modeling concepts that I’ll use throughout this chapter. <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#important_terms_for_modeling_in_blendera" title="Table 4-1. Important Terms for Modeling in Blender’s Edit Mode">Table 4-1</a> lists them in hierarchical order: Vertices make up edges, which make up faces, and so on.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Edit Mode"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="edit_mode">Edit Mode</h2></div></div></div><p>Edit mode (shown in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#blenderapostrophes_3d_viewport_in_edit_m" title="Figure 4-1. Blender’s 3D Viewport in Edit Mode">Figure 4-1</a>) is where the modeling magic happens.

Each has its place in modeling, but the most important (after meshes) are Bézier curves, which we’ll use often throughout the modeling sections of this book.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Bézier curves</em></span> define a path in 3D space and are constructed using control points and handles. They can be used to make both wire- or ribbon-like objects that follow the path of a curve (using closed or open curves) and flat surfaces that are defined by their outline (using closed 2D curves). Each control point has two handles that define how the path flows through that vertex, allowing you to create a wide array of smooth and sharp paths with a curve.</p><p>Modeling with curves works very much like using meshes; you can grab, rotate, scale, duplicate, and extrude control points or their handles.

For this project, my initial concern was designing a layout for the environment that lent itself to creating a nice composition. I began with only the main elements in the scene: a door into the interior of the temple and some stone blocks and trees strewn around the ruins.</p><p>To create the door, I added a cube in Object mode (<span class="smaller">SHIFT</span>-A▸Mesh▸Cube) and scaled it (<span class="strong"><strong>S</strong></span>) to about the size I needed. Once you activate the Scale operator, you can constrain scaling along one axis (by pressing <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span>, or <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span>) to scale the object in only one direction. You can also scale on all <span class="emphasis"><em>but</em></span> one axis by pressing <span class="smaller">SHIFT</span> and <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span>, or <span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span>.</p><p>Switching to Edit mode (<span class="smaller">TAB</span>), I added a hole by extruding in the two outside faces and scaling them on the <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>- and <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span>-axes only. Next, I deleted the center faces (<span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span>) and created new faces around the hole in the center by selecting two open edges at a time and making a face between them (<span class="strong"><strong>F</strong></span>), as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#making_a_simple_door" title="Figure 4-7. Making a simple door">Figure 4-7</a>.</p><p>Back in Object mode, I added a plane (<span class="smaller">SHIFT</span>-A▸Mesh▸Plane) and scaled it up to form the ground plane of the scene. Then I added a camera and moved it to roughly view the door I was looking for. A quick way to do this is to navigate to the view you want just within the 3D Viewport and then press <span class="smaller">CTRL-ALT</span>-0 to snap the camera to the current view. You can also just move and rotate the camera like any other object. Note that this might result in the camera getting slightly tilted. You can rectify this by manually setting the Y rotation of the camera to 0, using the Rotation properties in the Transform panel of the Properties region (<span class="strong"><strong>N</strong></span>).</p><p>From here, I added some simple walls to form the main boundaries of my scene simply by adding, scaling, moving, and extruding cubes. Next, I began adding more cubes, keeping in mind how they would become the final architectural elements of the scene, like stone walls, statues, and loose blocks of stone. This progression is shown in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#blocking_in_with_simple_elementsdot_i_be" title="Figure 4-8. Blocking in with simple elements. I began with the door and then added a ground plane, walls, and cubes to represent major elements in the scene.">Figure 4-8</a>.</p><p>With the simple elements blocked in, I began to add rough proxies for the trees I wanted growing over the ruins. To create these proxies, I added a Bézier curve object and set the handles to automatic. Then I used Blender’s Snapping tools to extrude curves resembling the roots and trunks of trees over the surfaces of the placeholder objects (<a class="xref" href="ch04.html#by_snapping_the_tree_roots_to_their_surr" title="Figure 4-9. By snapping the tree roots to their surroundings, we can quickly block in tree roots crawling over the surface of the ruins.">Figure 4-9</a>). <a id="iddle1157" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2363" class="indexterm"/>I accomplished this by turning on Snapping, setting the snapping target to faces, and enabling Project onto Surface (<a class="xref" href="ch04.html#snapping_icons" title="Figure 4-10. Snapping icons">Figure 4-10</a>). This projects the curves onto the other objects in the scene as you move and extrude them, allowing you to “draw out” the trees over the top of the existing scene.</p><div class="figure"><a id="making_a_simple_door"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00044"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538330.png.jpg" alt="Making a simple door"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 4-7. Making a simple door</div></div><div class="figure"><a id="blocking_in_with_simple_elementsdot_i_be"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00045"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538332.png.jpg" alt="Blocking in with simple elements.

To turn on Snapping, click the Snapping icon (the horseshoe magnet) in the header of the 3D Viewport (see <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#snapping_icons" title="Figure 4-10. Snapping icons">Figure 4-10</a>). Then, from the drop-down menu beside the Snapping icon, select how Blender will snap your selection when it’s moved, scaled, or rotated from among the following options:</p><p title="Increment"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Increment</strong></span></strong></span>. Your selection will snap to the nearest increment so that you can construct objects with precisely aligned points. This is useful for modeling things like buildings or mechanical objects where you want perfectly aligned walls and floors with no lumps or bumps. (You can also snap your selection to Blender’s grid by pressing <span class="smaller">SHIFT</span>-S▸<span class="strong"><strong>Selection to Grid</strong></span>.)</p><p title="Vertex/Edge/Face/Volume"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Vertex/Edge/Face/Volume</strong></span></strong></span>. Your selection will be snapped to the vertices, edges, faces, or interior of any objects. You can change what Blender chooses to snap to from the drop-down menu that appears. Click the icon to the right of the drop-down menu to rotate the selection so that it aligns with the normal vertices that it snaps to.</p><p>One very important snapping option is found in Face Snapping mode. Enabling Face Snapping causes the Project onto Surface icon to appear. Project onto Surface will cause geometry you create to snap onto the surface of existing objects as you move, scale, or rotate them around. This option allows you to create new topology over the surface of an existing object. In <a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Retopology">Chapter 7</a>, we will be creating new topology over the surface of existing objects to better capture their shapes after we have sculpted the originals.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Base Meshes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="base_meshes">Base Meshes</h2></div></div></div><p>To create the Bat Creature, I needed a simple base mesh that could be sculpted on. A base mesh is a simple model that captures the basic shapes of the model you want to sculpt. Once you’ve created a base mesh, you can add a Multiresolution modifier and begin subdividing and sculpting details in Sculpt mode (see <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Sculpting">Chapter 6</a>).</p><p>Your base mesh should capture the overall proportions of the mesh and be designed to subdivide easily in order to provide a nice even mesh to sculpt on. We can retopologize the sculpted base mesh later to create the final model, but working with very simple geometry now will leave more freedom for experimentation while sculpting.</p><p>A base mesh can have any level of complexity, but try to create topology that will support the forms that you know you want to create, without introducing too many details that you might not be sure about. Depending on how sure you are of what you want your model to look like, you can include topology for features like eyes, mouths, and muscle groups, or you can leave it as simple as a basic sphere or cube if you’re just modeling a face.</p><p>For the Bat Creature, I aimed for a base mesh that gave topology for the overall body plan but left out fine details, such as the head. I developed the base mesh by setting my concept art as a background image and using it as a guide.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Building the Bat Creature Base Mesh"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="building_the_bat_creature_base_mesh">Building the Bat Creature Base Mesh</h2></div></div></div><p>I started with the torso of the creature to provide a guide for the scale of the rest of the parts, as well as something to attach them to. To begin, I took the default .<span class="emphasis"><em>blend</em></span> file (the scene you are presented with when Blender starts up) and deleted any objects already present. Then I loaded in the concept drawing for the Bat Creature (as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#concept_art_loaded_in_as_a_background_im" title="Figure 4-11. Concept art loaded in as a background image">Figure 4-11</a>). (For help with this, see <a class="xref" href="ch03.html#using_concepts_and_reference_images_in_b" title="Using Concepts and Reference Images in Blender">Using Concepts and Reference Images in Blender</a>.) While I didn’t plan to use this concept to model from exactly, it made a useful guide for judging the proportions as I worked. At this point, I left the wings out of the base mesh for the body, as I planned to model them separately later.</p><div class="figure"><a id="concept_art_loaded_in_as_a_background_im"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00048"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538338.png.jpg" alt="Concept art loaded in as a background image"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 4-11. Concept art loaded in as a background image</div></div><p><a id="iddle1080" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1103" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1256" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1374" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1428" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1485" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1780" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1857" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1899" class="indexterm"/>Next, I added a cube, changed to Edit mode (<span class="smaller">TAB</span>), and scaled it to the rough proportions of the torso. I did this first in overall terms by just scaling it to the right width (<span class="strong"><strong>S</strong></span>). Then I scaled up the <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span>-axis (<span class="strong"><strong>S</strong></span>▸<span class="strong"><strong>Z</strong></span>) before scaling in on the <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>-axis (<span class="strong"><strong>S</strong></span>▸<span class="strong"><strong>Y</strong></span>) to make it taller and shallower. By adding horizontal loop cuts (extra rings of edges around the mesh, as discussed below) around the middle of the cube (<span class="smaller">CTRL</span>-R) and moving them forward a little, I added a bit of curvature to the torso and began refining its shape.</p><p>At this point, it was easier to start using a Mirror modifier to keep my mesh symmetrical because the model was becoming more complex. To do so, I added a loop cut vertically around the middle of the torso and deleted its right-hand side. Adding a Mirror modifier then mirrored the geometry of the left-hand side of the body to create a symmetrical whole that only required editing on one side (see <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#adding_a_mirror_modifier_to_the_body_req" title="Figure 4-12. Adding a Mirror modifier to the body requires adding an edge loop around the middle and deleting half of the torso first. By default, the mirror modifier mirrors objects around the x-axis, but you can change this to mirror around any combination of the x-, y-, and z-axes, depending on your model.">Figure 4-12</a>). At the same time, turning on clipping keeps vertices on the midline from straying away from the object’s <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> origin, which prevents holes from appearing in the mesh if you accidentally move a vertex slightly away from the line of symmetry.</p><div class="sect2" title="Loop Cuts and Face and Edge Loops"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="loop_cuts_and_face_and_edge_loops">Loop Cuts and Face and Edge Loops</h3></div></div></div><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>face loop</em></span> is a string of quads connected end-to-end in a continuous path, allowing an <span class="emphasis"><em>edge loop</em></span> (a chain of connected vertices) to be cut through the middle. For example, in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#you_can_add_multiple_loop_cuts_by_scroll" title="Figure 4-13. You can add multiple loop cuts by scrolling your mouse wheel or entering a number with the keyboard after pressing CTRL-R.

The T pose is useful when <span class="emphasis"><em>rigging</em></span> a character (the process of creating an armature that tells the mesh how to move as if it had bones and joints). However, the T pose looks rather tense and unnatural when modeling, an effect that can stick around when posing a character into other positions. Instead, I wanted the character to look as relaxed and neutral as possible while in the early stages of modeling so that I could progress away from this neutral position later. By relaxing the arms down toward the character’s sides, I eliminated this tension to make the character’s default pose much more natural.</p><div class="figure"><a id="extruding_the_armsdot_creating_a_corner"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00052"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538346.png.jpg" alt="Extruding the arms.

For example, the Sharp Falloff option will create sharp peaks if you grab and move a single vertex, whereas the Sphere Falloff option will create bulbous, spherical shapes. The Random Falloff option is useful for roughening up the surface of a mesh; by grabbing a single vertex and moving it a little, with a wide radius for the falloff, you can add a slight random variation to the surface of a mesh.</p><p>Proportional editing is useful for many things besides tweaking proportions.

To make sure the gap could be filled in neatly, I spaced out the vertices along the bones so that they roughly matched up with one another, adding more as needed or shifting existing ones.

(The extrusion/scaling won’t produce perfect results, but you can tweak the position of the vertices manually to get a nicer layout.)</p><p>With the gaps filled in, I selected the whole model and extruded it back to give it some thickness, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#blocking_in_the_wingsdot_the_wings_are_e" title="Figure 4-26. Blocking in the wings.

For example, I next wanted to use a Mirror modifier to copy the wings over onto the other side of the base mesh for the Bat Creature, but after using the Warp operator and moving and rotating the wings in Edit mode, adding a Mirror modifier would have given incorrect results (see <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#with_the_objectapostrophes_coordinate_ax" title="Figure 4-27. With the object’s coordinate axes turned on, it becomes obvious why the Mirror modifier isn’t producing the desired effects.

Because the Mirror modifier uses these coordinates to mirror the object, the results were not what you might expect.</p><p>To see an object’s local coordinates, turn on the Axes setting in the Object tab of the Properties editor (see <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#with_the_objectapostrophes_coordinate_ax" title="Figure 4-27. With the object’s coordinate axes turned on, it becomes obvious why the Mirror modifier isn’t producing the desired effects. Applying the transforms on the mesh before applying modifiers produces more predictable results.">Figure 4-27</a>). To reset the axes to match the global coordinate system, use each of the Apply Location/Rotation/Scale operators in Object mode (<span class="smaller">CTRL</span>-A) in turn, which will place the object’s origin at the global origin and match the rotation and scaling of its local coordinates to the global coordinates without affecting its shape. As a result, you’ll be able to model, add modifiers, and perform other operations with more predictable results.</p><div class="figure"><a id="with_the_objectapostrophes_coordinate_ax"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00064"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538370.png.jpg" alt="With the object’s coordinate axes turned on, it becomes obvious why the Mirror modifier isn’t producing the desired effects.

The reason for this is that it makes it easier to read at a glance the direction that the faces of a mesh are pointing and to see how the forms of the mesh are progressing. Later on, I will use smooth shading to render some of the models in order to make them look smooth (<a class="xref" href="ch04.html#flat_and_smooth_shading_modesdot_smooth" title="Figure 4-29. Flat and Smooth shading modes. Smooth shading blends between the normals of a mesh’s faces to make it look smooth. You can switch between the two modes using the Shade Smooth and Shade Flat operators in either Object or Edit mode.">Figure 4-29</a>), but for now this isn’t necessary. To switch between the two, simply select your mesh, and in the Tool Shelf, use the Flat and Smooth operators to switch the shading of your selection between flat and smooth shading. You can do this either in Object mode, which affects the whole of each selected object, or Edit mode, which affects only the selected faces.</p><div class="figure"><a id="finished_body_base_mesh"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00065"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538372.png.jpg" alt="The finished body base mesh"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 4-28. The finished body base mesh</div></div><div class="figure"><a id="flat_and_smooth_shading_modesdot_smooth"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00066"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538374.png.jpg" alt="Flat and Smooth shading modes.

To generate more detailed ideas for the main parts of the body, I used sculpting and then retopologized the results and added more mechanical parts with traditional modeling.</p><p>Beginning with two cubes, one for the abdomen (back segment) and the other for the cephalothorax (head and body segment), I scaled them roughly to the correct proportions, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#creating_base_meshes_for_the_spider_bot" title="Figure 4-30. Creating base meshes for the Spider Bot">Figure 4-30</a> <span class="gray-background">1</span>. By adding a Subsurf modifier (<span class="smaller">CTRL</span>-1), I was able to get a more rounded shape without having to add and manually adjust lots of edge loops. Just adding a couple more edge loops brought me closer to the shapes I needed <span class="gray-background">2</span>.</p><p>After joining the two cubes into the same object in Object mode (<span class="smaller">CTRL</span>-J), I applied the Subsurf modifier at subdivision level 1 to give more geometry to play with <span class="gray-background">3</span>, but I copied the modifier first to further subdivide the mesh. When a modifier is applied, changes it makes to the mesh are applied to the mesh and thus converted into geometry you can edit. This allowed me to extrude some of the new faces from the front of the body to create a bump for the head <span class="gray-background">4</span>. With the extruded faces still selected, I pressed <span class="smaller">CTRL</span>-+ to grow the selection, fattened it a bit with <span class="smaller">ALT</span>-S, and then smoothed it a little to complete my base mesh for sculpting the body.</p><p>For the legs, I began by laying out my plan for the main part of the leg, consisting of long, flattened, bone-shaped pieces for the long segments of the leg and shield-shaped pieces for the knee and foot segments. I created two slightly different variations of the long segments, one for the first and last pairs of legs and one for the middle two pairs <span class="gray-background">5</span>. To create these pieces, I began with a plane, added a Mirror modifier to make the leg symmetrical, and then extruded one edge and added loop cuts to create the top-down plan of the leg. Next, I selected the whole thing (<span class="strong"><strong>A</strong></span>) and extruded it out along its normals by first extruding (<span class="strong"><strong>E</strong></span>) without moving the new faces. I then moved the new faces along their normals (<span class="smaller">ALT</span>-S) to give the leg segment a uniform thickness. For now, I created only one copy of each piece; after sculpting and retopology, I’ll duplicate the finished parts and position them to make the legs. This completes some basic parts for the Spider Bot.</p><div class="figure"><a id="creating_base_meshes_for_the_spider_bot"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00067"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538376.png.jpg" alt="Creating base meshes for the Spider Bot"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 4-30. Creating base meshes for the Spider Bot</div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="In Review"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="in_review-id00009">In Review</h2></div></div></div><p>This chapter laid the foundations for the models. For the Spider Bot and the Bat Creature, this entailed creating base meshes with simple topology that we’ll later use to sculpt on and flesh out the designs of our characters. In the case of the Jungle Temple, I blocked in the most important elements of the scene with simple placeholder meshes. In the next chapter, we will replace and expand upon these placeholders, as well as model some extra details for the other two projects and discuss some more in-depth modeling concepts along the way. Then in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Sculpting">Chapter 6</a>, we will move on to sculpting the base meshes created in this chapter using Blender’s sculpt tools.</p></div></section></body></html>

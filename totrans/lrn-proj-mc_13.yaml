- en: This is a momentous occasion. You’ve just finished the book. It’s been a long
    journey, for me and for you! Since I started writing this book, I’ve grown several
    beards, lived in three different cities, and found out that bananas don’t produce
    seeds. Honestly, I’ve had so much fun writing this thing. At moments it was hard
    and tiring, but I stuck with it because I wanted you to read it.

- en: Since you started this book, you’ve covered a lot of ground. You’ve learned
    about the fundamentals of programming in Python and made some really cool programs
    that use these concepts to do amazing things in Minecraft. You’ve learned about
    variables, math operations, strings, input, Booleans, `if` statements, `while`
    and `for` loops, functions, lists and dictionaries, modules, files, and classes.
    You may have been a complete beginner when you started this book, but with this
    knowledge, you’ll be capable of doing some really advanced things in Python.

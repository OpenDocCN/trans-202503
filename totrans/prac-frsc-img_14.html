<p class="noindent">Forensic image acquisition is an important part of postmortem incident response and evidence collection. Digital forensic investigators acquire, preserve, and manage digital evidence to support civil and criminal cases; examine organizational policy violations; resolve disputes; and analyze cyber attacks.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><em>Practical Forensic Imaging</em> takes a detailed look at how to secure and manage digital evidence using Linux-based command line tools. This essential guide walks you through the entire forensic acquisition process and covers a wide range of practical scenarios and situations related to the imaging of storage media.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You’ll learn how to:</p>&#13;
<p class="sq"><img class="middle" src="../images/common02.jpg" alt="image"/> Perform forensic imaging of magnetic hard disks, SSDs and flash drives, optical discs, magnetic tapes, and legacy technologies</p>&#13;
<p class="sq"><img class="middle" src="../images/common02.jpg" alt="image"/> Protect attached evidence media from accidental modification</p>&#13;
<p class="sq"><img class="middle" src="../images/common02.jpg" alt="image"/> Manage large forensic image files, storage capacity, image format conversion, compression, splitting, duplication, secure transfer and storage, and secure disposal</p>&#13;
<p class="sq"><img class="middle" src="../images/common02.jpg" alt="image"/> Preserve and verify evidence integrity with cryptographic and piecewise hashing, public key signatures, and RFC-3161 timestamping</p>&#13;
<p class="sq"><img class="middle" src="../images/common02.jpg" alt="image"/> Work with newer drive and interface technologies like NVME, SATA Express, 4K-native sector drives, SSHDs, SAS, UASP/USB3x, and Thunderbolt</p>&#13;
<p class="sq"><img class="middle" src="../images/common02.jpg" alt="image"/> Manage drive security such as ATA passwords; encrypted thumb drives; Opal self-encrypting drives; OS-encrypted drives using BitLocker, FileVault, and TrueCrypt; and others</p>&#13;
<p class="sq"><img class="middle" src="../images/common02.jpg" alt="image"/> Acquire usable images from more complex or challenging situations such as RAID systems, virtual machine images, and damaged media</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">With its unique focus on digital forensic acquisition and evidence preservation, <em>Practical Forensic Imaging</em> is a valuable resource for experienced digital forensic investigators wanting to advance their Linux skills and experienced Linux administrators wanting to learn digital forensics. This is a must-have reference for every digital forensics lab.</p>&#13;

    optimist’s guide to doomsday*: a merry stroll through the world of disaster preparedness.
    It would be a sharp rebuke to the endless apocalyptic mirages that slowly suffocate
    those glued to 24-hour cable news, but also a heartfelt suggestion to keep some
    cash and food on hand, just in case.'

    after generation, bet that things would get better. In the face of some of the
    darkest moments in human history, they worked hard, raised children, and took
    care of each other. They persevered through unimaginable terrors and periods of
    uncertainty far greater than what I stand to experience today. They didn’t always
    live happy lives, and sometimes their own anger or fear led them astray. But they
    never gave up. They bet on the future—and in doing so, they helped build a better
    world for all of us. I feel that I owe my children and grandchildren the same.'

    is not. The philosophy I try to preach is the ethos of joyful resiliency: the
    art of looking at the world around us, in all its chaotic glory, and resolutely
    asking what can go wrong—but never assuming that it *must* go wrong. It’s the
    art of not making bitter demands of others, but of reinventing ourselves to cleverly
    and confidently dispel the anxieties and frustrations of everyday life.'

    how hard we may try to prepare for them. But then, whatever the misfortune, the
    ride can be less bumpy when we have a solid backup plan—and a few extra gallons
    of water, too.

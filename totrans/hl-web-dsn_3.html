<h2 class="h2b"><strong>THE PROCESS AND TRAINING YOUR DESIGN EYE</strong></h2>
<p class="noindentt1"><span class="small">NOW THAT WE’VE CHATTED ABOUT DESIGN PRINCIPLES</span> and the pieces of design, let’s work on the process of design. While the last few sections have thrown a lot of theory at you, these next sections are geared toward adding real-world context to what you have learned and helping you do design work.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">The following sections will walk you through the parts of design from start to finish — finding inspiration, sketching your project, getting feedback, and building. We will talk about these steps in abstract but also apply them to a sample project so you can see how everything comes together.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">For our sample project, we’re going to build on a theoretical home page for an open source project — a place where visitors can learn about and use the project, with links to documentation and information on how to contribute to the project.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Let’s get started!</p>
<p class="sec" id="ch00lev1sec98"><a id="page_88"/>SECTION 3.1</p>
<p class="sec1" id="ch00lev1sec99">FINDING INSPIRATION</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><span class="small">WHAT’S THE FIRST THING YOU SHOULD DO</span> when starting a design project?</p>
<p class="noindentt1">If you think that you should sit down and start working on ideas, sketching layouts, planning your content — you’re close, but not quite ready to go there yet.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Sitting down and immediately working on a design problem without first doing research and looking for inspiration is like trying to code without access to the internet to look up questions and errors — doable, but slower and more frustrating.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Think of inspiration as visual debugging. Looking at great design and inspiration will help you figure out solutions to problems that you may run into when creating your own designs.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Where to find inspiration? For web design, there are tons of websites that collect and share good designs <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch03.xhtml#ch3fig1">FIGURE 3-1</a>)</strong>.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Of course, do <em>not</em> rip off designs. If you find something you like, you can do something similar, but ripping off something verbatim is a very big no-no. But you <em>can</em> be inspired by layout, <a id="page_89"/>the treatment of color, the tone, the imagery, and the typography and implement the things you like into your own project. Try to focus on a specific aspect of a design that you like, rather than the entire thing, and apply it to your project.</p>

<p class="figcap" id="ch3fig1"><strong>FIGURE 3-1:</strong> Some of the many options you can use to find web design inspiration.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Your job as designer isn’t to reinvent the wheel. Noting established conventions and things that “work” will help you implement familiar flows and layouts in your own designs — making it more intuitive for your users to navigate your product.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">My <em>Hello Web App</em> books were inspired by the wonderful <em>A Book Apart</em> books <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch03.xhtml#ch3fig2">FIGURE 3-2</a>).</strong></p>
<p class="noindentt1">I’m particularly proud of my design for <em>Hello Web App</em>, but I sincerely don’t think they would have turned as they did without being heavily inspired by <em>A Book Apart</em>. Seeing those books helped me determine what I liked in terms of size and <a id="page_90"/>thickness, and the flat, bright colors inspired my own graphic treatment of the <em>Hello Web App</em> cover.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch3fig2"><img alt="image" src="../images/03fig02.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 3-2:</strong> My <em>Hello Web App</em> books on the left, and the beautifully designed <em>A Book Apart</em> series on the right.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Pablo Picasso famously said, “Good artists copy, great artists steal.” When you find something you love, something that you’d like to do yourself — whether it’s layout, color, font choice, and so on — use that as inspiration to build something <em>similar</em> but not <em>exactly</em> the same.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">One of the most useful things you can do to make yourself better at design is to look at other designs and think critically about what they do well and what they do poorly. This is a great process to practice while you’re looking for inspiration!</p>
<p class="noindentt1">The more you do this (with good designs as well as bad), the more you’ll train your “design eye” and design intuition, making it easier for you to create good designs from scratch.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Let’s use the GitHub home page design as an example <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch03.xhtml#ch3fig3">FIGURE 3-3</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch3fig3"><a id="page_91"/><img alt="image" src="../images/03fig03.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 3-3:</strong> GitHub has consistently great-looking home page designs, great for practicing picking out good design decisions.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Using the principles we went over in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>, Theory and Design Principles, what would you say they’re doing well? Some of the details I’ve picked out:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Lots of white space.</strong> The headline, content, and form have plenty of white space around the top and bottom, drawing the eye and emphasizing the content. Just enough white space — not too much and not too little.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Sign-up form is front and center.</strong> No need to jump through hoops — GitHub makes it super simple to sign up for an account right from the front page. Note that the “Username” field has focus by default so the user can start typing immediately.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Important words are bolded and linked in the content.</strong> Both “open source” and “business” are linked, bolded, and in a brighter color. At a glance you can see the two areas that GitHub focuses on.</p></li>
<li><a id="page_92"/><p class="noindent5"><strong>Subtle background pattern helps the white space feel less empty.</strong> Imagine the background in a flat gray — the design would still look good but would feel less polished. The subtle pattern fills the white space while letting the content shine.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Main button is a bright, stand-out color.</strong> The majority of the design is dark and gray, making the bright green form submit button stand out.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindentt1">What other good design decisions can you see?</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Start browsing the web more mindfully, and think critically about what designs are doing well and poorly. Over time, your design intuition will improve. Making this a practice will make it easier for you to create better designs naturally.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">This is especially important when you’re actively working on a new design. Start out by looking for inspiration in examples of good design in your field and by looking at your competitors. Pick out what they’re doing well, and implement those ideas in your own design. Pick out what you think isn’t working well (especially in your competitor’s designs), and make sure you avoid those things in your own design.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Our sample project for <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a> was our widget. For this chapter we’re going to be building a home page for an open source project. Let’s start by finding some really clean and visually interesting home pages for other open source projects <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch03.xhtml#ch3fig4">FIGURE 3-4</a>)</strong>.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">There are a number of trends that will be nice to implement in our own design:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Lots of white space</strong> — open source project home pages are fairly simple (compared to, say, a newspaper home page) and an airy, designer-y feel is a nice contrast to something aimed at developers.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="image" id="ch3fig4"><a id="page_93"/><img alt="image" src="../images/03fig04.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 3-4:</strong> A few well-designed open source project home pages that we’ll use for inspiration.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Bright colors</strong> — either as a full background or as highlights on top of a white background.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Clear, prominent headlines that explain the tool.</strong></p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Code is front and center</strong> — naturally, a product made for developers should show the code involved right at the start rather than hiding it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindentt1">This part of the process is very much affected by personal preference — I chose four designs that I personally loved and inspired me; you might disagree with my choices. That’s totally okay! Design is very personal, and at the end of the day you will want something that represents <em>you</em>.</p>
<p class="sec" id="ch00lev1sec100"><a id="page_94"/>SECTION 3.2</p>
<p class="sec1" id="ch00lev1sec101">PLANNING</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><span class="small">YOU <em>COULD</em> JUMP STRAIGHT INTO CODING</span> and start creating your site using your inspiration, but the middle process of design — creating a plan, sketching ideas and layouts, and making a mock-up — will help you try more ideas and create a better design in overall less time. It’s a bit of effort up front that’ll save a lot of time down the line.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Your life will be so much easier if you do some basic planning before moving ahead with trying to sketch and develop your design. How many pages do you need? What kind of content do those pages need? What kind of forms do you need, and how many fields?</p>
<p class="noindentt1">We’re going to build our open source project home page sample project as a single page with links out to external documentation — making our plan rather simple. Just one page!</p>
<p class="noindentt1">On this one page, let’s list the elements we’ll need:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="noindent5">Logo/name of project.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5">Headline explaining the project.</p></li>
<li><a id="page_95"/><p class="noindent5">Menu with links to external documentation on Read the Docs, GitHub page, author’s Twitter.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5">Block showing code (to show how easy it is to install).</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5">Three blocks with benefits and features in more depth.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5">Positive quote from contributor.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5">Repeated menu in the footer.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindentt1">Most websites won’t be this simple. Let’s think about another scenario, such as a personal portfolio website for a designer named Jane, which would require more pages.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">First, let’s determine what pages we need for a personal website for Jane:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Home page:</strong> The first page someone sees when they hit the website.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>About page:</strong> A deeper dive into Jane’s background and experience.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Portfolio page:</strong> An overview of Jane’s projects.</p>
<p class="mdash">— <strong>Individual project pages:</strong> These pages will probably use the same layout, so we can group them under one category.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Contact page:</strong> A page with Jane’s location and information about how to contact her.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindentt1">Right away, we can see that we have five basic types of pages that we will need to design layouts for. Now that we have the basic pages, what do we want each page to have on it?</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Every page:</strong></p>
<p class="mdash">— Personal logo or name.</p>
<p class="mdash">— <a id="page_96"/>Top menu listing all top-level pages in the website (that is, we’re only going to list the four main bullets above, not each individual portfolio page).</p>
<p class="mdash">— Footer menu after content.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Home page:</strong></p>
<p class="mdash">— Short, exciting description of Jane.</p>
<p class="mdash">— Photo of Jane.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>About page:</strong></p>
<p class="mdash">— Longer descriptive paragraph.</p>
<p class="mdash">— Different image of Jane.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Portfolio page:</strong></p>
<p class="mdash">— Blocks for each of Jane’s projects with a photo/screenshot of each, project title, and links to individual project pages.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Individual project pages:</strong></p>
<p class="mdash">— Image representing project.</p>
<p class="mdash">— Long description of project.</p>
<p class="mdash">— Links to external resources (code on GitHub, launched website, and so on).</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Contact page:</strong></p>
<p class="mdash">— Short introduction paragraph.</p>
<p class="mdash">— Email address and location.</p>
<p class="mdash">— Form for contact with fields for name, email, short content section, and a submit button.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindentt1"><a id="page_97"/>Making a plan and listing of all these pages, features, widgets, and blocks will help you organize your design process and ensure that you don’t miss an important element when sketching and building your design.</p>
<p class="line"> </p>
<p class="noindentt1">At this point, you could jump over to coding your site, but I highly recommend taking some time to build some prototypes. We’ll cover this in the next section!</p>
<p class="sec" id="ch00lev1sec102"><a id="page_98"/>SECTION 3.3</p>
<p class="sec1" id="ch00lev1sec103">PROTOTYPES</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><span class="small">THE PROCESS OF SKETCHING YOUR IDEAS</span> and making prototypes will help you play with solutions and try out different ideas faster than if you moved straight to coding. This usually happens in tandem with the inspiration process. As you go through and find ideas you like, you should make note of these ideas you’d like to implement and sketch out how they could fit into your own design.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Sketching can seem more intimidating than it is. Perhaps you’ve seen sketches of websites that look like <strong><a class="ash1" href="ch03.xhtml#ch3fig5">FIGURE 3-5</a></strong>.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">You <em>can</em> sketch something like the one in <strong><a class="ash1" href="ch03.xhtml#ch3fig5">FIGURE 3-5</a></strong> if you like, but that really isn’t how initial sketches are made. Sketching is more abstract, uses minimal detail, and works with your imagination to make everything come together. All you really need are boxes and lines to start jotting down some ideas for layouts and how your design should look <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch03.xhtml#ch3fig6">FIGURE 3-6</a>)</strong>.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">This creates a quick and easy shorthand to start sketching out your design ideas. Here are some more examples from when I was redesigning the <em>Hello Web Books</em> website from my own sketchbook <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch03.xhtml#ch3fig7">FIGURE 3-7</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch3fig5"><a id="page_99"/><img alt="image" src="../images/03fig05.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 3-5:</strong> Sketches don’t <em>need</em> to have this much detail.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch3fig6"><img alt="image" src="../images/03fig06.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 3-6:</strong> Low-information sketches. Squiggles represent headlines or larger text, lines represent content, boxes indicate buttons, and x-ed out boxes represent images.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch3fig7"><a id="page_100"/><img alt="image" src="../images/03fig07.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 3-7:</strong> Messy (digitized) sketches from my personal notebook where I was planning the new <em>Hello Web Books</em> website design.</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><a id="page_101"/>Again, these sketches aren’t pixel perfect: they’re meant to provide quick layout ideas to help you start building your design. Quick, messy, easy, and definitely not perfect.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">You can upgrade your sketches by adding shading or different shades of gray, but try to keep your sketches as unstyled as possible in this initial round. No fancy fonts, no colors, no exact dimensions. Keep this round as easy as possible on yourself so you can quickly create as many different ideas as possible <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch03.xhtml#ch3fig8">FIGURE 3-8</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch3fig8"><img alt="image" src="../images/03fig08.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 3-8:</strong> Paper sketches showing basic lines, boxes, image locations, and content placement. Sketches don’t need to be too complicated.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Let’s return to our sample project and sketch out a few quick ideas for home page layouts for our open source project <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch03.xhtml#ch3fig9">FIGURE 3-9</a>)</strong>.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Here are quick sketches of two different home page layout ideas, but I recommend that you do more when you’re sketching <a id="page_102"/>your ideas. The more layouts you do, the more ideas you’ll go through, which will help you gain confidence in the sketch (or sketches) you choose to build wireframes from.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch3fig9"><img alt="image" src="../images/03fig09.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 3-9:</strong> A couple of quick sketches showing two different home page layout ideas for our sample open source project home page.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">If don’t have a particular project in mind, sketching the layouts of your favorite websites is great practice.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec104"><a id="page_103"/><strong>Wireframing</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">Next, we make our quick sketches more concrete. Wireframing helps us build in extra detail from our sketches, working with real sizes for placement and helping us figure out spacing in a more refined representation of our design.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">There are a lot of different software solutions available to help you with this stage <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch03.xhtml#ch3fig10">FIGURE 3-10</a>)</strong>.</p>

</ul>
<p class="noindentt1">Wireframes come between the sketch and mock-up stages. At this stage we are <em>not</em> choosing colors or finding fonts — we’re just continuing to think about layout and flow.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Going back to our open source project home page, we’re going to take my favorite sketch and use it to create a wireframe <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch03.xhtml#ch3fig11">FIGURE 3-11</a>)</strong>.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">We’re using a three-column layout, starting to plan our content (making sure it’s short, easy to understand, and exciting) and figuring out spacing and layout. Once we have these elements in place, we can start testing our design (see <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch00lev1sec106">Section 3.4</a>: Getting Feedback) and trying out ideas until we have something we want to move forward with.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">We’re still missing major design decisions such as fonts, color, and graphics, but this bare-bones wireframe gives us a great place to start when getting feedback from others and coding the site.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch3fig11"><a id="page_105"/><img alt="image" src="../images/03fig11.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 3-11:</strong> A quick wireframe based on one of our sketches. No major design choices — just layout and spacing.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">It’s important to use real content — avoid fake content such as lorem ipsum (dummy text used by the design industry) — as much as possible. With real content, you’ll know the length of text you need, which is crucial when making your layout, rather than using fake text that may end up being longer or shorter than the text you eventually use.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Pay attention to the content principles we’ve gone over, making sure your content is short, easy to read, and exciting. As you go through the sketching, wireframing, and mocking <a id="page_106"/>up stages — revising and testing different versions of your designs — you should be revising and improving your content as well.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Let’s look at an unrelated idea so we can get another example of what wireframes would look like <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch03.xhtml#ch3fig12">FIGURE 3-12</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch3fig12"><img alt="image" src="../images/03fig12.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 3-12:</strong> Another wireframe example.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Again, no fonts or colors, but this quick wireframe shows planned layout (mainly one narrow column with menu options around the logo), and some design decisions, such as using a bulleted list for content and a form that’s high enough on the page to be seen without scrolling.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Wireframing should help you make simple layout decisions so you can try ideas quickly and test them without spending time on small design details or changing large chunks of code.</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><a id="page_107"/>Depending on what you’re doing, you <em>could</em> move straight to code after creating your wireframes, or you could create a mock-up to explore final colors, fonts, and images.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec105"><strong>Mocking up your design</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">Wireframes are pretty low-fidelity — we can also create high-fidelity mock-ups in our design programs before we move to code so we can get every design detail planned (fonts, colors, backgrounds, and so on) before moving onto code.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">This part of the design process is a bit tougher if you haven’t used a design program before. In <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">Chapter 5</a>, Additional Resources, I cover tutorials and videos on basic design skills for major design programs.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Some pros and cons to spending the extra time mocking up your design:</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p class="noindent5">You’ll see <em>exactly</em> what your design will (hopefully) look like when you move into building it in <span class="small">HTML</span> and <span class="small">CSS</span>.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5">Objects can be easily moved and transformed, so you can change your mind more quickly than if the design were already coded.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindentt1"><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p class="noindent5">Adds an extra step that could take more time.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5">As you’re designing for the web, your eventual website needs to be <em>responsive</em> (the design adapts so it looks as good in smaller screens as it does in larger). Responsive designs are harder to mock up, as most design solutions are static. You’d need to create mock-ups that show the design adapting to different sizes (mobile, computer, and so on).</p></li>
<li><a id="page_108"/><p class="noindent5">If you’re not comfortable with design programs (or you’re more comfortable with code), mocking up may take more time than coding in <span class="small">HTML</span> and <span class="small">CSS</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindentt1">Your mock-ups should include all of the decisions you made before about content and layout from your wireframes with the additional bonus of planning for graphics, colors, fonts, and extra-beautiful design tweaks <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch03.xhtml#ch3fig13">FIGURE 3-13</a>)</strong>.</p>

<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 3-13:</strong> Mock-up showing color, font, and imagery decisions using the design program Sketch.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Let’s take the wireframes for our sample home page and start adding some color, fonts, and imagery. Focus on making this first draft <em>just</em> good enough to launch and show others, as you can continue iterating and improving the design over time <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch03.xhtml#ch3fig14">FIGURE 3-14</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch3fig14"><a id="page_109"/><img alt="image" src="../images/03fig14.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 3-14:</strong> Back to our sample project. Go from wireframe to mock-up by adding color, imagery, fonts, and other style decisions. This example is still very simple, but it works as a first version. You could launch this and then iterate on the design and make improvements over time.</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><a id="page_110"/>Once you have a mock-up you like, it’s time for another round of testing and sharing the design with friends and family (covered in depth in the next section) to ensure you’re not missing anything crucial before spending time coding the site.</p>
<p class="line"> </p>
<p class="noindentt1">At this point, you can copy your home page design and build mock-ups for the other pages (such as an About page), as well as mock up what your website will look like on smaller screens <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch03.xhtml#ch3fig15">FIGURE 3-15</a>)</strong>.</p>

<p class="noindentt1">In the next section we’re going to cover a very important part of the design process (hinted at throughout this section) — getting feedback!</p>
<p class="sec" id="ch00lev1sec106"><a id="page_111"/>SECTION 3.4</p>
<p class="sec1" id="ch00lev1sec107">GETTING FEEDBACK</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><span class="small">ONE OF THE HARDEST BUT MOST CRUCIAL PARTS</span> of the design process is getting feedback on what you’ve designed.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Unlike programming, there no simple “working” or “not working” answer to what you’ve designing. You can’t tell at a glance whether your design is successful without getting feedback from outside sources. This simple step can be the toughest, because we’re all naturally afraid of negative feedback. What if the person hates what we’ve designed? What if they find problems?</p>
<p class="noindentt1">A design might feel right to you, but you’re the designer — you know all the ins and outs of the design, how it works, and how it should be used <em>because</em> you’re the designer. You’ll only know whether those paths and objectives are obvious after showing your design to someone else. Your design might be beautiful, but you don’t know whether it’ll be appreciated and used until you show it to others.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">It’s natural to feel bad if someone discovers something that isn’t working. When this happens, look at it as a learning experience and try to remember that these pieces of feedback will <a id="page_112"/>improve your design and teach you something new. Accept bad feedback with grace — there is no need to feel embarrassed or insulted. Better to hear bad news early on rather than after you launch.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">It’s totally normal to not want negative feedback, but finding out where your design can be improved will make your design stronger and your experience better in the long run. Detach your feelings, steel your will, and find the problems early.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec108"><strong>Seeing your design with fresh eyes</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">Before you take your design to others, give yourself a chance to critique your own design. Simply taking a break from your design (a few hours or overnight) can help you figure out potential design issues and problems. This is the easiest way of getting feedback, because you’re working with someone naturally agreeable — yourself!</p>
<p class="noindentt1">When you come back to your design, try to distance yourself from your designer-self and to embody the potential user. Is your design usable? Easy to read and understandable? Is the design easy to use and natural feeling? Go through the user experience and imagine how the website will be used — find all the “easy” issues as early as possible before you share your design with others.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Another trick for getting a quick fresh look at your design is to take a screenshot and flip it horizontally. It’s still the same layout, but your brain will lose some of the familiarity with the design so it will be easier to be more objective and pick out problems.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec109"><a id="page_113"/><strong>Some advice on showing your design to others</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">You could take your design to someone else, get a “looks great!” in response, pat yourself on the back, and move on with your day. But was that really valuable feedback?</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Make sure that you’re clear about what kind of feedback you’re looking for. Maybe you’d like help finding problems with your design and you’re open to general feedback (positive or negative) and criticisms, or perhaps you need help choosing between two options. Alternatively, you might be 90 percent done and only looking for minor tweaks before you publish.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Give your reviewers careful instructions about what you need and plenty of time to look at your work. A quick glance at your design isn’t enough, so don’t surprise the reviewer between other tasks. Let them have time to really think critically about what you have done. Quick responses are more likely to only cover superficial issues or be hollow praise.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">If you receive only positive responses, try asking specifically for what the reviewer <em>didn’t</em> like. This could prompt a more thorough response and also indicates that you’re looking for (rather than avoiding) negative feedback.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Keep in mind that when you ask for feedback, you also need to judge the feedback that comes in. Talk to more than one person, as a problem that comes up only once might not be an actual problem. If an issue surfaces over and over, <em>then</em> you’ve found something that needs to be fixed.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Not all feedback has to be implemented. It’s up to you, the designer, to figure out the true issues versus the things the reviewer mentioned because they wanted to be helpful.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec110"><a id="page_114"/><em>Showing your design to friends and family</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">Your friends and family are the friendliest folks you can go to for design feedback, for better or for worse. Those that are closest to you are the most likely to want to please you and may want to give only positive feedback. Here is where it’s especially important to make it clear you’re looking for all feedback (positive <em>and</em> negative).</p>
<p class="noindentt1">It’s great if you can show your designs to folks who match your ideal user (if you’re building a tool for developers, another developer friend would be a great tester), but don’t feel limited to that rule — <span class="small">UX</span> issues could be found by anyone.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec111"><em>Showing your design to strangers</em></h4>
<p class="noindentt1">Although significantly harder, showing your design to strangers can yield more valuable feedback because they aren’t affected by their personal relationships with you.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Where can you find strangers who might be willing to give feedback?</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Hackathons, sprints, and other community events.</strong> Events and gatherings of like-minded peers are great places to get feedback on design work. Ask someone politely if they’d be willing to spend 5 to 10 minutes reviewing your design.</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Online communities.</strong> Forums and communities such as Reddit’s <em>design_critiques</em> subreddit (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/85">hellobks.com/hwd/85</a></em>) and Bootstrapped.fm (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/86">hellobks.com/hwd/86</a></em>) can help review mock-ups and early versions of your design. Internet anonymity creates a tendency for strangers to be negative, so here especially you need to sort the useful feedback from the bad. A thick skin is essential.</p></li>
<li><a id="page_115"/><p class="noindent5"><strong>Online review services.</strong> There are quite a few online services that allow you to upload a screenshot of your design to get feedback. One example is Five Second Test (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/87">hellobks.com/hwd/87</a></em>).</p></li>
<li><p class="noindent5"><strong>Folks at coffee shops and the like.</strong> No hackathons near you? You can also try the classic usability test trick — buy a couple of $5 gift cards to a coffee shop of your choice, approach friendly looking strangers, and ask them for five minutes of feedback in exchange for the gift card (or a coffee, or something similar). Approaching a stranger in a public place can be scary, but getting a stranger’s feedback on your design is so valuable that it’s worth it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindentt1">This step is so easy to skip, especially when you’re adhering to the <span class="small">MVP</span> (<em>minimum viable product</em>) advice of launching as fast as possible, but getting feedback can vastly improve the design and usability of your project. You might find an issue that could make or break your project launch.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">If getting feedback from others sounds scary, I assure you — the more you do it, the easier it’ll be. Go forth and get feedback on what you designed!</p>
<p class="sec" id="ch00lev1sec112"><a id="page_116"/>SECTION 3.5</p>
<p class="sec1" id="ch00lev1sec113">CODING YOUR DESIGN</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><span class="small">IF THIS BOOK INCLUDED CODE</span>, it would balloon to three times the size! But I did want to talk a bit about some coding philosophy while I have your attention.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec114"><strong>Don’t worry about being original</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">A lot of designers complain that too many websites look the same <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch03.xhtml#ch3fig16">FIGURE 3-16</a>)</strong>.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">As a beginner designer, <em>don’t worry about being 100 percent original.</em> Use what works! Sometimes the comforting familiarity could be an advantage, too.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">When you grow as a designer, you’ll get better at creating new and original details. But when you’re starting out, don’t fret if your design looks similar to another, like the beautiful (but similar layout) example sites above. No one gets hurt if your design looks similar to something else (unless you’ve used a design verbatim; don’t do that!). Remember, how your design works is more important than how it looks.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Learn the rules and trends before you break them.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch3fig16"><a id="page_117"/><img alt="image" src="../images/03fig16.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 3-16:</strong> Bootstrap is a popular design framework, meaning that a lot of websites will have similar-looking layouts. This website makes fun of the trend.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec115"><strong>Use a CSS framework</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">Professional designers and frontend developers often scoff at frameworks — most notably Bootstrap (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/5">hellobks.com/hwd/5</a></em>), but also Skeleton (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/7">hellobks.com/hwd/7</a></em>), Foundation (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/6">hellobks.com/hwd/6</a></em>), or PureCSS (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/9">hellobks.com/hwd/9</a></em>) — because they constrain your design to fit their plan, often have designs built in (so you’re not creating something unique; same complaint as above), and can bloat your code with unnecessary <span class="small">CSS</span> and JavaScript.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">But beginner designers benefit from using a framework. It will save you time futzing with <span class="small">CSS</span>, layouts, and best practices. The designed pieces that come with a lot of frameworks (such as Bootstrap) give you a good a place to start from so you don’t need to spend a ton of time designing every individual element.</p>
<p class="noindentt1"><a id="page_118"/>It’s more important in the beginning to get a design up and launched as fast as possible. You can always reduce the size of your design code and redesign elements after launch.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec116"><strong>Remember responsiveness</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">We mentioned responsiveness a few times in earlier sections, and it comes into play most when it comes time to code up your site.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Nowadays, with all sorts of devices with all sizes of screens — from tiny phone screens to giant monitors — it’s important for your design to work in multiple formats.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Look into media queries (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/89">hellobks.com/hwd/89</a></em>) so you can specify <span class="small">CSS</span> rules that only apply to one screen size.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Frameworks usually come with responsive utilities, which is another reason why I recommend them. Pay attention to what features you can use that’ll help your design, such as Bootstrap’s visible/hidden <span class="small">CSS</span> classes so you can show/hide elements depending on screen size.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">Before you launch your site, look at your design in a variety of formats and make sure the flows that you designed work on every size — your design should <em>work</em> regardless of the medium <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch03.xhtml#ch3fig17">FIGURE 3-17</a>)</strong>. Coding responsiveness takes a lot of time, but it’s important to how well your design works. Don’t forget it!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec117"><strong>Pay attention to site size</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">Beautiful images (normal <em>and</em> retina), JavaScript, framework code — before you know it, your website can be slow to download. Look at where you can trim fat by reducing the size of your CSS, images, and JavaScript: slow downloading will cause you to lose visitors <strong>(<a class="ash1" href="ch03.xhtml#ch3fig18">FIGURE 3-18</a>)</strong>.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch3fig17"><a id="page_119"/><img alt="image" src="../images/03fig17.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 3-17:</strong> Chrome DevTools (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/90">hellobks.com/hwd/90</a></em>) allows you to view your design in different sizes in your browser — no need to have the actual device to view compatibility.</p>
<div class="image" id="ch3fig18"><img alt="image" src="../images/03fig18.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><strong>FIGURE 3-18:</strong> Chrome DevTools also shows you loading times for your website, so you can see what has the potential to slow down the loading of your site.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec118"><a id="page_120"/><strong>Use analytics</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentt1">Don’t just launch a design and forget about it — look at how well it’s doing after launch. Is your bounce rate (the percentage of visitors who leave your site immediately after viewing) high? Is no one viewing your About page? Critiquing design can be hard because it’s very qualitative, relying on gut instincts and personal preference. Adding data through analytics can help you make more quantitative design decisions.</p>
<p class="noindentt1">The gold standard in analytics is Google Analytics (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/48">hellobks.com/hwd/48</a></em>), but there other analytics packages you can use instead. One option is Segment (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/49">hellobks.com/hwd/49</a></em>), which allows you to tie in other analytics services, including Google Analytics and also Mixpanel (<em><a class="green" href="http://hellobks.com/hwd/91">hellobks.com/hwd/91</a></em>), and others.</p>
<p class="line"> </p>
<p class="noindentt1">Congratulations on finishing this chapter! I’ve taken a lot of information and distilled it down into smaller, hopefully more manageable chunks. I hope at this point in the book you feel more confident about making design decisions and planning, prototyping, and building your designs.<a id="page_121"/><a id="page_122"/></p>

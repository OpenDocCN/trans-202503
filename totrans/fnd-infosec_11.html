<div class="imagel"><img alt="Image" src="../images/common.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">When you seek to protect your data, processes, and applications against concerted attacks, you’re likely to find weaknesses on the operating system that hosts all of these. The <em>operating system</em> is the software that supports the basic functionality of the device. The primary operating systems in current use are several varieties of Linux and the server and desktop operating systems offered by Microsoft and Apple. If you don’t take care to protect your operating systems, you have no basis for getting to a strong security footing.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can mitigate threats to the operating system in several ways. One of the easiest methods is <em>operating system hardening</em>, or the process of decreasing the number of openings through which an attacker might reach you. You can use this technique when you’re configuring hosts (individual computers or network devices) that might face hostile action.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_146"/>You can also add applications to your operating system designed to combat some of the tools attackers might use against you. The most common and obvious of these, particularly on internet-facing devices, are the anti-malware tools that protect you from malicious code. The software firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems discussed in earlier chapters can also block unwanted traffic or alert you when it passes through your systems.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Other security tools can detect potentially vulnerable areas on your hosts by finding services that you didn’t know were running, locating network services known to contain exploitable flaws, and generally inspecting your systems.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">By applying the concept of defense in depth and combining these efforts, you can mitigate many of the security issues on the hosts for which you’re responsible.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch11lev1sec1">Operating System Hardening</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A relatively new concept in information security, operating system hardening is a technique that aims to reduce the number of available avenues through which your operating system might be attacked. We call the sum of these areas the <em>attack surface</em>.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch11fn1" id="kch11fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> The larger your attack surface is, the greater chance an attacker has of successfully penetrating your defenses.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can decrease your attack surface in six main ways, as shown in <a href="#ch11fig1">Figure 11-1</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch11fig1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/11fig01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 11-1: The six primary means of operating system hardening</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I’ll walk you through each of these strategies.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec1"><em>Remove All Unnecessary Software</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Each piece of software installed on your operating system adds to your attack surface. If you’re seeking to harden your operating system, you should take a hard look at the software you load onto it and ensure that you’re installing the bare minimum.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you’re preparing a web server, for instance, you’ll need to install the web server software, any libraries or code interpreters needed to support the web server, and any utilities that involve the administration and maintenance of the operating system, such as backup software or remote access tools. You have no reason to install anything else.</p>&#13;
<div class="sidebar">&#13;
<p class="sidebart"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_147"/><strong>MEASURE TWICE, CUT ONCE</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Always exercise great care when making changes to operating system settings, tools, and software. Some of the changes you make could have unintended effects on the way your operating system functions, and you don’t want to learn this through experience on a machine that services a critical function. Research changes carefully before you make them.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Problems begin to arise once you install other software on the machine, even with the best of intentions. For example, let’s say that one of your developers logs into the server remotely. They need to make a change to a web page, so they install the web development software they need. Then they need to evaluate the changes, so they install their favorite web browser and the associated media plug-ins, such as Adobe Flash and Acrobat Reader, as well as a video player to test some video content. Soon, not only does the system contain software that shouldn’t be there, but the software quickly becomes outdated since it isn’t patched or updated as a result of not being officially supported and maintained by the IT department. At this point, you have a relatively serious security issue on an internet-facing machine.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec2"><em>Remove All Unessential Services</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In the same vein, you should also remove or disable unessential <em>services</em> (software that loads automatically when the system starts). Many operating systems ship with a wide variety of services to share information over the network, locate other devices, synchronize the time, allow you to access or transfer files, and perform other tasks. Various applications might also install some services to provide the tools and resources they need to function.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Attempting to turn off services can be a frustrating exercise, and it might take some experimentation. In many cases, the services’ names don’t indicate their actual function, and tracking down what each of them does may require a bit of research. One of the best ways to start is to determine the network ports on which the system is listening for network connections, as this can often give you a clue as to what might be on the back end of the open port. For instance, if the system is listening on port 80, you’re likely looking for a web server service. Many operating systems have built-in utilities that allow you to do this, such as netstat on Microsoft operating systems or Nmap, discussed in <a href="ch10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In addition to locating the devices on your networks, Nmap can allow you to determine network ports on which a given system is listening. (To install Nmap, download it from <em><a href="https://nmap.org/">https://nmap.org/</a></em>.) Run the following Nmap command in your system’s command line:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs1">nmap &lt;<span class="codeitalic1">IP address</span>&gt;</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_148"/>Replace <span class="codeitalic">&lt;IP address&gt;</span> with your device’s IP address. You’ll see results like those shown in <a href="#ch11fig2">Figure 11-2</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch11fig2"><img alt="Image" src="../images/11fig02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 11-2: Locating services using Nmap</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="#ch11fig2">Figure 11-2</a> reveals several common services running on the system, listed here:</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentintt"><strong>Port 21</strong> File Transfer Protocol (FTP), which allows files to be transferred</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentint"><strong>Port 23</strong> Telnet, which allows remote access to the device</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentint"><strong>Port 80</strong> Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which serves web content</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentintb1"><strong>Port 443</strong> Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), which serves web pages secured with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Several other ports are open as well, running services that indicate that the device in the example is a printer. You can use this information as a starting place for closing undesirable services. For example, if you didn’t intend to allow remote access to the system or serve web content, you’d want to take note of the fact that ports 21, 23, 80, and 443 are open. From there, you could attempt to reconfigure it in order to not run the unneeded services.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec3"><em>Alter Default Accounts</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Many operating systems come with standard accounts. These usually include the equivalent of a guest account and an administrator account. There might also be others, such as accounts intended for support personnel or to allow specific services or utilities to operate.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In some cases, the default accounts may come equipped with excessively liberal permissions regulating the actions they can carry out, which can cause a great deal of trouble when an informed attacker gains access to them. The default accounts might have a standard password or no password at all. If you allow these accounts to remain on the system with their default settings, attackers might be able to stroll right in and make themselves at home.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_149"/>To mitigate these security risks, you should first decide whether you need these default accounts at all and disable or remove any you won’t be using. You can usually turn off or remove guest accounts and support accounts without causing problems. In the case of administrative accounts, which often have names such as <em>administrator</em>, <em>admin</em>, or <em>root</em>, you may not be able to safely remove them from the system without causing it to malfunction, or the operating system may prevent you from doing so. However, you might be able to rename these accounts to confound attackers who attempt to make use of them. Lastly, you shouldn’t leave a default password on any account, no matter its status, since those passwords are often documented and well known.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec4"><em>Apply the Principle of Least Privilege</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">As discussed in <a href="ch03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, the principle of least privilege dictates that you should allow a party only the absolute minimum permission needed for it to carry out its function. Operating systems may put this concept into practice to varying extents.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Most modern operating systems separate tasks into those that require administrative privileges and those that don’t. In general, normal operating system users can read and write files, and perhaps execute scripts or programs, but they can do so only within a certain restricted portion of the file system. They generally can’t modify the way hardware functions, make changes to the files on which the operating system itself depends, or install software that can change or affect the entire operating system. You typically need administrative access to perform those activities.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The administrators of UNIX and Linux-like operating systems tend to strictly enforce these roles. Although the administrators could allow all users to act with the privileges of an administrator, they rarely do so. On Microsoft operating systems, the exact opposite is typically true. Administrators of a Windows operating system are typically more apt to give users administrative rights. While Microsoft has gotten better at making its operating systems usable by, and useful for, nonadministrative users, there is still a large difference in mind-set between the two camps of administrators.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you allow the average system user to regularly function with administrative privileges, you leave yourself open to a wide array of security issues. If the user executes a malware-infected file or application, they do so as the administrator, which means that the program has considerably more freedom to alter the operating system and other software installed on the host. If an attacker compromises a user’s account and that account has been given administrative rights, the attacker now has keys to the entire system. Nearly any type of attack, launched from nearly any source, will have more impact when allowed access to administrative rights on a host.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If, instead, you limit the privileges on your systems to the minimum needed in order for users to perform their required tasks, you’ll go a long way toward mitigating many security issues. In many cases, attacks will fail <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_150"/>entirely when an attacker attempts to run them from a user account with a limited set of permissions. This is a cheap and easy security measure you can put in place, and it’s simple to implement.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec5"><em>Perform Updates</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">To maintain strong security, you must perform regular and timely updates to your operating systems and applications. Researchers publish new attacks on a regular basis, and if you don’t apply the security patches released by the operating system and application vendors to mitigate those vulnerabilities, you’ll likely fall victim to attacks quickly.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To see an example of this in action, take a look at the news regarding malware propagating over the internet at any given time.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch11fn2" id="kch11fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> Many pieces of malware continue to spread by exploiting known vulnerabilities that have long since been patched by the software vendors. Although it pays to be prudent when planning to install software updates and it’s a good idea to test them thoroughly before doing so, it’s generally unwise to delay updating for long.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">One of the most crucial times to ensure that your system is properly patched is directly after you’ve finished installing it. If you connect a newly installed and completely unpatched system to your network, it may become compromised in short order, even on internal networks, because it lacks the latest patches and secure configurations. The best practice in such a situation is to download the patches onto removable media and use this media to patch the system before you connect it to a network.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec6"><em>Turn On Logging and Auditing</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Last, but certainly not least, you should configure and turn on the appropriate logging and auditing features for your system, such as those that record failed login attempts. Although the steps for configuring such services may vary slightly depending on the operating system in question and its intended use, you generally need to be able to keep an accurate and complete record of the important processes and activities that take place on your systems. You should log significant events, such as administrative privileges being exercised, users logging in to and out of the system (or failing to log in), changes made to the operating system, and similar activities.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You may also want to include additional features to supplement the tools built into the operating system for these purposes. You could install monitoring tools that alert you to issues with the system itself or anomalies that might show in the various system or application logs. You could also install supplementary logging architecture to monitor the activities of multiple machines or simply to maintain duplicate remote copies of logs outside the system to help ensure that you have an unaltered record of all activities.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">It’s also important to note that reviewing the logs is a vital part of the process. If you collect logs but never review them, you might as well not collect them at all.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch11lev1sec2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_151"/>Protecting Against Malware</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A mind-boggling amount of malware exists on the world’s networks, systems, and storage devices. Using these tools, attackers can disable systems, steal data, conduct social engineering attacks, blackmail users, and gather intelligence, among other attacks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">One particularly complex and impactful example of recent malware is Triton. First discovered in November 2017, it apparently attempted to subvert the mechanisms in industrial systems that respond to abnormal operating conditions and then potentially cause direct harm to them.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch11fn3" id="kch11fn3"><sup>3</sup></a> The device that Triton targets exists in a variety of systems, including nuclear facilities, and has the potential to cause catastrophic damage.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To protect your operating systems from malware, you can use some of the tools outlined here.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec7"><em>Anti-malware Tools</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Like the intrusion detection systems discussed in <a href="ch10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, most anti-malware applications detect threats by either matching a file to a signature or detecting unusual activities. Anti-malware tools tend to depend more heavily on signatures than on anomaly detection (often called <em>heuristics</em> in the anti-malware field), largely because signatures are easier to write and detect more reliably. The application vendor typically updates malware signatures at least once a day, or more often if the need arises, because malware changes quickly.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When a tool finds malware, it might respond by killing any associated processes and either deleting the detected files or quarantining them so that they’re not able to execute. Other times, it may simply leave the files alone. Anti-malware tools sometimes detect other security tools or files that aren’t malware, which you’ll want to leave alone and ignore in the future.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">People generally install anti-malware tools on individual systems and servers as a matter of course or to comply with a policy. You might also find them installed on proxy servers to filter malware out of the incoming and outgoing traffic. This is common on proxies for email, as malware often uses email to propagate. The tool might reject the email entirely, strip the malware out of the message body, or remove the offending attachment.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec8"><em>Executable Space Protection</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Executable space protection is a technology that prevents the operating system and applications from using certain portions of the memory to execute code. This means that classic attacks, such as buffer overflows (discussed in the “What Is a Buffer Overflow?” box on the next page), which depend on being able to execute their commands in hijacked portions of memory, may not function at all. Many operating systems also use <em>address space layout randomization (ASLR)</em>, a technique that shifts the contents of the memory in use around so that tampering with it is even more difficult.<a href="notes.xhtml#ch11fn4" id="kch11fn4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>&#13;
<div class="sidebar">&#13;
<p class="sidebart"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_152"/><strong>WHAT IS A BUFFER OVERFLOW?</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A buffer overflow attack works by inputting more data than an application is expecting—for example, by entering 10 characters into a field that was expecting only 8, as shown in <a href="#ch11fig3">Figure 11-3</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch11fig3"><img alt="Image" src="../images/11fig03.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 11-3: An example of buffer overflow</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Depending on the application, the extra two characters might be written somewhere into memory, perhaps over memory locations used by other applications or the operating system. It’s sometimes possible to execute commands by specifically crafting the excess data.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Executable space protection requires two components to function: a hardware component and a software component. The two main CPU chip manufacturers, Intel and AMD, have executable space protection components. Intel calls it the Execute Disable (XD) bit, and AMD calls it Enhanced Virus Protection.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Many common operating systems, including Microsoft’s, Apple’s, and several Linux distributions, implement the executable space protection software component.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec9"><em>Software Firewalls and Host Intrusion Detection</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">I’ve already discussed using firewalls and intrusion detection systems on the network to detect and filter out undesirable traffic. You can also add a layer of security at the host level by implementing a similar set of tools there. Although network firewalls and intrusion detection systems are usually purpose-built appliances implemented at the network, the actual functions they perform take place via specialized software resident on the devices. You can install similar software directly onto the hosts residing on your networks. In addition, using firewalls and IDS both on and off your hosts can increase your layers of security.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Properly configured software firewalls add a useful layer of security to the hosts residing on your networks. These firewalls generally contain only a subset of the features you might find on a large firewall appliance, but they’re often capable of similar packet filtering and stateful packet inspection. They can range from the relatively simple versions that are built into common operating systems to large versions, intended for use on corporate <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_153"/>networks, that include centralized monitoring and considerably more complex rules and management options.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Host-based intrusion detection systems analyze the activities on or directed at a host’s network interface. They have many of the same advantages as network-based intrusion detection systems but with a considerably reduced scope of operation. As with software firewalls, these tools may range from simple consumer models to much more complex commercial versions.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A potential flaw in centrally managed host intrusion detection systems is that, for the software to report an attack to the management mechanism in real time, the information needs to be communicated over the network. If the host in question is under attack via the same network, the software may not be able to do this. You can attempt to mitigate this issue by sending a regular beacon from the device to the management mechanism, allowing you to assume that there’s a problem if the beacon doesn’t appear, but this might not be a complete approach, as no news doesn’t always equal good news.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch11lev1sec3">Operating System Security Tools</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Many of the same tools you can use to evaluate your network security (discussed in <a href="ch10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>) can help you assess the security of your hosts. For example, you can use scanners to examine how your hosts interact with the rest of the devices on the network, or you could use vulnerability assessment tools to help point out particular areas that might contain applications or services that are vulnerable to attack—or tools already in your environment that someone might use against you to subvert your security. The tools I will discuss in this section aren’t an exhaustive list, but I’ll hit a few of the highlights.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec10"><em>Scanners</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You can use the scanning tools mentioned in <a href="ch10.xhtml">Chapter 10</a> to detect security flaws in your hosts. For example, you could look for open ports and versions of services that are running, examine banners that services display upon connection to give you information about things such as the version of the software, or examine the information your systems display over the network.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Earlier in this chapter, when I discussed operating system hardening, you learned how to use Nmap to discover ports that had services listening on them. Nmap has many uses, and it can give you considerably more information—for example, specific vendor or version information. <a href="#ch11fig4">Figure 11-4</a> shows the results of an Nmap scan directed against a network printer using the following command:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs1">nmap -sS -sU -A -v 10.0.0.121</p>&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_154"/>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch11fig4"><img alt="Image" src="../images/11fig04.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 11-4: Nmap results</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In this case, I used <code>-sS</code> to run a TCP SYN port scan and <code>-sU</code> to run a UDP port scan. I enabled OS detection, version detection, and script scanning (<code>-A</code>), and I enabled verbose output as it ran (<code>-v</code>). If you try this command, you’ll notice that it takes considerably longer to complete than the one I ran earlier.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In <a href="#ch11fig4">Figure 11-4</a>, the port listing displays several extra ports, as well as quite a bit of information about the specific services and versions that are running. The <code>http-title</code> returned tells you that this is a Brother HL-L8350CDW series printer. Armed with this information, you might have a much better chance of successfully attacking the device in question.</p>&#13;
<div class="sidebar">&#13;
<p class="sidebart"><strong>YOU FOUND A WHAT?</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">When scanning with Nmap with OS detection enabled, you may notice that it reports the device fingerprints found as running something odd or even wrong entirely. Sometimes Nmap’s OS fingerprints can be a little skewed, so it’s often best to verify the output from Nmap with another tool if something looks odd.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_155"/>In addition to the many features built into Nmap, you can create custom Nmap functionality of your own using the Nmap Scripting Engine, which is a custom language and scripting engine that enables you to add functionality to Nmap. Nmap is a capable tool with a dizzying array of switches, features, and capabilities. Fortunately, there is also a great set of documentation to refer to at <em><a href="https://nmap.org/book/man.html">https://nmap.org/book/man.html</a></em>.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec11"><em>Vulnerability Assessment Tools</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Vulnerability assessment tools, which often include many of the same features found in a tool such as Nmap, attempt to find and report network services on hosts that have known vulnerabilities.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">One such well-known scanning tool is OpenVAS (<em><a href="http://www.openvas.org/">http://www.openvas.org/</a></em>). You can use OpenVAS from the command line, but it also has a convenient graphical interface called Greenbone, shown in <a href="#ch11fig5">Figure 11-5</a>. OpenVAS can conduct a port scan on a target and then attempt to determine what services (and which versions) are running on any ports it finds open. OpenVAS will then report back with a specific list of possible vulnerabilities for a given device.</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch11fig5"><img alt="Image" src="../images/11fig05.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 11-5: The OpenVAS interface</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_156"/>OpenVAS includes a port scanner, which finds the listening services so you can identify vulnerabilities in them.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch11lev2sec12"><em>Exploit Frameworks</em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><em>Exploits</em> are small bits of software that take advantage of flaws in other software to cause them to behave in ways that their creators didn’t intend. Attackers commonly use exploits to gain access to systems or get additional privileges on those systems. As a security professional, you can also use these tools and techniques to assess the security of your own systems so that you can fix any issues before attackers find them.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">An <em>exploit framework</em> is a collection of prepackaged exploits and tools, such as network mapping tools and sniffers. These frameworks make exploits simple to use, and they give you access to a large library of them. Exploit frameworks gained popularity in the first few years of the 2000s and are still going strong. Some notable ones include Rapid7’s Metasploit (shown in <a href="#ch11fig6">Figure 11-6</a>), Immunity CANVAS, and Core Impact.</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch11fig6"><img alt="Image" src="../images/11fig06.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 11-6: The Metasploit framework</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Many exploit frameworks are graphically interfaced tools that you can run in much the same way as any other application functions. You can even configure some tools to automatically seek out and attack systems, spreading further into the network as they gain additional access.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch11lev1sec4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_157"/>Summary</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">To secure your operating systems, you can start by hardening it. Hardening involves removing all unnecessary software and services, altering the default accounts on the system, applying the principle of least privilege, updating software often, and conducting logging and auditing.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can also implement additional software to secure your operating systems. Anti-malware tools can detect, prevent, and remove malware, and you can put firewall technology to use directly on your hosts to filter out undesirable traffic as it enters or exits your network interfaces. You can also install host intrusion detection systems to detect attacks as they come at you over the network.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Finally, you can make use of a variety of security tools to find security flaws. Several scanning tools, like Nmap, can give you information about your systems and the software running on them. Vulnerability assessment tools such as OpenVAS can locate specific security flaws in your services or network-enabled software. Additionally, you can use exploit frameworks like Metasploit to attack systems to gain access to them or to elevate your privilege levels. Using some of the same techniques that attackers use can help you to find and mitigate security issues.</p>&#13;

- en: Back in the late Seventies, there was a manufacturer of home television videogames
    known as Atari. Atari’s consoles had some great games from Atari, and from dozens
    of fly-by-night companies they also had some shitty ones. By 1983, the latter
    had saturated the market, resulting in a market crash and Atari dumping well over
    half a million cartridges in a New Mexico landfill. Not only did Atari’s reputation
    suffer for these bad games, but as they were simply ROM chips on a circuit board,
    Atari was often paid no licensing fees for these crummy third-party games.

- en: As Nintendo prepared for their 1985 launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System
    (NES) in the North American market, they needed a way to avoid the same fate.
    Their solution was the Checking Integrated Circuit (CIC), a lockout chip required
    in every NES cartridge, granting Nintendo the authority to license cartridge manufacturing
    by constricting CIC supply. By having separate versions for NTSC and PAL markets,
    they could also provide for regional lockout, preventing the poor children of
    the United Kingdom from learning that in the outside world, the Teenage Mutant
    Hero Turtles were ninjas, and that the one called Michelangelo used illegal nunchucks.

- en: The scheme worked by having one CIC chip in the NES console, and another CIC
    chip in the game cartridge. Starting at reset, each of these would generate a
    stream of pseudo-random bits, and any disagreement of those bits would cause the
    console to reboot and try again.

- en: Given Nintendo’s strict control of game content, there were tempting profits
    for anyone who could manufacture games without the CIC chip. In this chapter,
    we’ll first discuss the analog circuitry that was designed to glitch out the console’s
    CIC chip, stunning it into not resetting when the expected sequence failed to
    arrive. We’ll then discuss Tengen’s reverse engineering of the CIC chip, their
    clone of it, and the open source clones that appeared in the 21st century.

    the CIC from a legitimate but cheap cartridge. One might also build a “man in
    the middle” cartridge that accepts any legitimately licensed cartridge, as a way
    to temporarily borrow its CIC.

    existed: rather than send the proper pseudo-random sequence, a cartridge might
    send a crazy pulse on the cartridge edge connector to stun the console’s CIC chip,
    with the aim of preventing that chip’s firmware from resetting the console and
    ending the game.'

    and the game continues to run until that CIC resets the console. If the CIC crashes,
    its firmware never runs and the console never resets!

- en: The best, and perhaps only, documentation for this glitching technique is Horton
    (2004). Horton describes seven different variants of the gitching circuit, manufactured
    by Camerica, Color-dreams and AVE. Each of these variants sends a negative voltage
    glitch on pin 35 or 70, which are directly wired to the CIC chip. This crashes
    the chip so that its ROM code won’t reset the CPU. [Figure 25.2](ch25.xhtml#ch25fig2)
    shows one of these cartridges, easily identified by a glitch configuration switch
    on the rear and the absence of any Nintendo seal of quality.

    resistors and protection diodes on pins 35 and 70, so that the cartridge couldn’t

    forced to either include instructions for cutting a pin of the lockout chip in
    the console or come up with something that could convincingly generate the pseudo-random
    sequence of a real CIC chip. Tengen, a subsidiary of Atari, managed to do the
    latter.

- en: The story here is mostly folklore, so please bear with me if at times I don’t
    let the truth get in the way of a good story. As I understand it, there was a
    team of three or four engineers who were reverse engineering Nintendo’s CIC chip
    by photographing its mask ROM and digging through Sharp’s documentation of the
    chip family. This team worked many late nights, and eventually came out with a
    functioning clone of the CIC chip, which Tengen packaged as their Rabbit chip,
    shown in [Figure 25.3](ch25.xhtml#ch25fig3), then later combined into a mapper
    chip known as the Rambo.^([1](footnotes.xhtml#ch25fn1))

    producing games without authorization and manufacturing even their licensed games
    in unlicensed quantities. They sued for damages in the famous case, *Atari Games
    Corp. v. Nintendo of America Inc*.

    that none of the creative portions of the work were copied, and that the reverse
    engineering was performed by clean-room methods. Unfortunately, Atari’s attorneys
    were a little too eager to earn their fees. They had requested a copy of Nintendo’s
    CIC firmware *before* they were sued by Nintendo, by lying to the copyright office
    and claiming that they had *already* been sued. Oops!'

    firmware protection was then *itself* exploited to provide a break that was just
    as good as a fresh hack of the original chip! The CIC was cloned into the Rabbit,
    then the Rabbit was cloned by forums years before the CIC itself had been publicly
    dumped.

    die photographs, but Nintendo’s original CIC chip had not been cloned except by
    Tengen. That gap was filled by Segher (2010), an excellent article sourcing images
    and ROM dumps by Neviksti, as well as a description of the Sharp SM590 architecture
    that the chip uses.

    about it. The 10-bit program counter is divided into a 1-bit field, a 2-bit page,
    and a 7-bit step. The step is counted in polynomial rather than linear order,
    as an LFSR uses fewer transistors than a linear counter! Like a PIC, the hardware
    call stack is held apart from RAM.

    Riddle (2019) documents a backdoor test mode, in which the SM590’s ROM can be
    dumped through the I/O pins.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given the pinout in [Figure 25.5](ch25.xhtml#ch25fig5), the backdoor is activated
    by lowering pins 7, 14, and 13 in that order. ROM data will then appear in 508-byte
    groups, repeating every 2,032 clock cycles on pins 12–19 and 4–1.

    be synchronized either by counting clock cycles after pin 7 is lowered, or by
    synchronizing on the long string of zeroes at the end of the dump.

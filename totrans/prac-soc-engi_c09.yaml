    frequently misdirected or ignored. In this chapter, you’ll learn about the detection,
    measurement, and reporting phases of the job. Often, part of helping your client
    organization is making yourself detectable. In the measurement phase, you should
    derive statistics about your success rates, as well as other key performance indicators.

    off an awareness program, you will likely want to be extremely stealthy or incredibly
    noisy, depending on the maturity of the organization that you’re working with
    (though the final decision is the client’s to make). A mature organization might
    be able to handle a covert operation but still want a noisy one, or it may be
    too immature to gain value from covert operations, even if the manager chooses
    that route.

    adversary could accomplish within an organization. Covert operations can set a
    good benchmark for understanding risks if the motives are good. Organizations
    that can most benefit from this are those with awareness and training programs
    already in place. Often, these engagements are best suited to be performed as
    part of an adversarial emulation campaign, such as a red team or, to a lesser
    degree, a penetration test. Running such engagements by themselves is also acceptable.

    might include working to get the site taken down and *sinkholing* the link (making
    changes to internal DNS configurations to redirect users to a safe place when
    they click it). A high open report distance value could indicate that many people
    opened the email before it was reported, which also provides less time for the

    will file it away for compliance purposes without glancing at it. If people do
    not read the report, how can they correct the findings? This section answers that
    question by looking at two angles: the deliverable report that the client should
    read and the situations that warrant that you stop what you’re doing and call
    the client.'

    client anytime human life or critical computing resources are endangered. For
    instance, if you discover a malicious actor in the client network or other unsavory
    condition that may be time sensitive, alert the client immediately.

    feel free to provide brief and incremental updates via email or phone, but be
    sure to clarify that none of the information in these informal communications
    is official. Failure to do so could land you in court if an update you provide
    contradicts the information in your report. The report should be the main, and
    ideally only, official communication between you and the client after the sales
    process is complete.

    have to dig through notes to cover everything. Borrowing some philosophy from
    Chris Sanders, author of *Practical Packet Analysis* (No Starch Press, 2017),
    your report should be clear and concise, but it should also tell a story. Using
    storytelling, you can engage readers more effectively to encourage—maybe even
    social-engineer them—into reading the report in its entirety.

- en: What do I mean by *storytelling*? Explain the steps you took and why they were
    important. Make it sound like you were acting like a real malicious actor. Talk
    about what you saw, your analysis, and the outcomes. To help you engage readers,
    use active voice instead of passive voice. For example, *the consultants successfully
    enumerated the website* is active voice. *Enumeration of the website was determined
    to be possible* is passive voice.

    Don’t use all of the allotted time for the sake of using it. Use only what you
    need to. This time should also account for document reviews (such as by editors,
    legal teams, or quality assurance).

    one from the internet, or one you make from scratch. For the purposes of this
    chapter, we’ll walk through the template found on page 187.

    reasons that the testing was performed. Include the verbiage of the engagement’s
    defined scope and statement of work in this section so that you clearly specify
    the rules you were provided and the parameters you were expected to operate within.
    This section should be no longer than a page, ideally only a paragraph or two.

    didn’t read* *(TL;DR)* portion of the report. Use this section to give a high-level
    overview of what you did, what you found, and how you assess it. You may add general
    remediation advice as well. Don’t get into the weeds here, as you should assume
    that the audience for this section is nontechnical and wants little more than
    the elevator pitch.
  prefs: []

- en: After the executive summary, include a section outlining your major findings.
    This is where you should define the top issues that should concern the client.
    Using a risk ratings system, like the one described in “Risk Ratings” on page
    129, determine which findings deserve a Critical or High-Risk rating, and include
    only those. (All other findings belong in a generic “Findings” section later in
    the document.) For each serious finding, explain what the finding is, how it can
    be exploited, what the potential outcomes are, how to test for it independently,
    and how to remediate it.Do your best to convey the severity of these findings
    to your audience. When talking to executives, I have found it useful to describe
    a risk by outlining specific negative consequences, such as ending up on the front
    page of the *New York Times* or in court, being accused of negligence. Specific
    details like these can help get the attention of executives.

    include the output from the tool you used or a screenshot of the information to
    serve as evidence. If the data is available on the public internet, you could
    also provide a link. Without the output, screenshots, or links, clients have no
    way to validate that the information you are providing is factual.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If your screenshots include sensitive, incriminating, or other damning information,
    you may consider encrypting the document while sending it to the client. I’ve
    also worked with clients who would not accept any reports digitally. They required
    the report to be mailed, to avoid e-discovery if anything associated with the
    report ends up in court. While you don’t need to label risks in this section,
    because if they are significant enough to be considered a finding, they will be
    listed and labeled in the findings section, put Critical- and High-level risks
    in a bold font to draw attention to them.

    your actual engagement. If you performed multiple kinds of social engineering,
    use subheadings to break up this section into each type of engagement: phishing,
    vishing, and onsite testing. If you are doing a hybrid engagement, meaning that
    your phishing and vishing are tied together, put them under a “Hybrid” subsection.
    Within each subsection, explain each pretext used. Discuss what you did and the
    outcomes. Then use the metrics described in “Measurement” on page 122 to help
    explain the impact of the outcomes. If you’ve previously worked with the client,
    you may also compare the findings from this engagement to the previous engagement
    so that the client can see their progress.'

    be verbose. Explain the issue, how you found it, artifacts of you finding it,
    references explaining why it is a problem, how to fully remediate it, and possible
    mitigations if full remediation is not an option. This section will reiterate
    content in the executive summary and findings sections. This is where you cohesively
    explain, in paragraph format (though occasional lists may be useful for distilling
    information) how to fix the issues you uncovered. Then finish with the remediation
    and recommendations section. Advocate for training, technical solutions, or other
    cultural changes. Part 3 of this book discusses such protections.

    any changes, and the client may or may not fix the problem. While you may feel
    a sense of ownership of the project, it’s ultimately not your problem if they
    choose not to heed your advice.

    the report before you deliver it to clients. One person should review all the
    technical aspects of the report for accuracy, while someone else should review
    it for grammar, mechanics, and prose. Your reviewers should also assess the verbosity
    of the report to ensure that it is detailed enough to convey the points appropriately,
    but not overly wordy. As Frances Saux, the editor of this book, can attest, this
    is something I struggle with. Many social engineers do. And as my publisher Bill
    Pollock pointed out, social engineers rely on their ability to talk as a point
    of strength. When working with nontechnical, non-security people, this strength
    becomes a flaw.

    but it is one of the most important aspects. Do your best to convey to management
    not only what you performed but also how the employees fared against you, along
    with actionable advice to improve.

    poorly explained or skewed data can embarrass the client, or worse, find them
    in legal trouble and you with one (or more) fewer clients.

    team sees from your engagement. They won’t see how great you were at phishing
    or vishing, and even if they did, they likely wouldn’t be as impressed by it as
    your peers in the security industry. What will impress them is a professional
    report, written in terms that they can understand, with advice that they can implement.

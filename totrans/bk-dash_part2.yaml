- en: '[Part II](part2.xhtml) will walk you through four separate applications as
    we teach you how to utilize the most common components and go over the most important
    concepts of Dash. You will also learn about several popular graphs from the Plotly
    graphing library as we explain how to visualize a variety of datasets. You will
    create an app that analyzes social media data, an app that retrieves data in real
    time, an app that explores how asset allocation affects the returns of an investment
    portfolio, and an app that visualizes machine learning models. At the end, we
    will provide you with tips and tricks that will make learning Dash and building
    your own apps even easier and more enjoyable.'

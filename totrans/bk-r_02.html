<p class="noindent">R provides a wonderfully flexible programming environment favored by the many researchers who do some form of data analysis as part of their work. In this chapter, I’ll lay the groundwork for learning and using R, and I’ll cover the basics of installing R and certain other things useful to know before you begin.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec05"><strong>1.1 Obtaining and Installing R from CRAN</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">R is available for Windows, OS X, and Linux/Unix platforms. You can find the main collection of R resources online at the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). If you go to the R project website at <em><a href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</a></em>, you can navigate to your local CRAN mirror and download the installer relevant to your operating system. <a href="app01.xhtml#app01lev1sec96">Section A.1</a> provides step-by-step instructions for installing the base distribution of R.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec06"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_4"/><strong>1.2 Opening R for the First Time</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">R is an interpreted language that’s strictly case- and character-sensitive, which means that you enter instructions that follow the specific syntactic rules of the language into a console or command-line interface. The software then interprets and executes your code and returns any results.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>R is what’s known as a</em> high-level <em>programming language.</em> Level <em>refers to the level of abstraction away from the fundamental details of computer execution. That is, a</em> low-level <em>language will require you to do things such as manually manage the machine’s memory allotments, but with a high-level language like R, you’re fortunately spared these technicalities.</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you open the base R application, you’re presented with the R console; <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch1fig1">Figure 1-1</a> shows a Windows instance, and the left image of <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch1fig2">Figure 1-2</a> shows an example in OS X. This represents R’s naturally incorporated <em>graphical user interface (GUI)</em> and is the typical way base R is used.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f01-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figt"><em><a id="ch1fig1"/>Figure 1-1: The R GUI application (default configuration) in Windows</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The functional, “no-frills” appearance of the interpreter, which in my experience has struck fear into the heart of many an undergraduate, stays true to the very nature of the software—a blank statistical canvas that can be used for any number of tasks. Note that OS X versions use separate windows for the console and editor, though the default behavior in Windows is to contain these panes in one overall R window (you can change this in the GUI preferences if desired; see <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01lev2sec06">Section 1.2.1</a>).</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_5"/><img src="../images/f01-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figt"><em><a id="ch1fig2"/>Figure 1-2: The base R GUI console pane (left) and a newly opened instance of the built-in editor (right) in OS X</em></p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>As I’ve just done, in some parts of the book I’ll refer specifically to the R GUI functionality in Windows and OS X, given these are the two platforms most often used by beginners. As well as Linux/Unix implementations, it’s possible to run R from a terminal or shell or, indeed, in the alternative</em> batch <em>mode. The vast majority of the code in this book is functional in all settings.</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec06"><strong><em>1.2.1 Console and Editor Panes</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">There are two main window types used for programming R code and viewing output. The console or command-line interpreter that you’ve just seen is where all execution takes place and where all textual and numeric output is provided. You may use the R console directly for calculations or plotting. You would typically use the console directly only for short, one-line commands.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">By default, the R <em>prompt</em> that indicates R is ready and awaiting a command is a <code>&gt;</code> symbol, after which a text cursor appears. To avoid confusion with the mathematical symbol for “greater than,” &gt;, some authors (including me) prefer to modify this. A typical choice is <code>R&gt;</code>, which you can set as follows:</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; options(prompt="R&gt; ")<br/>R&gt;</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">With the cursor placed at the prompt, you can use the keyboard up arrow (↑) and down arrow (↓) to scroll through any previously executed commands; this is useful when making small tweaks to earlier commands.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For longer chunks of code and function authoring, it’s more convenient to first write your commands in an <em>editor</em> and execute them in the console only when you’re done. There is a built-in R code editor for this purpose. The R <em>scripts</em> you write in the code editor are essentially just plain-text files with a <em>.R</em> extension.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_6"/>You can open a new instance of the editor using the R GUI menus (for example, File → New script in Windows or File → New Document in OS X).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The built-in editor features useful keystroke shortcuts (for example, <small>CTRL</small>-R in Windows or <img class="middle" src="../images/common-02.jpg" alt="image"/>-<small>RETURN</small> in OS X), which automatically send lines to the console. You can send the line upon which the cursor sits, a highlighted line, a highlighted part of a line, or a highlighted chunk of code. It’s common to have multiple editor panes open at once when working with multiple R script files; keystroke code submissions simply operate with respect to the currently selected editor.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Aesthetics such as coloring and character spacing of both the console and editor can be tailored to a certain extent depending on operating system; you simply need to access the relevant GUI preferences. <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch1fig3">Figure 1-3</a> shows the R GUI preferences in Windows (Edit → GUI preferences...) and OS X (R → Preferences...). A nice feature of the OS X version of R in particular is the code-coloring and bracket-matching features of the editor, which can improve the authoring and readability of large sections of code.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f01-03.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figt"><em><a id="ch1fig3"/>Figure 1-3: The R GUI preferences in Windows (left) and OS X (right)</em></p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec07"><strong><em>1.2.2 Comments</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In R, you can annotate your code with <em>comments</em>. Just preface the line with a hash mark (<code>#</code>), and anything that comes thereafter will be ignored by the interpreter. For example, executing the following in the console does nothing but return you to the prompt:</p>&#13;
<pre>R&gt; # This is a comment in R...</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Comments can also appear after valid commands.</p>&#13;
<pre>R&gt; 1+1 # This works out the result of one plus one!<br/>[1] 2</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you’re writing large or complicated chunks of code in the editor, this kind of annotation can be helpful to others (and indeed yourself!) who want to understand what your code is doing.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec08"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_7"/><strong><em>1.2.3 Working Directory</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">An active R session always has a <em>working directory</em> associated with it. Unless you explicitly specify a file path when saving or importing data files, R will use this working directory by default. To check the location of the working directory, use the <code>getwd</code> function.</p>&#13;
<pre>R&gt; getwd()<br/>[1] "/Users/tdavies"</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">File paths are always enclosed in double quotation marks, and R uses forward slashes, not backslashes, when specifying folder locations.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can change the default working directory using the function <code>setwd</code> as follows:</p>&#13;
<pre>R&gt; setwd("/folder1/folder2/folder3/")</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">You may provide your file path relative to the current working directory or fully (in other words, from a system root drive). Either way, it’s important to remember the case-sensitive nature of R; you must match the naming and punctuation of any folder names exactly or an error will be thrown.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">That said, if you’re happy specifying a full and correct file path each time you read or write a file (there are further details in <a href="ch08.xhtml#ch08">Chapter 8</a>), then the files of interest can reside anywhere on your computer.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec09"><strong><em>1.2.4 Installing and Loading R Packages</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The base installation of R comes ready with a plethora of built-in commands for numeric calculations, common statistical analyses, and plotting and visualization. These commands can be used right from the outset and needn’t be loaded or imported in any way. I’ll refer to these functions as <em>built-in</em> or <em>ready-to-use</em> in this text.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Slightly more specialized techniques and data sets are contained within <em>packages</em> (also referred to as <em>libraries</em>) of code. Using contributed packages is common, and you’ll be doing so throughout this book, so it’s important to get comfortable with installing and loading the required libraries.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="app01.xhtml#app01lev1sec97">Section A.2</a> covers the relevant details concerning package download and installation from CRAN, but I’ll provide a brief overview here.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch01lev3sec01"><strong>Loading Packages</strong></h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">There are a small number of recommended packages that are included with the base distribution of R (listed in <a href="app01.xhtml#app01lev2sec274">Section A.2.2</a>). They don’t need to be installed separately, but to use them, you do need to load them by calling <code>library</code>. One package you’ll use in this book is named <code>MASS</code> (<a href="ref.xhtml#ref69">Venables and Ripley, 2002</a>). To load it (or any other installed package) and gain access to its functions and data sets, simply execute <code>library</code> at the prompt as follows:</p>&#13;
<pre>R&gt; library("MASS")</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_8"/>Note that calling <code>library</code> provides access to a package’s functionality only for the running R session. When you close R and reopen a fresh instance, you’ll need to reload any packages you want to use.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch01lev3sec02"><strong>Installing Packages</strong></h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">There are thousands of contributed packages not included with the typical R installation; to make them loadable in R, you must first download and install them from a repository (usually CRAN). The easiest way to do this is by using the <code>install.packages</code> function directly at the R prompt (for this you need an Internet connection).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For example, one such package is <code>ks</code> (<a href="ref.xhtml#ref20">Duong, 2007</a>), which you’ll use in <a href="ch26.xhtml#ch26">Chapter 26</a>. Executing the following will attempt to connect to your local CRAN mirror and download and install <code>ks</code>, as well as several packages upon which it relies (called <em>dependencies</em>):</p>&#13;
<pre>R&gt; install.packages("ks")</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">The console will show running output as the procedure completes.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You need to install a package only once; thereafter it will be available for your R installation. You can then load your installed package (like <code>ks</code>) in any newly opened instance of R with a call to <code>library</code>, just as you did for <code>MASS</code>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="app01.xhtml#app01lev2sec275">Section A.2.3</a> offers more detail on package installation.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch01lev3sec03"><strong>Updating Packages</strong></h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The maintainers of contributed packages periodically provide version updates to fix bugs and add functionality. Every so often, you might want to check for updates to your collection of installed packages.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">From the R prompt, a simple execution of the following will attempt to connect to your set package repository (defaulting to CRAN), looking for versions of all your installed packages that are later than those you currently have.</p>&#13;
<pre>R&gt; update.packages()</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="app01.xhtml#app01lev1sec98">Section A.3</a> offers more details about updating packages and <a href="app01.xhtml#app01lev1sec99">Section A.4</a> discusses alternate CRAN mirrors and repositories.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec10"><strong><em>1.2.5 Help Files and Function Documentation</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">R comes with a suite of <em>help files</em> that you can use to search for particular functionality, to seek information on precisely how to use a given function and specify its <em>arguments</em> (in other words, the values or objects you supply to the function when you execute it), to clarify the role of arguments in the operations, to learn about the form of any returned objects, to provide possible examples of using the function, and to get details on how you may cite any software or data sets.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_9"/>To access the help file for a given command or other object, use the <code>help</code> function at the console prompt or use the convenient shortcut <code>?</code>. For example, consider the ready-to-use arithmetic mean function, <code>mean</code>.</p>&#13;
<pre>R&gt; ?mean</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">This brings up the file in the top image of <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch1fig4">Figure 1-4</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f01-04.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figt"><em><a id="ch1fig4"/>Figure 1-4: The R help file for the function</em> <code>mean</code> <em>(top) and the results of a help search for the string</em> <code>"mean"</code> <em>(bottom) in OS X</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_10"/>If you’re unsure of the precise name of the desired function, you can search the documentation across all installed packages using a character string (a statement in double quotes) passed to <code>help.search</code>, or you can use <code>??</code> as a shortcut:</p>&#13;
<pre>R&gt; ??"mean"</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">This search brings up a list of functions, with their host packages and descriptions, whose help files contain the string of interest, as shown in the bottom image of <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch1fig4">Figure 1-4</a> (the highlighted entry is that of the arithmetic mean).</p>&#13;
<p class="indentb">All help files follow the general format shown in the top image of <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch1fig4">Figure 1-4</a>; the length and level of detail in the file typically reflect the complexity of the operations carried out by the function. Most help files include the first three items listed here; the others are common but optional:</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• The <em>Description</em> section provides a short statement about the operations carried out.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• The <em>Usage</em> section specifies the form of the function in terms of how it should be passed to the R console, including the natural order of the arguments and any default values (these are the arguments that are shown being set using <code>=</code>).</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• In the <em>Arguments</em> section, more detail is given about what each argument does as well as the possible values that they’re allowed to take on.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• The nature of the object that’s returned by the function (if anything) is specified under <em>Value</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• The <em>References</em> section provides relevant citations for the command or the methodology behind the function.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• The help files for related functions are linked under <em>See Also</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• <em>Examples</em> provides executable code that you can copy and paste into the console, demonstrating the function in action.</p>&#13;
<p class="indentt">There are several more possible fields in a help file—functions with longer explanations often contain a <em>Details</em> section after the <em>Arguments</em> section. Common traps or mistakes made when calling the function are usually placed in a <em>Warnings</em> section, and additional information can be placed in <em>Notes</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Although they might seem quite technical when you’re first starting out, I encourage you to keep looking at help files—even if you already know how a function works, getting comfortable with the layout and interpretation of function documentation is an important part of becoming a skilled R user.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec11"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_11"/><strong><em>1.2.6 Third-Party Editors</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The popularity of R has led to the development of several third-party code editors, or compatible plug-ins for existing code-editing software, which can enhance the experience of coding in R.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">One noteworthy contribution is RStudio (<a href="ref.xhtml#ref56">RStudio Team, 2015</a>). This is an integrated development environment (IDE) available free for Windows, OS X, and Linux/Unix platforms at <em><a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">http://www.rstudio.com/</a></em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">RStudio includes a direct-submission code editor; separate point-and-click panes for things such as file, object, and project management; and the creation of markup documents incorporating R code. <a href="app02.xhtml#app02">Appendix B</a> discusses RStudio and its capabilities in more detail.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Use of any third-party editor, including RStudio, is by and large a personal choice. In this book, I simply assume use of the typical base R GUI application.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec07"><strong>1.3 Saving Work and Exiting R</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">So, you’ve spent a few hours coding in R, and it’s time to go home? When saving work in R, you need to pay attention to two things: any R objects that have been created (and stored) in the active session and any R script files written in an editor.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec12"><strong><em>1.3.1 Workspaces</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You can use the GUI menu items (for example, under File in Windows and under Workspace in OS X) to save and load <em>workspace image</em> files. An R workspace image contains all the information held in the R session at the time of exit and is saved as a <em>.RData</em> file. This will include all objects you’ve created and stored (in other words, <em>assigned</em>) within the session (you’ll see how to do this in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>), including those that may have been loaded from a previous workspace file.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Essentially, loading a stored <em>.RData</em> file allows you to “pick up from where you left off.” At any point in an R session, you can execute <code>ls()</code> at the prompt, which lists all objects, variables, and user-defined functions currently present in the active workspace.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Alternatively, you can use the R commands <code>save.image</code> and <code>load</code> at the console for handling workspace <em>.RData</em> files—both of these functions contain a <code>file</code> argument to which you pass the folder location and name of the target <em>.RData</em> file (see the corresponding help files <code>?save.image</code> and <code>?load</code> for further information on the use of these).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Note that saving a workspace image in this way doesn’t retain the functionality of any contributed packages that were loaded in the previously active R session. As mentioned in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01lev2sec09">Section 1.2.4</a>, you’ll need to use <code>library</code> to load any packages required for your work for each new instance of R.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_12"/>The quickest way to exit the software is to enter <code>q()</code> at the prompt:</p>&#13;
<pre>R&gt; q()</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Simply exiting the console will bring up a dialog asking if you’d like to save the workspace image. In this case, choosing to save doesn’t open a file browser to name your file but creates (or overwrites) a “no-name” file as one with a <em>.RData</em> extension in your working directory (refer to <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01lev2sec08">Section 1.2.3</a>).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If an unnamed <em>.RData</em> file exists in the default working directory when a new instance of R is opened, the program will automatically load that default workspace—if that has happened, you’ll be notified in the console’s welcoming text.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>Alongside the</em> .RData <em>file, R will automatically save a file containing a line-by-line history of all the commands executed in the console for the associated workspace in the same directory. It’s this history file that allows you to scroll through the previously executed commands using the keyboard directional arrows, as noted earlier.</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec13"><strong><em>1.3.2 Scripts</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">For tasks requiring anything more than a handful of commands, you’ll usually want to work in the built-in code editor. Saving your R scripts is therefore at least as important as saving a workspace, if not more so.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You save editor scripts as plain-text files with a <em>.R</em> extension (noted in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01lev2sec06">Section 1.2.1</a>); this allows your operating system to associate these files with the R software by default. To save a script from the built-in editor, ensure the editor is selected and navigate to File → Save (or press <small>CTRL</small>-S in Windows or <img class="middle" src="../images/common-02.jpg" alt="image"/>-S in OS X). To open a previously saved script, select File → Open script... (<small>CTRL</small>-O) in Windows or File → Open Document... (<img src="../images/common-02.jpg" alt="image"/>-O) in OS X.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Often, you won’t really need to save a workspace <em>.RData</em> file if your script files are saved. Once any required commands in a saved script are reexecuted in a new R console, the objects created previously (in other words, those contained within a saved <em>.RData</em> file) are simply created once more. This can be useful if you’re working on multiple problems at one time because it can be easy to mistakenly overwrite an object when relying solely on the stand-alone default workspace. Keeping your collection of R scripts separate is therefore a simple way to separate several projects without needing to worry about overwriting anything important that may have been stored previously.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">R also provides a number of ways to write individual objects, such as data sets and image files of plots, to disk, which you’ll look at in <a href="ch08.xhtml#ch08">Chapter 8</a>.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec08"><strong>1.4 Conventions</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">There are a few conventions that I’ll follow in the book in terms of the presentation of code and math.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec14"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_13"/><strong><em>1.4.1 Coding</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindentb">As mentioned, when you code with R, you execute the code in the console, possibly after writing the script in the editor first. The following points are important to note:</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• R code that’s entered directly into the console for execution is shown preceded by the <code>R&gt;</code> prompt and followed by any output displayed in the console. For example, this simple division of 14 by 6 from <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02lev2sec17">Section 2.1.1</a> looks like this:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs-b">R&gt; 14/6<br/>[1] 2.333333</p>&#13;
<p class="bullpi">If you want to copy and paste console-executed code directly from the text of the book, you’ll need to omit the <code>R&gt;</code> prompt.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• For code that should be written in the editor before it’s executed in the console, I’ll indicate as such in the text, and the code will be presented <em>without</em> the prompt. The following example comes from <a href="ch10.xhtml#ch10lev2sec92">Section 10.2.1</a>:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs-b">for(myitem in 5:7){<br/>    cat("--BRACED AREA BEGINS--\n")<br/>    cat("the current item is",myitem,"\n")<br/>    cat("--BRACED AREA ENDS--\n\n")<br/>}</p>&#13;
<p class="bullpi">My preferred coding style for actually arranging and indenting chunks like this will become clearer as you progress through <a href="part02.xhtml#part02">Part II</a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• There will occasionally be long lines of code (either executed directly in the console or written in the editor), which, for the sake of print, will be split and indented at an appropriate place to fit on the page. For example, take this line from <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06lev2sec60">Section 6.2.2</a>:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs-b">R&gt; ordfac.vec &lt;- factor(x=c("Small","Large","Large","Regular","Small"),<br/>                        levels=c("Small","Regular","Large"),<br/>                        ordered=TRUE)</p>&#13;
<p class="bullpi">Although this can be written out as a single line when using R, you can also break the line at a comma (in this case, the comma splits the arguments to the <code>factor</code> function). The broken line will be indented to the level of the opening parenthesis of the relevant command. Both forms—single line or split—will work as is when executed in R.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• Lastly, in a couple of places when the console output is lengthy and not essential to your understanding of the immediate content, it’ll be suppressed for the sake of print. I’ll say as much in the text, and you’ll see the designation <code>--<span class="codeitalic">snip</code>--</span> in the affected chunk of code.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec15"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_14"/><strong><em>1.4.2 Math and Equation References</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Mathematics and equations that appear in this book (mainly in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Parts III</a> and <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">IV</a>) will be kept to a minimum, but in certain sections it’s sometimes necessary to go into a little mathematical detail.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Important equations will be presented on their own lines as follows:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><a id="ch1eq1"/><img src="../images/e1-1.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indentb">Equations will be numbered in parentheses, and references to equations in the text will use these parenthesized numbers and may or may not be preceded by <em>Equation</em>. For example, you’ll see equations referred to in both of the following ways:</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• As per <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch1eq1">Equation (1.1)</a>, <em>y</em> = 8 when <em>x</em> = 2.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• Inversion of (1.1) yields <em>x</em> = <em>y</em>/4.</p>&#13;
<p class="indenttb">When numeric results are rounded to a certain level, they’ll be noted as such according to the number of <em>decimal places</em>, abbreviated to <em>d.p.</em> Here are some examples:</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• The famous geometric value pi is given as <em>π</em> = 3.1416 (rounded to 4 d.p.).</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• Setting <em>x</em> = 1.467 in (1.1) results in <em>y</em> = 5.87 (2 d.p.).</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec16"><strong><em>1.4.3 Exercises</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Exercise questions in the chapters appear in a rounded box:</p>&#13;
<div class="ex">&#13;
<p class="ext"><a id="ch1exc1"/><strong>Exercise 1.1</strong></p>&#13;
<ol type="a">&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">Say the word <em>cat</em> aloud.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindents">Using nothing but your brain, find the solution to 1 + 1.</p></li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">These exercises are optional. If you choose to tackle them, they are intended to be completed as and when they appear in the text to help you practice and understand the specific content and code in the sections that immediately precede them.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">All the data sets you’ll use in this book for coding and plotting examples are available either as built-in R objects or as part of one of the contributed packages you’ll install. These packages will be noted in the relevant text (for a short list of them, see <a href="app01.xhtml#app01lev2sec275">Section A.2.3</a>).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For your convenience, all code examples in this book, as well as complete suggested solutions to <em>all</em> practice exercises, are freely available as runnable <em>.R</em> script files on the book’s web page at <em><a href="https://www.nostarch.com/bookofr/">https://www.nostarch.com/bookofr/</a></em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_15"/>You should think of these solutions (and any accompanying commentary) as “suggested” because there are often multiple ways to perform a certain task in R, which may not necessarily be any better or worse than those supplied.</p>&#13;

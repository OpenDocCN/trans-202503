    allow for the assignment of data types. There’s no underlying egalitarian ethos
    at play, but all Batch variables are created equal. Intrinsically, there’s no
    difference between a variable holding a number, text, or even a boolean. However,
    a variable set to a number can be treated as numeric, and I’ll focus on those
    data types in the next chapter.

    nihilo the first time the interpreter discovers a new variable name. This practice
    does allow for a great deal of flexibility, but it can be tricky and dangerous.
    One misspelled instance of a variable name used a dozen times is considered to
    be an entirely different variable by the interpreter, and the mistake will not
    be caught by the guiding hand of a compiler. Instead, it’s treated as a new variable
    that’ll likely resolve to nothing.

    a string, but on the upside, a number can easily be treated as a string without
    any type of conversion when written to the console or a report. It’s pure digital

    way of determining the length of a string with no fear of the null pointer exceptions
    prevalent in compiled code. If the 36th byte equals null (that is, "%aString:~35,1%"

    is 36 bytes or longer. But if the string is empty or set to null, %aString:~35,1%
    resolves to ~35,1, or everything between the colon and trailing delimiter. Likewise
    due to this batveat, when trying to inspect the last byte of an empty string,

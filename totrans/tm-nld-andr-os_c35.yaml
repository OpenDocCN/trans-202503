- en: In late 2009, a year after 1.0 shipped, Android institutionalized extra working
    hours by starting the tradition of *Bacon Sundays*. Previously, people would simply
    be at work all the time. But eventually, people started spending weekend time
    *not* working. But Android still had the same do-or-die dynamic as it did before
    (albeit with more people to handle the load). Release deadlines were critical;
    they *had* to hit those dates. So toward the end of a release, management encouraged
    people to come to the office on Sunday morning with the promise of a big breakfast
    buffet spread (along with plenty of work). Participation wasn’t required, and
    not everybody came in on those Sundays. But there was an understanding that there
    was a lot of work to do, and a team effort would help.

    were probably behind our fourth schedule—and that was a Big Deal. There was a
    big launch, with a lot of marketing behind it, so we were like ‘Shit, what do
    we do? Gotta come in on weekends and make it happen.’

    so bacon probably was not the best choice. I don’t eat it that much anymore. Turns
    out it’s not good for your health.

    time was to work on weekends. So Sundays—not every Sunday—but in the summer it
    became kind of a . . . in retrospect, kind of a sad tradition.”

    earlier than that, breakfast or no), there would be a full, catered spread with
    brunch goodies, including a large tray of bacon. People wandered into the cafeteria,
    ate their fill and caught up with co-workers, then headed to their desks to continue
    working on the product.

- en: Bacon Sundays went away by the time the team shipped KitKat, in the Fall of
    2013\. The team had grown, so there were simply more people available to help
    hit the deadlines. Also, the releases were not as frequent as they were in the
    early days, so there wasn’t as much constant schedule panic. Finally, management
    recognized that enough was enough, and people wanted their weekend lives back.

    We’ll begin by exploring how to add photos to your computer from a camera or phone,
    and then you’ll see how to view and edit your images. We’ll finish this lesson
    with printing your photos so you can share them with friends or put them in a
    frame!

- en: The Photos app makes it easy to manage your digital photos. Digital photos are
    found everywhere in modern life—and for good reason! Unlike with traditional photo
    albums, you can store hundreds, even thousands of photos in an orderly and easily
    managed fashion, without taking up space in your home. Digital photos mean there’s
    no waste, and because you’re not using film, you can take as many photos as will
    fit on your camera’s or phone’s memory—which tends to be thousands! You just take
    as many photos as you want and then look at the digital files of these photos
    to decide which ones you want to keep, which to print, and which to delete to
    free up space for even more photos.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can also do much more with digital photos than you can with film photographs.
    With the Photos app, you can improve, fix, and edit your photos; you can rotate
    photos to the correct orientation; and you can crop photos to remove objects.
    When you’re happy with your photos, you can print as many copies as you like to
    share with friends and family, or send digital copies for people to receive instantly
    (we’ll look at emailing picture files in [Lesson 4](ch4.xhtml#ch4)).

    camera or phone. This is wonderfully easy, but it only works for digital photos,
    not older hard-copy photos that have been developed using film. However, if you
    do have a large collection of film photos, there is a way to create a digital
    version of them to use with the Photos app: you need to scan them with a *scanner*,
    which is an external device that basically creates a digital copy of the photo.
    Scanners are quite cheap to buy, and many public libraries will have one. To make
    things even easier, your computer has a Scan app. To find out more about how to
    connect a scanner, see “[Connecting a Printer, Scanner, Webcam, or Other Device](app01.xhtml#app01)”
    on [page 293](app01.xhtml#page_293).'
  prefs: []

- en: Another quick way to digitize print photos is simply to take a picture of them
    using a phone or digital camera. This is an easy way to share older photos with
    friends and family online, although the quality of the picture may not be high
    enough to make new prints.

    appear in the Photos app without your needing to add them! In this case, you can
    skip ahead to “[Viewing a Photo](ch3.xhtml#toc_lev67)” on [page 80](ch3.xhtml#page_80).
    But if you’ve taken photos on your phone or digital camera, you need to add them
    to your computer before you can work with them in the Photos app.

    and phones will come with a cable, called a *USB cable*, to allow you to do this.
    The cable will look something like the one shown in the following figures and
    will have a small rectangular plug on one end and a larger rectangular plug on
    the other. Once you’ve found the cable for your phone or camera, follow these
    steps:'

    on a separate device. If your camera or phone doesn’t seem to be connecting, look
    at its screen and see if there are any instructions. Check your camera’s manual

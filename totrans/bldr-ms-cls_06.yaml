- en: The addition of sculpting tools to Blender’s arsenal has vastly broadened the
    range of creations possible and the level of detail we can add to our creations.
    In addition, sculpting allows for much more freedom in the route taken to create
    a model; prior to its introduction, we had to labor to create topology to support
    each element of a model. Now, with sculpting, we can start from a much simpler
    mesh, use multiresolution subdivision to provide the level of control necessary
    to support the forms we want, and worry about the topology later.

    to use Sculpt mode. We’ll look at customizing the appearance of Sculpt mode and
    the tools you can use to get the most out of Blender when sculpting. Then, we’ll
    move on to using these tools to start sculpting on the base meshes we created
    in [Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Blocking In"), taking them from simple, low-res
    base meshes to highly detailed, sculpted models. Finally, we’ll look at some general
    principles for sculpting.

    been set up to make sculpting easier—you use Blender’s GLSL shading and enable
    Only Render to display only objects that will be rendered. This keeps the grid
    and any superfluous objects in your scene, such as lamps and cameras, out of your
    way while sculpting. We will cover these settings in more depth in [Customizing

    sure to keep the strength of this brush low or it can do some damage. Also, be

    will affect a large percentage of faces in the base mesh (at least one-sixth),
    making it slower for Blender to update its shape. By subdividing first, each stroke
    will affect a much smaller percentage of faces in the base mesh, so there is less

    Simple subdivision 1. However, instead of being purely procedural, the Multires
    modifier will store further editing of your mesh in Sculpt mode, allowing you
    to first subdivide your mesh and then use the extra geometry this creates to sculpt
    in extra detail. This lets us subdivide a fairly basic model into millions of

    we want.

    rough shape of your subject; in other words, create a rough volume for each component
    of your overall figure. When sculpting a character, you should block out the volumes
    of the legs, arms, torso, head, hands, and feet. This is accomplished partly by
    creating a good base mesh. For example, we already created the basic shape of
    the Bat Creature character in [Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Blocking In");

    feel for the size and overall shape of the model.'

    forms from one body part to another. This stage applies more to posed characters
    but is an important part of creating a good neutral pose, and even applies when
    sculpting inorganic forms. Key at this stage is that the forms of the body are
    connected by smooth, flowing curves. You should usually be able to draw a smooth
    curve through your character’s pose, as shown in [Figure 6-16](ch06.html#try_to_establish_smooth_curves_that_flow

    the object into flat planes—areas of the object that form broadly flat surfaces
    rather than polygons. The direction and placement of the planes in your sculpture
    determine how the surfaces of your objects catch light, creating patterns that
    in turn play a large part in how we read and recognize shapes.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Even though you’ll ultimately smooth out these planes, they’ll still influence
    your finished object. For example, the planes in a human or humanoid character
    are largely defined by the object’s major anatomical landmarks, such as the bony
    parts of the skull, ribcage, collar bones, and pelvis. In [Figure 6-17](ch06.html#planes_of_the_headdot_you_donapostrophet
    "Figure 6-17. The planes of the head. You don’t need to define planes to this
    extent, but keep them in mind."), the main large planes are defined by the shape
    of the skull; these planes include those along the side of the head, along the
    jawline and chin, and down the bridge of the nose. Smaller secondary planes form
    the shapes of the ears, lips, and nostrils. (You don’t actually need to define
    the planes of your model too rigorously, as they will be smoothed out later, but
    it is important to know and roughly mark in where they are.)

    of the anatomical detail you may have added will need to be toned down. You can
    either omit these details earlier in the sculpting process (but consider where
    they will be under the surface nonetheless) or smooth them away in areas where
    you need a subtler effect. Finally, you can start adding smaller details, like

    the pose and then began adjusting the body. For example, to move a leg, I selected
    all the vertices in the leg, placed the 3D cursor where the hip joint would be,
    and then rotated the leg about that point using proportional editing to create
    a smooth transition. This is a quick and dirty way to pose a character without
    resorting to rigging it, which is a complex task—and for a still render, more
    effort than it’s worth.

    major forms with the Clay and Grab brushes, then refining planes and adding details.
    However, in the case of the Spider, I had the added complexity of trying to create
    hard-surface forms. While you could model these sorts of forms directly (often
    an excellent approach), sculpting some aspects of hard-surface forms allowed me
    to be more experimental when creating our model.

    you can accomplish a lot with the Flatten and Polish brushes along with the Pinch
    and Crease brushes. Then you can use retopology to create a finalized model with
    clean, smooth forms. By focusing on forms first and topology later, you reduce
    the hassle of trying to model forms you are not yet sure about and get your objects
    curving smoothly with clean topology later.

    make corners and edges sharper. Then, pinch them together to get a really sharp
    crease. By steering clear of the edges and using the Flatten brushes on the flat
    areas, you can achieve a fairly polished result. (Don’t go crazy; we’ll use retopology
    later to create a new mesh with smoother forms.)

    strategies. For open mouths, the Inflate and Smooth brushes are useful for adjusting
    the shape of the lips and the surrounding areas. For closed mouths, the Crease
    brush is perfect for drawing in the crease between the two lips, followed by filling
    out the surrounding areas with the Clay and Clay Tubes brushes. Remember that
    the upper lip generally has much more definition than the lower lip and has a

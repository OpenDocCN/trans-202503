    split into two and flowed around either side of the town.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    suit and a black shirt. The other had a bright black suit and a white shirt.

- en: '*Maybe they’ll ask me a riddle*, Laurie thought. *Or I’ll need to figure out
    which one is a liar and which one tells the truth!* Laurie had read a lot of fairy
    tales, you see. She believed she was figuring out how this place worked.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Name?” asked one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Laurie Ipsum.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Password?” asked the other.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Why, I don’t know the password,” Laurie said.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Then you may not enter!” the boys said in unison.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “That’s not much of a riddle.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “A riddle? Ha ha, no, begging your pardon, miss. That’s not how it works. There
    are no riddles, no bets, no liars, and no truth-tellers. We’ve read those books
    too, haven’t we, Tollens?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Yes, we have, Ponens. There’s none of that mythic fairy-tale stuff in our System,
    miss. Word games and clever riddles, ha! That’s just bad security!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “But that’s not fair!” cried Laurie. “How do I get inside?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “It’s very simple,” said Ponens. “If you have a password, then that means you
    can pass through the semantic turnstile.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “If you can’t pass through the turnstile, then that means you don’t have a password.
    It’s only logical,” Tollens said. “Do you have a password?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “No, I don’t know what it is,” Laurie said.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Then you may not enter!” they said again, together.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Can you give me a hint?” Laurie was sure she could guess the password, given
    some kind of clue.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Yes, hints are part of the System,” said Ponens.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Oh, good.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Did you set up a hint with your account?” asked Tollens.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Well, no,” she said. “This is my first time here.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Then it’s hard luck for you, miss,” said Ponens. “Once you are inside, do make
    sure to set up a hint for the next time.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “And remember to change your password to something memorable, but hard to guess,”
    said Tollens. “It’s just good security.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “But I’m trying to *get* inside! I don’t know what to do!”

    can pass through the semantic turnstile.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “And if you can’t pass through the turnstile, then that means you don’t have
    a password. It’s only logical,” Tollens said.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “That’s not completely true, is it?” Laurie said. “What if the turnstile is
    broken? I wouldn’t be able to enter even if I had a password.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Um . . .” Tollens looked a little unsure of himself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Or what if I fooled you into *believing* I had the password, even if I didn’t?
    Then I could enter without it.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Hmm.” Ponens considered Laurie’s argument, trying to find a flaw.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Laurie rushed on. “Or what if I had the password, but I didn’t want to give
    it to you?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “No, you still couldn’t encroach on our premises,” Ponens said with more confidence.
    “You have to give us a password that matches the name you give us.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Is it ‘Laurie’?” she guessed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “No!” they shouted together.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Is it ‘November First’?” That was Laurie’s birthday.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “No!” they shouted again.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Only one try left, miss,” said Tollens.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Oh, no! Really?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “You can try only so many times. It’s just good security.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Do I even have an account?” she wondered.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “We can’t confirm or deny that,” answered Ponens. “That would be bad security.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Do I . . . *not* have an account?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “We can’t deny or confirm that, either!” answered Tollens.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “It’s very simple—” began Ponens.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “—yes, yes,” Laurie interrupted. “If I have it, I know it, but if I don’t, you
    can’t tell me. And you can give me a hint only if I set it up earlier!” This certainly
    was very good security. *Think, Laurie, think!*
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Okay, let’s start over,” she said.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Very well, miss,” said Tollens. “Name?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I told you, it’s Lau—” she stopped herself. “Actually . . . my name is Eponymous
    Bach.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Password?” said Ponens.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*It couldn’t be that simple, could it?*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Bach’s Password.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Welcome!” said Ponens and Tollens, waving her through the turnstile.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course Bach would name her password after herself!

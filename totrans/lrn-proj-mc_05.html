<div class="image1"><img src="graphics/common01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="noindent">You ask yes-or-no questions all the time: Is it raining? Is my hair too long? Once you know whether the answer is yes or no, you can decide what to do next: bring an umbrella, or not; trim your hair, or not. In all these situations, what you do depends on whether the answer to the question is yes or no. Deciding what to do based on the answer to a question is also important in programming. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to ask questions in Python.</p>
<p class="indent">In programming, the questions you ask are usually about comparing values. Is one value equal to another? Is a value bigger or smaller than another? The yes-or-no question is called a <em>condition</em>, and the answer isn’t <em>yes</em> or <em>no</em> but <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. Say you ask the question “Do I have more gold blocks than my friend?” or, in other words, “Is my gold stash greater than my friend’s gold stash?” To make that question into a condition that Python can understand, we have to phrase it as a statement (such as “My gold stash is greater than my friend’s”) that can be true or false.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_82"/>Testing whether a condition is true or false is so useful in Python that there’s a special data type just for storing the values <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>. So far you’ve seen a few other data types: integer, float, and string data types. The data type that stores <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> values is the <em>Boolean</em> data type. Booleans can only be <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. When you use Python to ask questions, the result is either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. When a condition is true or false, programmers say that it <em>evaluates to</em> <code>True</code> or <em>evaluates to</em> <code>False</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">In this chapter you’ll use Booleans, comparison operators, and logical operators to test different conditions involving values. Then you’ll be ready for <a href="ch06.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>, where you’ll use the answers to questions to make decisions about what to do next in a program.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec01"><strong><span class="blue">BOOLEAN BASICS</span></strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">A Boolean is a bit like a light switch: it is either <code>True</code> (on) or <code>False</code> (off). In Python, you can declare a Boolean variable like this to represent that the light is on:</p>
<p class="programs">light = <span class="orange">True</span></p>
<p class="indent">Here you assign the value <code>True</code> to the variable <code>light</code>. To turn the light off, you could assign the value <code>False</code> to light:</p>
<p class="programs">light = <span class="orange">False</span></p>
<p class="indent">Always capitalize the first letter of <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>. If you don’t, Python won’t recognize the value as a Boolean and will throw an exception instead of evaluating your calculation!</p>
<p class="indent">In the next mission, you’ll use Booleans to stop the player from smashing blocks in the game world.</p>
<h4 class="h4a" id="ch05lev2sec01"><strong>MISSION #17: STOP SMASHING BLOCKS!</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">In Minecraft, it’s easy to smash blocks, which is great when you want to mine for resources. But it’s annoying to spend ages building a really cool structure and then accidentally smash and destroy it! In this mission, you’ll make your Minecraft world indestructible.</p>
<p class="indent">By using <code>setting("world_immutable", True)</code> you can make blocks <em>immutable</em>, which means they can’t be changed. The <code>setting()</code> line of code is a function like the <code>setTilePos()</code> and <code>setPos()</code> functions you’ve seen. <a href="ch05.html#ch5ex1">Listing 5-1</a> shows how to make the world immutable.</p>
<p class="sidenote"><span class="blue"><em>immutableOn.py</em></span></p>
<p class="programs"><span class="orange">from</span> mcpi.minecraft <span class="orange">import</span> Minecraft<br/>mc = Minecraft.create()<br/><br/>mc.setting(<span class="green">"world_immutable"</span>, <span class="orange">True</span>)</p>
<p class="examplet"><a id="ch5ex1"/><em>Listing 5-1: Code that stops blocks from being broken</em></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_83"/>The <code>setting()</code> function has options that you can set to <code>True</code> to turn them on. One of the options is <code>"world_immutable"</code>. To turn a <code>setting()</code> option on, you write <code>True</code> after the name of the setting inside the parentheses.</p>
<p class="indent">Type <a href="ch05.html#ch5ex1">Listing 5-1</a> into IDLE and save it as <em>immutableOn.py</em> in a new folder called <em>booleans</em>. When you run it, you shouldn’t be able to smash most blocks, as shown in <a href="ch05.html#ch5fig1">Figure 5-1</a>. But what happens when you <em>do</em> want to break blocks again? Copy your program into a new file and change it to allow the player to smash blocks. (Hint: Use a Boolean!) Save the new file as <em>immutableOff.py</em> in the <em>booleans</em> folder.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="graphics/f05-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch5fig1"/><em>Figure 5-1: No matter how hard I try, the block won’t break!</em></p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec02"><strong><span class="blue">CONCATENATING BOOLEANS</span></strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Like integers and floats, Booleans must be converted to strings before they can be concatenated. For example, you concatenate Booleans and strings when you want to output Booleans using the <code>print()</code> function. To do this, use the <code>str()</code> function:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> agree = <span class="orange">True</span><br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"I agree: "</span> + <span class="rose">str</span>(agree))<br/><span class="blue1">I agree: True</span></p>
<p class="indent">The <code>agree</code> variable stores a Boolean. It is converted to a string on the second line with <code>str(agree)</code>, concatenated to the <code>"I agree: "</code> string, and printed.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec03"><strong><span class="blue">COMPARATORS</span></strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">You are very good at comparing values. You know that 5 is greater than 2, 8 and 8 are the same number, and 6 and 12 are not the same number. A computer is also good at comparing values; you just need to tell it exactly <a id="page_84"/>which kind of comparison you want by typing in a symbol called a <em>comparator</em>. For example, do you want it to check if one value is bigger than the other, or do you want it to check if it’s smaller?</p>
<p class="indentb">Comparators (or <em>comparison operators</em>) in Python let you compare data. Python uses six comparators:</p>
<p class="bull">• Equal to (<code>==</code>)</p>
<p class="bull">• Not equal to (<code>!=</code>)</p>
<p class="bull">• Less than (<code>&lt;</code>)</p>
<p class="bull">• Less than or equal to (<code>&lt;=</code>)</p>
<p class="bull">• Greater than (<code>&gt;</code>)</p>
<p class="bull">• Greater than or equal to (<code>&gt;=</code>)</p>
<p class="indentt">Each comparator returns a Boolean value (<code>True</code> or <code>False</code>) that states whether the condition has been met. Let’s look at these comparators and explore how to use them!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch05lev2sec02"><strong><span class="blue">EQUAL TO</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">When you want to find out whether two values are the same, you can use the equal to comparator (<code>==</code>). When the values are the same, the comparison returns the Boolean value <code>True</code>. When the values are different, the comparison returns <code>False</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, let’s assign the value of two variables and then use the equal to operator to compare them:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> length = 2<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> width = 2<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> length == width<br/><span class="blue1">True</span></p>
<p class="indent">The result is <code>True</code> because the values of the <code>length</code> and <code>width</code> variables are the same.</p>
<p class="indent">But if they are different, the result is <code>False</code>:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> length = 4<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> width = 1<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> length == width<br/><span class="blue1">False</span></p>
<p class="indent">You can use the equal to comparator on all variable types: strings, integers, floats, and Booleans.</p>
<p class="indent">Notice how I used <code>==</code> to compare <code>length</code> and <code>width</code> instead of <code>=</code>, which is used to set a variable. Python uses the <code>==</code> operator to tell the difference between a comparison (asking whether two values are equal) and setting a variable (making a variable equal some value). Try to remember this difference to avoid bugs in your code. Don’t worry; even I make the mistake of using <code>=</code> instead of <code>==</code> once in a while!</p>
<h4 class="h4a" id="ch05lev2sec03"><a id="page_85"/><strong>MISSION #18: AM I SWIMMING?</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ll use comparators to make a program that states whether or not you’re standing in water. The results will be posted to Minecraft chat.</p>
<p class="indent">To find out the block type at certain coordinates, you’ll use the <code>getBlock()</code> function. This function takes coordinates as three arguments and returns the block type as an integer. For example:</p>
<p class="programs">blockType = mc.getBlock(10, 18, 13)</p>
<p class="indent">Here, I stored the result of <code>mc.getBlock(10, 18, 13)</code> in a variable called <code>blockType</code>. If the block type at coordinates (10, 18, 13) is melon (block value 103), the <code>blockType</code> variable will hold a value of 103.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s put the <code>getBlock()</code> function to work. <a href="ch05.html#ch5ex2">Listing 5-2</a> checks whether the player is standing on dry land.</p>
<p class="sidenote"><span class="blue"><em>swimming.py</em></span></p>
<p class="programs"><span class="orange">from</span> mcpi.minecraft <span class="orange">import</span> Minecraft<br/>mc = Minecraft.create()<br/><br/>pos = mc.player.getPos()<br/>x = pos.x<br/>y = pos.y<br/>z = pos.z<br/><br/>blockType = mc.getBlock(x, y, z)<br/>mc.postToChat(blockType == 0)</p>
<p class="examplet"><a id="ch5ex2"/><em>Listing 5-2: This code checks the block type where the player’s legs are.</em></p>
<p class="indent">Here, I get the three coordinates of the player’s position and pass those coordinates as arguments to <code>getBlock()</code>. I store the result of <code>mc.getBlock(x, y, z)</code> in <code>blockType</code>. The expression <code>blockType == 0</code> checks whether the block is air; if it is air, you know you’re just standing somewhere in your Minecraft world, the expression is <code>True</code>, and <code>True</code> is posted to chat. If it’s not air, <code>False</code> is posted to chat, so you must be underwater or maybe drowning in sand!</p>
<p class="indent">Copy <a href="ch05.html#ch5ex2">Listing 5-2</a> and save it as <em>swimming.py</em> in the <em><a href="ch05.html#ch05">Chapter 5</a></em> directory. Then change the code so it checks whether the player is standing in water (block type 9) and run it.</p>
<p class="indent">Try standing in water and running the program. Make sure that when the player is in water, the chat displays <code>True</code>. When the player isn’t in water, the chat should display <code>False</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">The output of the program should look like <a href="ch05.html#ch5fig2">Figure 5-2</a>.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>At this point, you will not be able to run this program continuously. You must run the program every time you want to check the block below the player. This applies to all the other missions in this chapter as well.</em></p>

<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart"><strong>BONUS OBJECTIVE: I’M FLYING!</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">With a couple of changes to the code, you can check whether the block <em>below</em> you is air. This would tell you that you’re flying or jumping. How would you do this?</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch05lev2sec04"><strong><span class="blue">NOT EQUAL TO</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The not equal to comparator is the opposite of the equal to comparator. Instead of checking whether two values are the same, it checks whether they are different. When the two values are different, the comparison evaluates to <code>True</code>. When they are the same, it evaluates to <code>False</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">Say you want to make sure that an object is a rectangle but not a square. Because a non-square rectangle has a different length and width, you could write a comparison to check that the length and width are not equal:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> width = 3<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> length = 2<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> width != length<br/><span class="blue1">True</span></p>
<p class="indent">The <code>width != length</code> expression asks whether the values of <code>width</code> and <code>length</code> are different.</p>
<p class="indent">The result of this comparison is <code>True</code> because the <code>width</code> variable and the <code>length</code> variable have different values.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_87"/>But if these values are the same, the comparison returns <code>False</code>:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> width = 3<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> length = 3<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> width != length<br/><span class="blue1">False</span></p>
<p class="indent">The not equal to comparator also works with strings, integers, floats, and Booleans, just like the equal to comparator.</p>
<h4 class="h4a" id="ch05lev2sec05"><strong>MISSION #19: AM I STANDING IN SOMETHING OTHER THAN AIR?</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Let’s say you want to check whether you’re standing in something other than air, such as water, lava, dirt, gravel, or any other type of block. In <a href="ch05.html#ch05lev2sec03">Mission #18</a>, you checked whether the block at your current position was air, and you worked out how to check whether you were standing in water. You could copy and paste the program many times, changing it slightly each time to check for lava, dirt, gravel, and so on, one by one. But that would be very boring. Instead, use the not equal to comparator to check whether you’re underground, trapped in sand, at the bottom of the ocean, or even drowning in lava!</p>
<p class="indent">Open the program from <a href="ch05.html#ch05lev2sec03">Mission #18</a> (<em>swimming.py</em>) and save it as <em>notAir.py</em> in the <em>booleans</em> folder. Delete the last line of the program and replace it with <a href="ch05.html#ch5ex3">Listing 5-3</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">The last line of this code will print whether you’re not standing in air. The result of the comparison is stored in the <code>notAir</code> variable <span class="ent">➊</span>. When the comparison evaluates to <code>True</code>, the value of the <code>notAir</code> variable will be <code>True</code>, and when the comparison evaluates to <code>False</code>, the value of the <code>notAir</code> variable will be <code>False</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">But the comparison on the first line isn’t quite right <span class="ent">➊</span>. It currently checks whether the <code>blockType</code> is equal to air using the equal to comparator (<code>==</code>). Instead it should check whether the <code>blockType</code> variable is not equal to air using the not equal to comparator (<code>!=</code>). Change the first line to use the not equal to comparator instead of the equal to comparator. This will check whether the block at the player’s current position is not equal to air.</p>
<p class="indent">When you run the program, make sure it works when you’re standing in air and when you’re underwater, in lava, in gravel, in sand, or teleported into the ground.

<h4 class="h4" id="ch05lev2sec06"><strong><span class="blue">GREATER THAN AND LESS THAN</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">When you need to figure out whether one value is bigger than another, you use the greater than comparator. The greater than comparator will return <code>True</code> when the value on the left is greater than the value on the right. If the value on the left is less than or the same as the value on the right, the comparison will return <code>False</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">Say we have a minecart that can’t lift more than 99 blocks of obsidian. As long our minecart’s lifting limit is greater than the number of obsidian blocks it’s trying to lift, the blocks can be lifted:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> limit = 100<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> obsidian = 99<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> limit &gt; obsidian<br/><span class="blue1">True</span></p>
<p class="indent">Brilliant! Our minecart can carry any number of obsidian blocks that is less than 100, and 99 is less than 100, so <code>limit &gt; obsidian</code> evaluates to <code>True</code>. But what if someone adds another block of obsidian to the pile?</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> limit = 100<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> obsidian = 100<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> canLift = limit &gt; obsidian<br/><span class="blue1">False</span></p>
<p class="indent">Oh no, now the limit has been reached! The result is now <code>False</code>: 100 is not greater than 100; it’s the same. Our minecart can’t lift the obsidian.</p>
<p class="indent">The less than comparator works the same way.</p>

<p class="indent">In this case, the van will fit because it’s smaller than the bridge height: 8 is less than 12. Later in its journey, the same van might encounter another bridge that is too low to drive under:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> vanHeight = 8<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> bridgeHeight = 7<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> vanHeight &lt; bridgeHeight<br/><span class="blue1">False</span></p>
<p class="indent">Because 8 is not less than 7, the result is <code>False</code>.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch05lev2sec07"><strong><span class="blue">GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO AND LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Like the greater than comparator, the greater than or equal to comparator determines whether one value is greater than another. Unlike the greater than comparator, it will also evaluate to <code>True</code> if the values are the same.</p>

<p class="indent">I have enough stickers: 30 is the same as 30, so <code>stickers &gt;= people</code> evaluates to <code>True</code>. But say one of my friends thinks the stickers look cool and wants one. Now, 31 people want stickers:</p>

<p class="indent">I don’t have enough stickers: 30 is not greater than or equal to 31. It looks like my friend can’t have a sticker.</p>

<p class="noindent">Combining two or more comparators is often necessary in programs. You might want to determine whether two conditions are <code>True</code>: for example, you might want a car that is red <em>and</em> costs less than $10,000.</p>
<p class="indent">To combine two or more comparators, you use <em>logical operators</em>. Like comparators, you can use logical operators anywhere that you would use a Boolean value. Logical operators are also called <em>Boolean operators</em>. You’ll learn about three kinds of logical operators: <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code>.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch05lev2sec10"><a id="page_93"/><strong><span class="blue">AND</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Use the <code>and</code> operator when you want to check whether two comparisons are both <code>True</code>. For an expression with an <code>and</code> operator to be <code>True</code>, both comparisons must be <code>True</code>. If either comparison is <code>False</code>, the statement will return <code>False</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">Say I want to find out whether a person is older than 18 and owns a car. I might write the following program:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age = 21<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> ownsCar = <span class="orange">True</span><br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age &gt; 18<span class="ent">➊</span> <span class="orange">and</span> ownsCar == <span class="orange">True</span><span class="ent">➋</span><br/><span class="blue1">True</span></p>
<p class="indent">Here, we’re combining two comparators at <span class="ent">➊</span> and <span class="ent">➋</span> with <code>and</code>. Because the age of the person is greater than 18 (<code>age &gt; 18</code> evaluates to <code>True</code>) and they own a car (<code>ownsCar == True</code>), the entire expression <code>age &gt; 18 and ownsCar == True</code> evaluates to <code>True</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">If one of these comparisons was <code>False</code>, the statement would evaluate to <code>False</code>. Say the person doesn’t own a car but is older than 18:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age = 25<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> ownsCar = <span class="orange">False</span><br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age &gt; 18 <span class="orange">and</span> ownsCar == <span class="orange">True</span><br/><span class="blue1">False</span></p>
<p class="indent">Here, <code>age &gt; 18</code> evaluates to <code>True</code> and <code>ownsCar == True</code> evaluates to <code>False</code>, making the entire expression <code>False</code>.</p>

<h4 class="h4a" id="ch05lev2sec13"><strong>MISSION #23: AM I IN A TREE?</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The programs you’ve created so far in this chapter have displayed <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> depending on whether the player is standing on or in a particular block type. But what if you wanted to check whether the player is in a tree? How would you do this? Because trees are made of wood and leaves, you’d have to check whether the player is standing on wood <em>or</em> leaves.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s write a program. Open <em>swimming.py</em> again and save it as a new program called <em>inTree.py</em>.</p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_96"/>Change the program so it checks the type of block that is one block below the player. You’ll want to use the <code>or</code> operator to check whether the block below the player is leaves (block type 18) or wood (block type 11), then post the result to chat.</p>
<p class="indent">Recall that you can check the block below the player using <code>y = y - 1</code>.</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch05lev2sec14"><strong><span class="blue">NOT</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The <code>not</code> operator is quite a bit different from the <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> operators. It’s used on a single Boolean value or comparison and simply changes its value to the opposite.</p>
<p class="indent">In other words, <code>not</code> changes <code>True</code> to <code>False</code> and <code>False</code> to <code>True</code>:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="orange">not</span> <span class="orange">True</span><br/><span class="blue1">False</span><br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="orange">not</span> <span class="orange">False</span><br/><span class="blue1">True</span></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_97"/>The <code>not</code> operator is handy when you start combining it with other logical operators. Let’s assign the value of <code>timeForBed</code> if you’re <code>not hungry</code> and you are <code>sleepy</code>.</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> hungry = <span class="orange">False</span><br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> sleepy = <span class="orange">True</span><br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> timeForBed = <span class="orange">not</span> hungry <span class="orange">and</span> sleepy<br/><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="rose">print</span>(timeForBed)<br/><span class="blue1">True</span></p>
<p class="indent">The <code>not</code> operator only applies to the Boolean it is in front of. Here it reverses the value of the <code>hungry</code> variable and leaves the <code>sleepy</code> variable alone. Because we set <code>hungry</code> to <code>False</code> earlier, writing <code>not hungry</code> now changes the value to <code>True</code>. The value of <code>sleepy</code> is <code>True</code>. Both values are now <code>True</code>, so <code>timeForBed</code> is <code>True</code>.</p>

<p class="indent">In this mission, you’ll create a program that says whether or not you need to find food before you return to your Minecraft house. The program will check whether there is a melon at certain coordinates.

<p class="programs"><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="orange">True and not False or False</span><br/><span class="blue1">True</span></p>
<p class="indent"><a id="page_99"/>This code evaluates to <code>True</code>. Are you surprised? In this example, the <code>not False</code> part of the statement is evaluated first to <code>True</code>. This is equivalent to:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="orange">True and True or False</span><br/><span class="blue1">True</span></p>
<p class="indent">The <code>and</code> is then evaluated, and <code>True and True</code> evaluates to <code>True</code>, which is equivalent to:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="mer">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="orange">True or False</span><br/><span class="blue1">True</span></p>
<p class="indent">Finally, the <code>or</code> is evaluated, so <code>True or False</code> becomes <code>True</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">When Python evaluates logical operators, it uses a certain order. If you get the order wrong, you might get a result you weren’t expecting! Here’s what Python evaluates first, second, and third:</p>
<ol>
<li><p class="noindent"><code>not</code></p></li>
<li><p class="noindent"><code>and</code></p></li>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch05lev2sec17"><strong><span class="blue">IS MY NUMBER BETWEEN TWO OTHERS?</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Often, you’ll want to check whether a value is less than one value and greater than another. Let’s imagine you wanted to make sure that you had between 10 and 20 wolves, because you love wolves and want more than 10, but 20 or more might cause problems as you’d run out of food. You could test for this condition by using an <code>and</code> operator:</p>
<p class="programs">wolves = <span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Enter the number of wolves: "</span>)<br/>enoughWolves = wolves &gt; 10 <span class="orange">and</span> wolves &lt; 20<br/><span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Enough wolves: "</span> + <span class="rose">str</span>(enoughWolves))</p>
<p class="indent">But you could also do it another way. Instead of using the <code>and</code> operator, write the variable once in the middle of two comparisons:</p>
<p class="programs">wolves = <span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Enter the number of wolves: "</span>)<br/>enoughWolves = 10 &lt; wolves &lt; 20<br/><span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Enough wolves: "</span> + <span class="rose">str</span>(enoughWolves))</p>
<p class="indent">If you run either of these programs and enter a number between 10 and 20 but not equal to either, then <code>enoughWolves</code> will be <code>True</code>. You can do the <a id="page_100"/>same using the greater than or equal to operators (<code>&gt;=</code>) and the less than or equal to operators (<code>&lt;=</code>):</p>
<p class="programs">wolves = <span class="rose">input</span>(<span class="green">"Enter the number of wolves: "</span>)<br/>enoughWolves = 10 &lt;= wolves &lt;= 20<br/><span class="rose">print</span>(<span class="green">"Enough wolves: "</span> + <span class="rose">str</span>(enoughWolves))</p>
<p class="indent">In this case, entering 10 or 20 would also give <code>enoughWolves</code> a value of <code>True</code>.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec05"><strong><span class="blue">WHAT YOU LEARNED</span></strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you used Booleans, comparators, and logical operators to answer questions in your programs. In <a href="ch06.html#ch06">Chapter 6</a>, you’ll write programs that make decisions based on the answers to these questions. You’ll check whether a condition is true or not, and you’ll tell the program to run some code if the condition is true or run different code if it’s false. In <a href="ch07.html#ch07">Chapter 7</a>, your programs will keep running a piece of code as long as a condition is true and stop if the condition becomes false. This is the real power of Booleans and comparators. They help you control which code gets run in your program and exactly when the code gets run.<a id="page_102"/></p>

			<p class="ChapterIntro">In this chapter, you’ll start learning how to think like a hacker to find weaknesses in security measures. You’ll discover a simple hack for revealing passwords hidden in a web browser. This hack works because web browsers protect passwords using <em>security through obscurity</em>.</p>
			<p>
				Security through obscurity is a technique that attempts to keep something safe by hiding it. In the physical world, hiding your house key under the welcome mat on your front porch is an example of security through obscurity. Your house may <em>feel</em> secure, but that security breaks down as soon as someone thinks to look under the mat.</p>
			<p>
				Hiding something to keep it safe isn’t necessarily a bad approach, unless it’s the <em>only</em> security measure you’ve taken. Unfortunately, security through obscurity often fails, especially when it’s applied to our computers. For example, many users “hide” their passwords in a text document or Excel spreadsheet on their computer or, worse, on a sticky note under their keyboard or in a desk drawer. These passwords are even easier to find than <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_2" title="2"/>the one you’ll hack in this chapter. Similarly, some software developers hardcode obscured passwords and other secret values into their applications, but a skilled hacker can often find and decode those values.</p>
			<p>As you’ll see in this chapter, if obscurity is your only security, all that stands between you and a motivated intruder is a little of their time and energy spent searching for the way in.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502000c01-0001">How Browsers “Secure” Passwords</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">When you enter your password to log in to an online service, such as an email or a social media account, your web browser usually hides the password with dots or asterisks. That way, someone looking over your shoulder can’t read it. If you tell your browser to save your password and you come back to the site later, those dots or asterisks will appear in the password field automatically when the browser fills in your stored password for you.</p>
			<p>These dots or asterisks are a great example of security through obscurity. Your browser isn’t encrypting your password or protecting it in any other special way. It’s just obscuring the characters in the password field to protect your password from casual snoopers. This technique isn’t actually secure at all. In fact, a hacker needs just a few seconds on your keyboard to view the password.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502000c01-0002">Revealing an Obscured Password</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">To reveal a password obscured by your browser, we’ll use the browser’s Inspect tool. This tool lets you view and temporarily edit a web page’s <em>source code</em>, the code that tells your browser how to display the web page. We’ll change the piece of the source code that makes the password show up as dots or asterisks. When we’re done, the password will display as regular text instead.</p>
			<p>This isn’t the sort of hack that could take down a nation-state or compromise millions of people’s private data in one fell swoop. Rather, this hack illustrates one of the guiding principles of hacking: using an existing tool—in this case, a browser’s Inspect tool—in a creative way to accomplish a particular goal—revealing a hidden password. At the same time, this hack demonstrates the risk of storing passwords in a browser in the event an attacker gets physical access to your computer.</p>
			<p>Let’s try out the hack, using the Twitter login page as an example. We’ll enter a fake username and password, launch the browser’s Inspect tool, and update the source code to expose the password.</p>
			<ol class="decimal">
				<li value="1">Open Google Chrome and go to <a class="LinkURL" href="https://twitter.com/login/">https://twitter.com/login/</a>. This hack will also work in other browsers, but we’ll use Chrome for simplicity.</li>
				<li value="2">Enter your name in the username field and type <code class="bold">Notmyrealpassword!</code> into the password field. <em>Don’t</em> enter your real password. The password will be obscured by dots, as shown in <a href="#figure1-1" id="figureanchor1-1">Figure 1-1</a>.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_3" title="3"/>

						</figcaption>
					</figure>
					</li>
				<li value="3">Right-click (or <span class="KeyCaps">CONTROL</span>-click on a Mac) the password field and select <b>Inspect</b>, as shown in <a href="#figure1-2" id="figureanchor1-2">Figure 1-2</a>. The Inspect tool, which will look like an assortment of windows showing code, should open in your browser. Since you right-clicked the password field to open the Inspect tool, the browser should already be highlighting the part of the code that creates the password field in the login page.

This piece of code is how the browser identifies the password field. The browser knows that any text in a field with type <code>password</code> should be obscured.

				<li value="5">With <code>password</code> highlighted, press the spacebar to replace <code>password</code> with a space (<code>type=" "</code>), as shown in <a href="#figure1-4" id="figureanchor1-4">Figure 1-4</a>. We’ve now changed (or hacked) the code for the password field so that the browser no longer knows it’s supposed to be a password-type field. This should reveal any text in the password field!

			</ol>
			<p>
				This hack worked because the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> tag that lets web developers create password fields is insecure—and it has been for a quarter of a century. In the 1990s, when early web developers added the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> tag to <em>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</em>, the language that makes web pages display in web browsers, their only security feature was replacing password characters with dots or asterisks by using the extra code <code>type="password"</code>. However, since regular text boxes also use the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> tag, we can use the Inspect tool to change a password input into a regular text input just by changing <code>type="password"</code> to <code>type=" "</code>.</p>

			<h2 id="h1-502000c01-0003">Using and Misusing This Hack</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">The hack we just carried out has practical, ethical applications. Because passwords stored in a browser are autofilled but obscured on a website’s login screen, you can use this simple hack to unmask a password you’ve forgotten. This is especially useful if you store your passwords on one machine, like your home computer, but periodically have to log in from other machines, like your work computer, a family member’s computer, or your mobile device. If you can’t remember your password when you try to log in on another computer, you can unmask the stored password on your home computer to look it up rather than reset your password.</p>
			<p>This hack can be used ethically in other ways as well. For example, if an employee leaves a company unexpectedly, an ethical hacker with the permission of the company’s owner can use this hack to recover passwords to important online accounts the employee might have been responsible for.</p>
			<p>
				If you practice it enough times, you can easily perform this hack in under 5 seconds. However, that also means that if you ever store a password in a public computer, anyone with physical access to that computer needs only 5 seconds to steal it. A black hat hacker can walk into a hotel lobby or public library almost anywhere in the world, sit down at a computer, check <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_7" title="7"/>the browser’s history for recently visited websites, and see if any potential victims saved their passwords when logging in to their private accounts.</p>
			<p>
				You don’t even have to save your password in the browser for someone to reveal it. If you’re in a public place and someone distracts you from your computer while you’re entering your password into a website, they can use this hack to steal your password. They can even repair the <code>type="password"</code> code and close the Inspect tool to cover their tracks! If you’ve used that same password for multiple accounts, the attacker will now be able to access all those other accounts too.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502000c01-0004">Protecting Your Passwords</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">The hack we’ve discussed, when used maliciously, poses a clear risk to the security of your passwords. However, there are some simple ways you can protect yourself. For one, this hack is possible only if the hacker has physical access to the stored passwords, so the key to preventing an attack is either not storing passwords in your browser at all or limiting the following:</p>
			<ol class="none">
				<li><span class="RunInHead">Where you store passwords</span>  Store a password in a browser only on a computer or device you own and keep with you, never on a public computer.</li>
				<li><span class="RunInHead">Which passwords you store</span>  Never store your email password, because an attacker can usually discover or reset all your other passwords with your email account.</li>
				<li><span class="RunInHead">Who has access to your computer</span>  Keep your computer with you or stored in a safe place, and don’t leave it open if you have to step away, even for a minute.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				If you must connect to a private account from a public computer, limit the information stored in the browser by using Incognito mode (<span class="KeyCaps">CTRL</span><span class="SmallCaps">-</span><span class="KeyCaps">SHIFT</span>-N) in Chrome or opening a new Private Window in Firefox (<span class="KeyCaps">CTRL</span>-<span class="KeyCaps">SHIFT</span>-P) or Safari (<span class="KeyCaps">SHIFT</span>-<span class="KeyCaps">⌘</span>-N). <em>Remember to both log out and close the browser completely when you finish your session.</em> Even if you log out or use Incognito mode, shared computers are risky, because malware can record your keystrokes or other information. (In fact, we’ll capture keystrokes using a virus we create in Chapter 6.) Only log in to accounts from a public computer if it’s absolutely necessary. Also, think about changing your passwords when you get back to your own computer.</p>
			<p>
				If you’re using your personal computer in a public place, be sure to log out or lock the screen if you walk away—or better yet, keep your computer with you. Set your lock screen or screensaver to turn on after only a few minutes to limit the amount of time your computer is vulnerable, in case you forget to lock it yourself. Use a strong password or passphrase (try four or more words) for logging in to your computer, rather than something obvious like <em>password123</em>, so others can’t easily unlock your computer if it’s left unattended.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_8" title="8"/>Beyond these measures, you should take advantage of other password security tools, such as two-factor authentication and a password manager like KeePass, Dashlane, LastPass, or similar. We’ll discuss these tools in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 11">Chapter 11</span>.</p>
			<p>Protecting yourself from computer attacks takes a few smart precautions, but it’s important to know how to balance convenience and security. Storing all your passwords for everything in your browser seems convenient because you never have to type them in, but it also means everyone with access to that computer can steal your passwords and your accounts. We have to find the right balance between convenience and security, both in the physical world and online.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502000c01-0005">The Takeaway</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">In this chapter, you saw that security through obscurity is easily defeated and thus not very secure at all. You learned how to reveal a password entered into a browser in seconds, using only a few steps. You also learned the importance of never storing a password on a public or shared computer. In addition, you know now to physically protect your computer from people you don’t know or trust—if someone can touch your keyboard, they can access your sensitive information.</p>
			<p>The hack discussed in this chapter was an example of a physical access hack—the attacker needs physical access to your computer to execute it. In the next chapter, you’ll find out about other physical access hacks that allow hackers to obtain files from your hard drive, without needing to know your login information.</p>

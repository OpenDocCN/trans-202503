    A64 ISA, the latest ARM ISA that is in use on all Linux OS ARM computers. Recall
    that an instruction set architecture (or ISA; see [Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml#ch05))
    defines the set of instructions and binary encodings of a machine-level program.
    To run the examples in this chapter, you will need access to a machine with an
    ARMv8-A processor with a 64-bit operating system installed. The examples in this
    chapter use a Raspberry Pi 3B+ running the 64-bit Ubuntu Mate operating system.
    Note that every Raspberry Pi released since 2016 can use the A64 ISA. However,
    Raspberry Pi OS (the default Raspberry Pi operating system) is still 32-bit as
    of this writing.

- en: The ARMv8-A ISA also specifies special-purpose registers. The first two worth

    the program stack. The `pc` register points to the next instruction to be executed
    by the CPU; unlike the other registers, programs cannot write directly to the
    `pc` register. Next, the *zero register* `zr` permanently stores the value 0,

    64-bit registers when dealing with 64-bit values (e.g., pointers or `long` types)
    and the 32-bit component registers when dealing with 32-bit types (e.g., `int`).
    In A64, it is very common to see 32-bit component registers intermixed with the
    full 64-bit registers. For example, in the `adder2` function shown earlier, the
    compiler references component register `w0` instead of `x0` given that `int` types
    typically take up 32 bits (four bytes) of space on 64-bit systems. If the `adder2`
    function had a `long` parameter instead of an `int` parameter, the compiler would
    store `a` in register `x0` instead of component register `w0`.

  zh: 在阅读汇编代码时，请记住编译器通常在处理64位值（例如指针或`long`类型）时使用64位寄存器，并在处理32位类型（例如`int`）时使用32位组件寄存器。在A64中，经常看到32位组件寄存器与完整的64位寄存器混用。例如，在前述的`adder2`函数中，编译器使用组件寄存器`w0`而不是`x0`，因为`int`类型在64位系统上通常占用32位（四字节）空间。如果`adder2`函数有一个`long`参数而不是`int`参数，编译器将会将`a`存储在寄存器`x0`而不是组件寄存器`w0`中。
- en: For readers previously familiar with the A32 ISA, it is important to note that
    the 32-bit general-purpose registers `r0` to `r12` from the A32 ISA map to the

    register `w3`. The operand `[x0]` indicates that the value inside `x0` should
    be treated as an address, and to dereference (look up) the value at that address.
    Therefore, the operand `[x0]` corresponds to *(0x804) or the value 0xCA. An operation
    on a 32-bit register can be combined with a 64-bit register using the sign-extend
    word (`SXTW`) instruction. So, `[x0, w3, SXTW]` sign extends `w3` into a 64-bit
    value before adding it to `x0` and performing a memory lookup. Lastly, scaled
    memory types enable the calculation of offsets through the use of a left shift.

    assist with maintaining the organization of the program stack (i.e., the *call
    stack*). Recall that the *stack pointer* (`sp`) is reserved by the compiler for
    call stack management. Recall also from our earlier discussion on program memory
    in “Parts of Program Memory and Scope” on [page 64](ch02.xhtml#lev1_9) that the
    call stack typically stores local variables and parameters and helps the program
    track its own execution (see [Figure 9-2](ch09.xhtml#ch9fig2)). On ARM systems,
    the execution stack grows toward *lower* addresses. Like all stack data structures,
    operations occur at the “top” of the call stack; `sp` therefore “points” to the
    top of the stack, and its value is the address of top of the stack.

    held in register `x0` and at an offset of eight from that memory location (i.e.,
    `x0`+0x8) into the destination registers D1 and D2, respectively. Meanwhile, the
    `stp` instruction stores the pair of values in source registers S1 and S2 to the
    memory locations held in register `x0` and at an offset of eight from that address
    (i.e., `x0`+0x8). Note that the assumption here is that the values in the registers
    are 64-bit quantities. If 32-bit registers are being used instead, the memory
    offsets change to `x0` and `x0`+0x4, respectively.

    指令将源寄存器 S1 和 S2 中的一对值存储到寄存器 `x0` 所持有的内存位置及该地址偏移8字节（即 `x0`+0x8）处。请注意，这里假设寄存器中的值是64位数。如果使用的是32位寄存器，则内存偏移会变为
    `x0` 和 `x0`+0x4。
- en: 'There are also two special forms of the `ldp` and `stp` instructions that enable
    simultaneous updates to `x0`. For example, the instruction `stp S1, S2, [x0,`
    `#-16]!` implies that 16 bytes should *first* be subtracted from `x0`, and only
    afterward should S1 and S2 be stored at the offsets `[x0]` and `[x0+8]`. In contrast,
    the instruction `ldp D1, D2, [x0], #0x10` states that the values at offsets `[x0]`
    and `[x0+8]` should first be stored in destination registers D1 and D2, and *only
    afterward* should `x0` have 16 bytes added to it. These special forms are commonly

    of program memory (see “Parts of Program Memory and Scope” on [page 64](ch02.xhtml#lev1_9)).
    Recall that every time a program executes, the operating system allocates the
    new program’s address space (also known as *virtual memory*). Virtual memory and
    the related concept of processes are covered in greater detail in [Chapter 13](ch13.xhtml#ch13);
    for now, it suffices to think of a process as the abstraction of a running program
    and virtual memory as the memory that is allocated to a single process. Every
    process has its own region of memory called the *call stack*. Keep in mind that
    the call stack is located in process/virtual memory, unlike registers (which are
    located in the CPU).

  zh: 汇编代码由一个 `sub` 指令、接着是 `str` 和 `ldr` 指令、两个 `add` 指令，最后是一个 `ret` 指令组成。为了理解 CPU
    如何执行这一组指令，我们需要回顾程序内存的结构（参见 [第64页](ch02.xhtml#lev1_9)中的“程序内存和作用域”）。回想一下，每当程序执行时，操作系统会为新程序分配地址空间（也叫做
    *虚拟内存*）。虚拟内存和相关的进程概念在 [第13章](ch13.xhtml#ch13)中有更详细的讨论；现在，理解一个进程就是运行中的程序的抽象，虚拟内存就是为单个进程分配的内存就足够了。每个进程都有自己的一块内存区域，称为
    *调用栈*。请记住，调用栈位于进程/虚拟内存中，而寄存器则位于 CPU 中。

    Multiplication and division instructions typically take a long time to execute.
    Bit shifting offers the compiler a shortcut for multiplicands and divisors that
    are powers of 2\. For example, to compute `77 * 4`, most compilers will translate
    this operation to `77 ≪ 2` to avoid the use of a `mul` instruction. Likewise,
    to compute `77 / 4`, a compiler typically translates this operation to `77 ≫ 2`
    to avoid using the `sdiv` instruction.

    one is usually a register (denoted by R) and the other is a 6-bit shift value
    (v). On 64-bit systems, the shift value is encoded as a single byte (since it
    doesn’t make sense to shift past 63). The shift value v must either be a constant
    or stored in a component register.

    and digits followed by a colon. Labels can be *local* or *global* to an object
    file’s scope. Function labels tend to be *global* and usually consist of the function
    name and a colon. For example, `main:` (or `<main>:`) is used to label a user-defined
    `main` function. In contrast, labels whose scope are *local* are preceded by a

    When the CPU executes a `b` instruction, it sets the `pc` register to `addr`.
    The `b` instruction enables the program counter to change within 128 MB of its
    current location; a programmer writing assembly can also specify a particular

    Therefore, an instruction whose address is 28 bytes away from the start of `main`
    may be represented with the label `<main+28>`. For example, the instruction `b`
    `0x7d0 <main+28>` indicates a branch to address 0x7d0, which has the associated
    label `<main+28>`, meaning that it is 28 bytes away from the starting address
    of the `main` function. Executing this instruction sets `pc` to 0x7d0.

    are discouraged from using them to avoid writing code that is difficult to read,

    as GCC typically changes C code with conditionals into a `goto` form prior to

    Note that this assembly segment has been lightly edited for the sake of simplicity.
    By convention, GCC places the first and second parameters of a function in registers
    `x0` and `x1`, respectively. Since the parameters to `getSmallest` are of type
    `int`, the compiler places the parameters in the respective component registers

- en: Let’s begin with a refresher on how the call stack is managed. Recall that `sp`
    is the *stack pointer* and always points to the top of the stack. The register
    `x29` represents the base pointer (also known as the *frame pointer* or `FP`)
    and points to the base of the current stack frame. The *stack frame* (also known
    as the *activation frame* or the *activation record*) refers to the portion of
    the stack allocated to a single function call. The currently executing function
    is always at the top of the stack, and its stack frame is referred to as the *active
    frame*. The active frame is bounded by the stack pointer (at the top of stack,
    lower address) and frame pointer (at the bottom of the frame, higher address).
    The activation record typically holds local variables for a function. Lastly,
    the *return address* indicates the program address at which the calling function
    (e.g., `main`) resumes execution as soon as the callee function exits. In A64
    systems, the return address is stored in register `x30` (also known as `LR`).

- en: In [Figure 9-4](ch09.xhtml#ch9fig4), the current active frame belongs to the
    callee function (`fname`). The region of the call stack between the stack and
    frame pointers is used for local variables. The stack pointer moves as local values
    are pushed onto and popped from the stack. The frame pointer is not commonly used
    in optimized code, and is usually optional for operation. As a result, compilers
    like GCC commonly reference values on the stack relative to the stack pointer.
    In [Figure 9-4](ch09.xhtml#ch9fig4), the active frame is bounded below by the
    base pointer of `fname`, or `x29`, which contains stack address 0xef30\. The value
    stored at address 0xef30 is the “saved” frame pointer value (0xef50), which itself
    indicates the bottom of the activation frame for the `main` function. Right below
    the frame pointer is a saved *return address* (stored in `x30`), which indicates
    the address that the program will continue executing once `main` exits.

    its code region (code memory). Whereas `sp` and `x29` point to addresses in the
    stack memory, `pc` points to an address in *code* memory. In other words, the
    return address is an address in *code* memory, not stack memory (see [Figure 9-5](ch09.xhtml#ch9fig5)).

- en: The `bl` and `ret` instructions play a prominent role in the process where one
    function calls another. Both instructions modify the instruction pointer (register
    `pc`). When the caller function executes the `bl` instruction, the value of `pc`
    + 4 is saved in register `x30` to represent the return address, or the program
    address at which the caller resumes executing once the callee function finishes.
    The `bl` instruction also replaces the value of `pc` with the address of the callee
    function.

    stored in memory. Statically allocated single-dimension arrays (see “Single-Dimensional
    Arrays” on [page 81](ch02.xhtml#lev2_22)) have the form <type> `arr[N]`, where
    <type> is the data type, `arr` is the identifier associated with the array, and
    `N` is the number of data elements. Declaring an array statically as <type> `arr[N]`
    or dynamically as `arr = malloc(N*sizeof(` <type>`))` allocates *N* × `sizeof(`
    <type>`)` total bytes of memory.

    Compilers commonly convert array references into pointer arithmetic (see “Pointer
    Variables” on [page 67](ch02.xhtml#lev1_10)) prior to translating to assembly.
    So, `arr+i` is equivalent to `&arr[i]`, and `*(arr+i)` is equivalent to `arr[i]`.
    Since each data element in `arr` is of type <type>, `arr+i` implies that element

    To understand why this is necessary, recall that any element at index `i` in an

    therefore multiply the index by the size of the data type (in this case 4, given

    through `<sumMatrix+80>` add `total` to `matrix[i][j]` and update the variable

    the address of `M2` (*a*[0]), yielding the new address *a*[8]. A dereference of
    this address yields the address associated with `M2[1]`, or *a*[36]. The compiler
    then multiplies index 2 by 4 (`sizeof(int)`), and adds the result (8) to *a*[36],
    yielding a final address of *a*[44]. The address *a*[44] is dereferenced, yielding
    the value 5\. Sure enough, the element in [Figure 9-12](ch09.xhtml#ch9fig12) that

    MIT (to hide that it was written by a student at Cornell) and exploited a buffer
    overrun vulnerability that existed in the Unix finger daemon (`fingerd`). In Linux
    and other Unix-like systems, a *daemon* is a type of process that continuously
    executes in the background, usually performing clean-up and monitoring tasks.
    The `fingerd` daemon returns a user-friendly report on a computer or person. Most
    crucially, the worm had a replication mechanism that caused it to be sent to the
    same computer multiple times, bogging down the system to an unusable state. Even
    though the author claimed that the worm was meant as a harmless intellectual exercise,
    the replication mechanism enabled the worm to spread easily and made it difficult
    to remove. In future years, other worms would employ buffer overflow exploits
    to gain unauthorized access into systems. Notable examples include Code Red (2001),
    MS-SQLSlammer (2003), and W32/Blaster (2003).

    AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) was *the* service to use if you wanted to instant
    message (or IM) friends and family. Microsoft tried to gain a foothold in this
    market by designing a feature in MMS that enabled MMS users to talk to their AIM
    “buddies.” Displeased, AOL patched their servers so that MMS could no longer connect
    to them. Microsoft engineers figured out a way for MMS clients to mimic the messages
    sent by AIM clients to AOL servers, making it difficult for AOL to distinguish
    between messages received by MMS and AIM. AOL responded by changing the way AIM
    sent messages, and MMS engineers duly changed their client’s messages to once
    again match AIM’s. This “chat war” continued until AOL started using a buffer
    overflow error *in their own client* to verify that sent messages came from AIM
    clients. Since MMS clients did not have the same vulnerability, the chat wars
    ended, with AOL as the victor.

    forcing it to return a zero value associated with success. We had to accomplish
    this in a fairly wonky way due to stack protections that ARM and GCC include to
    combat this particular type of attack. However, buffer overflow exploits can do
    real damage on older systems. Some older computer systems also *executed* bytes
    from stack memory. If an attacker placed bytes associated with assembly instructions
    on the call stack, the CPU would interpret the bytes as *real* instructions, enabling
    the attacker to force the CPU to execute *any arbitrary code of their choosing*.
    Fortunately, there are strategies that modern computer systems employ to make
    it more difficult for attackers to run buffer overflow exploits:'

- en: '**Stack randomization.**   The OS allocates the starting address of the stack
    at a random location in stack memory, causing the position/size of the call stack
    to vary from one run of a program to another. When we overwrote the `/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space`
    file with a 0 value, we temporarily turned off stack randomization on the Raspberry
    Pi (this file returns to its original value on restart). Without turning off stack
    randomization, multiple machines running the same code would have different stack
    addresses. Modern Linux systems use stack randomization as a standard practice.
    However, a determined attacker can brute force the attack, by attempting to repeat
    attacks with different addresses. A common trick is to use a *NOP sled* (i.e.,
    a large number of NOP instructions) before the actual exploit code. Executing
    the NOP instruction (`0x90`) has no effect, other than causing the program counter
    to increment to the next instruction. As long as the attacker can get the CPU
    to execute somewhere in the NOP sled, the NOP sled will eventually lead to the
    exploit code that follows it. Aleph One’s writeup^([12](ch09.xhtml#fn9_12)) details
    the mechanism of this type of attack.'

    when the stack is corrupted. Recent versions of GCC use a stack protector known
    as a *canary* that acts as a guard between the buffer and the other elements of
    the stack. A canary is a value stored in a nonwriteable section of memory that
    can be compared to a value put on the stack. If the canary “dies” during a program’s
    execution, the program knows that it is under attack and aborts with an error
    message. For simplicity, we removed the canary from our `secret` executable by
    compiling it with the `fno-stack-protector` flag in GCC. However, a clever attacker
    can replace the canary during the course of the attack to prevent the program
    from detecting stack corruption.'

    in executable regions and jump from instruction to instruction to build an exploit.

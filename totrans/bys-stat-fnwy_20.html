<div class="image1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/common.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In the previous chapter, we saw that we can view a hypothesis test as an extension of parameter estimation. In this chapter, we’ll think about hypothesis tests instead as a way to compare ideas with an important mathematical tool called the <em>Bayes factor</em>. The Bayes factor is a formula that tests the plausibility of one hypothesis by comparing it to another. The result tells us how many times more likely one hypothesis is than the other.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We’ll then see how to combine the Bayes factor with our prior beliefs to come up with the posterior odds, which tells us how much stronger one belief is than the other at explaining our data.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch16lev1sec1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_158"/><strong>Revisiting Bayes’ Theorem</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06">Chapter 6</a> introduced Bayes’ theorem, which takes the following form:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0158-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Recall that there are three parts of this formula that have special names:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li class="noindent"><em>P</em>(<em>H</em> | <em>D</em>) is the <em>posterior probability</em>, which tells us how strongly we should believe in our hypothesis, given our data.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent"><em>P</em>(<em>H</em>) is the <em>prior belief</em>, or the probability of our hypothesis prior to looking at the data.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent"><em>P</em>(<em>D</em> | <em>H</em>) is the <em>likelihood</em> of getting the existing data if our hypothesis were true.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="indent">The last piece, <em>P</em>(<em>D</em>), is the probability of the data observed independent of the hypothesis. We need <em>P</em>(<em>D</em>) in order to make sure that our posterior probability is correctly placed somewhere between 0 and 1. If we have all of these pieces of information, we can calculate exactly how strongly we should believe in our hypothesis given the data we’ve observed. But as I mentioned in <a href="ch08.xhtml#ch08">Chapter 8</a>, <em>P</em>(<em>D</em>) is often very hard to define. In many cases, it’s not obvious how we can figure out the probability of our data. <em>P</em>(<em>D</em>) is also totally unnecessary if all we care about is comparing the relative strength of two different hypotheses.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For these reasons, we often use the <em>proportional form</em> of Bayes’ theorem, which allows us to analyze the strength of our hypotheses without knowing <em>P</em>(<em>D</em>). It looks like this:</p>&#13;
<p class="equ"><em>P</em>(<em>H</em> | <em>D</em>) ∝ <em>P</em>(<em>H</em>) × <em>P</em>(<em>D</em> | <em>H</em>)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In plain English, the proportional form of Bayes’ theorem says that the posterior probability of our hypothesis is proportional to the prior multiplied by the likelihood. We can use this to compare two hypotheses by examining the ratio of the prior belief multiplied by the likelihood for each hypothesis using the <em>ratio of posteriors</em> formula:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0158-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">What we have now is a ratio of how well each of our hypotheses explains the data we’ve observed. That is, if the ratio is 2, then <em>H</em><sub>1</sub> explains the observed data twice as well as <em>H</em><sub>2</sub>, and if the ratio is 1/2, then <em>H</em><sub>2</sub> explains the data twice as well as <em>H</em><sub>1</sub>.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch16lev1sec2"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_159"/><strong>Building a Hypothesis Test Using the Ratio of Posteriors</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The ratio of posteriors formula gives us the <em>posterior odds</em>, which allows us to test hypotheses or beliefs we have about data. Even when we do know <em>P</em>(<em>D</em>), the posterior odds is a useful tool because it allows us to compare ideas. To better understand the posterior odds, we’ll break down the ratio of posteriors formula into two parts: the likelihood ratio, or the Bayes factor, and the ratio of prior probabilities. This is a standard, and very helpful, practice that makes it much easier to reason about the likelihood and the prior probability separately.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch16lev2sec1"><strong><em>The Bayes Factor</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Using the ratio of posteriors formula, let’s assume that <em>P</em>(<em>H</em><sub>1</sub>) = <em>P</em>(<em>H</em><sub>2</sub>)—that is, that our prior belief in each hypothesis is the same. In that case, the ratio of prior beliefs in the hypotheses is just 1, so all that’s left is:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0159-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">This is the Bayes factor, the ratio between the likelihoods of two hypotheses.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Take a moment to really think about what this equation is saying. When we consider how we’re going to argue for our <em>H</em><sub>1</sub>—that is, our belief about the world—we think about gathering evidence that supports our beliefs. A typical argument, therefore, involves building up a set of data, <em>D</em><sub>1</sub>, that supports <em>H</em><sub>1</sub>, and then arguing with a friend who has gathered a set of data, <em>D</em><sub>2</sub>, that supports their hypothesis, <em>H</em><sub>2</sub>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In Bayesian reasoning, though, we’re not gathering evidence to support our ideas; we’re looking to see how well our ideas explain the evidence in front of us. What this ratio tells us is the likelihood of what we’ve seen given what <em>we</em> believe to be true compared to what <em>someone else</em> believes to be true. Our hypothesis wins when it explains the world better than the competing hypothesis.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If, however, the competing hypothesis explains the data much better than ours, it might be time to change our beliefs. The key here is that in Bayesian reasoning, we don’t worry about supporting our beliefs—we are focused on how well our beliefs support the data we observe. In the end, data can either confirm our ideas or lead us to change our minds.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch16lev2sec2"><strong><em>Prior Odds</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">So far we have assumed that the prior probability of each hypothesis is the same. This is clearly not always the case: a hypothesis may explain the data well even if it is very unlikely. If you’ve lost your phone, for example, both the belief that you left it in the bathroom and the belief that aliens took it to examine human technology explain the data quite well. However, the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_160"/>bathroom hypothesis is clearly much more likely. This is why we need to consider the ratio of prior probabilities:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0160-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">This ratio compares the probability of two hypotheses before we look at the data. When used in relation to the Bayes factor, this ratio is called the <em>prior odds</em> in our <em>H</em><sub>1</sub> and written as <em>O</em>(<em>H</em><sub>1</sub>). This representation is helpful because it lets us easily note how strongly (or weakly) we believe in the hypothesis we’re testing. When this number is greater than 1, it means the prior odds favor our hypothesis, and when it is a fraction less than 1, it means they’re against our hypothesis. For example, <em>O</em>(<em>H</em><sub>1</sub>) = 100 means that, without any other information, we believe <em>H</em><sub>1</sub> is 100 times more likely than the alternative hypothesis. On the other hand, when <em>O</em>(<em>H</em><sub>1</sub>) = 1/100, the alternative hypothesis is 100 times more likely than ours.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch16lev2sec3"><strong><em>Posterior Odds</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">If we put together the Bayes factor and the prior odds, we get the posterior odds:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0160-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">The posterior odds calculates how many times better our hypothesis explains the data than a competing hypothesis.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="ch16.xhtml#ch16tab01">Table 16-1</a> lists some guidelines for evaluating various posterior odds values.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">We can look at the reciprocal of these odds to decide when to change our mind about an idea.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">While these values can serve as a useful guide, Bayesian reasoning is still a form of reasoning, which means you have to use some judgment. If you’re having a casual disagreement with a friend, a posterior odds of 2 might be enough to make you feel confident. If you’re trying to figure out if you’re drinking poison, a posterior odds of 100 still might not cut it.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_161"/>Next, we’ll look at two examples in which we use the Bayes factor to determine the strength of our beliefs.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch16lev3sec1"><strong>Testing for a Loaded Die</strong></h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">We can use the Bayes factor and posterior odds as a form of hypothesis testing in which each test is a competition between two ideas. Suppose your friend has a bag with three six-sided dice in it, and one die is weighted so that it lands on 6 half the time. The other two are traditional dice whose probability of rolling a 6 is <span class="ent">⅙</span>. Your friend pulls out a die and rolls 10 times, with the following results:</p>&#13;
<p class="equ">6, 1, 3, 6, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 6</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We want to figure out if this is the loaded die or a regular die. We can call the loaded die <em>H</em><sub>1</sub> and the regular die <em>H</em><sub>2</sub>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s start by working out the Bayes factor:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0161-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">The first step is calculating <em>P</em>(<em>D</em> | <em>H</em>), or the likelihood of <em>H</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>H</em><sub>2</sub> given the data we’ve observed. In this example, your friend rolled four 6s and six non-6s. We know that if the die is loaded, the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/2 and the probability of rolling any non-6 is also 1/2. This means the likelihood of seeing this data given that we’ve used the loaded die is:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0161-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the case of the fair die, the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/6, while the probability of rolling anything else is 5/6. This means our likelihood of seeing this data for <em>H</em><sub>2</sub>, the hypothesis that the die is fair, is:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0161-03.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now we can compute our Bayes factor, which will tell us how much better <em>H</em><sub>1</sub> is than <em>H</em><sub>2</sub> at explaining our data, assuming each hypothesis was equally probable in the first place (meaning that the prior odds ratio is 1):</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0161-04.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">This means that <em>H</em><sub>1</sub>, the belief that the die is loaded, explains the data we observed almost four times better than <em>H</em><sub>2</sub>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_162"/>However, this is true only if <em>H</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>H</em><sub>2</sub> are both just as likely to be true in the first place. But we know there are two fair dice in the bag and only one loaded die, which means that each hypothesis was <em>not</em> equally likely. Based on the distribution of the dice in the bag, we know that these are the prior probabilities for each hypothesis:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0162-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">From these, we can calculate the prior odds for <em>H</em><sub>1</sub>:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0162-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Because there is only one loaded die in the bag and two fair dice, we’re twice as likely to pull a fair die than a loaded one. With our prior odds for <em>H</em><sub>1</sub>, we can now compute our full posterior odds:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0162-03.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">While the initial likelihood ratio showed that <em>H</em><sub>1</sub> explained the data almost four times as well as <em>H</em><sub>2</sub>, the posterior odds shows us that, because <em>H</em><sub>1</sub> is only half as likely as <em>H</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>H</em><sub>1</sub> is actually only about twice as strong of an explanation as <em>H</em><sub>2</sub>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">From this, if you absolutely had to draw a conclusion about whether the die was loaded or not, your best bet would be to say that it is indeed loaded. However, a posterior odds of less than 2 is not particularly strong evidence in favor of <em>H</em><sub>1</sub>. If you really wanted to know whether or not the die was loaded, you would need to roll it a few more times until the evidence in favor of one hypothesis or the other was great enough for you to make a stronger decision.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now let’s look at a second example of using the Bayes factor to determine the strength of our beliefs.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch16lev3sec2"><strong>Self-Diagnosing Rare Diseases Online</strong></h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Many people have made the mistake of looking up their symptoms and ailments online late at night, only to find themselves glued to the screen in terror, sure they are the victim of some strange and terrible disease! Unfortunately for them, their analysis almost always excludes Bayesian reasoning, which might help alleviate some unnecessary anxiety. In this example, let’s assume you’ve made the mistake of looking up your symptoms and have found two possible ailments that fit. Rather than panicking for no reason, you’ll use posterior odds to weigh the odds of each.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_163"/>Suppose you wake up one day with difficulty hearing and a ringing (tinnitus) in one ear. It annoys you all day, and when you get home from work, you decide it’s high time to search the web for potential causes of your symptoms. You become increasingly concerned, and finally come to two possible hypotheses:</p>&#13;
<p class="hangt"><strong>Earwax impaction</strong> You have too much earwax in one ear. A quick visit to the doctor will clear up this condition.</p>&#13;
<p class="hangb"><strong>Vestibular schwannoma</strong> You have a brain tumor growing on the myelin sheath of the vestibular nerve, causing irreversible hearing loss and possibly requiring brain surgery.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Of the two, the possibility of vestibular schwannoma is the most worrying. Sure, it could be just earwax, but what if it’s not? What if you <em>do</em> have a brain tumor? Since you’re most worried about the possibility of a brain tumor, you decide to make this your <em>H</em><sub>1</sub>. Your <em>H</em><sub>2</sub> is the hypothesis that you have too much earwax in one ear.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s see if posterior odds can calm you down.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As in our last example, we’ll start our exploration by looking at the likelihood of observing these symptoms if each hypothesis were true, and compute the Bayes factor. This means we need to compute <em>P</em>(<em>D</em> | <em>H</em>). You’ve observed two symptoms: hearing loss and tinnitus.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For vestibular schwannoma, the probability of experiencing hearing loss is 94 percent, and the probability of experiencing tinnitus is 83 percent, which means the probability of having hearing loss and tinnitus if you have vestibular schwannoma is:</p>&#13;
<p class="equ"><em>P</em> (<em>D</em> | <em>H</em><sub>1</sub>) = 0.94 × 0.89 = 0.78</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Next, we’ll do the same for <em>H</em><sub>2</sub>. For earwax impaction, the probability of experiencing hearing loss is 63 percent, and the probability of experiencing tinnitus is 55 percent. The likelihood of having your symptoms if you have impacted earwax is:</p>&#13;
<p class="equ"><em>P</em> (<em>D</em> | <em>H</em><sub>2</sub>) = 0.63 × 0.55 = 0.35</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now we have enough information to look at our Bayes factor:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0163-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Yikes! Looking at just the Bayes factor doesn’t do much to help alleviate your concerns of having a brain tumor. Taking only the likelihood ratio into account, it appears that you’re more than twice as likely to experience these symptoms if you have vestibular schwannoma than if you have earwax impaction! Luckily, we’re not done with our analysis yet.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The next step is to determine the prior odds of each hypothesis. Symptoms aside, how likely is it for someone to have one issue versus the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_164"/>other? We can find epidemiological data for each of these diseases. It turns out that vestibular schwannoma is a rare condition. Only 11 in 1,000,000 people contract it each year. The prior odds look like this:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0164-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Unsurprisingly, earwax impaction is much, much more common, with 37,000 cases per 1,000,000 people in a year:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0164-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">To get the prior odds for <em>H</em><sub>1</sub>, we need to look at the ratio of these two prior probabilities:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0164-03.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Based on prior information alone, a given person is about 3,700 times more likely to have an earwax impaction than vestibular schwannoma. But before you can breathe easy, we need to compute the full posterior odds. This just means multiplying our Bayes factor by our prior odds:</p>&#13;
<div class="equ-image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/f0164-04.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">This result shows that <em>H</em><sub>2</sub> is about 1,659 times more likely than <em>H</em><sub>1</sub>. Finally, you can relax, knowing that a visit to the doctor in the morning for a simple ear cleaning will likely clear all this up!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In everyday reasoning, it’s easy to overestimate the probability of scary situations, but by using Bayesian reasoning, we can break down the real risks and see how likely they actually are.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch16lev1sec3"><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned how to use the Bayes factor and posterior odds to compare two hypotheses. Rather than focusing on providing data to support our beliefs, the Bayes factor tests how well our beliefs support the data we’ve observed. The result is a ratio that reflects how many times better one hypothesis explains the data than the other. We can use it to strengthen our prior beliefs when they explain the data better than alternative beliefs. On the other hand, when the result is a fraction, we might want to consider changing our minds.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch16lev1sec4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_165"/><strong>Exercises</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Try answering the following questions to see how well you understand the Bayes factor and posterior odds. The solutions can be found at <em><a href="https://nostarch.com/learnbayes/">https://nostarch.com/learnbayes/</a></em>.</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Returning to the dice problem, assume that your friend made a mistake and suddenly realized that there were, in fact, two loaded dice and only one fair die. How does this change the prior, and therefore the posterior odds, for our problem? Are you more willing to believe that the die being rolled is the loaded die?</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Returning to the rare diseases example, suppose you go to the doctor, and after having your ears cleaned you notice that your symptoms persist. Even worse, you have a new symptom: vertigo. The doctor proposes another possible explanation, labyrinthitis, which is a viral infection of the inner ear in which 98 percent of cases involve vertigo. However, hearing loss and tinnitus are less common in this disease; hearing loss occurs only 30 percent of the time, and tinnitus occurs only 28 percent of the time. Vertigo is also a possible symptom of vestibular schwannoma, but occurs in only 49 percent of cases. In the general population, 35 people per million contract labyrinthitis annually. What is the posterior odds when you compare the hypothesis that you have labyrinthitis against the hypothesis that you have vestibular schwannoma?<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_166"/></li>&#13;

- en: In this chapter, we’ll cover drafting, which is the process of creating technical
    drawings. Ideally, you’d be able to send a file containing your 3D model off to
    a machine shop or manufacturer to have it made, but in the real world, that’s
    rarely sufficient. Some of the reasons for this are practical. The manufacturer
    might not use the same CAD software as you do, in which case they couldn’t even
    open your original model file. It’s also entirely possible that they won’t use
    CAD at all.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Manual machining is still very common; the manufacturer might not touch a computer
    when they make your part. Even if they do use CAD, many shops prefer to re-create
    a 3D model themselves using a system that works better with their machine tools.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But beyond practical concerns, the truth is that a 3D model alone doesn’t convey
    all of the information needed for manufacturing. A model like the one shown in
    [Figure 8-1](ch08.xhtml#ch08fig1) only tells the manufacturer what the basic geometry
    looks like. Other details, like tolerances and surface finish, affect the part
    too, which is where technical drawings come in. For instance, if you want the
    shop to clean up the rough edges of a part after it has been machined, you would
    write “Deburr all edges” on a technical drawing to indicate that.

    different lines to the typefaces used for text. Luckily, in the real world, few
    people care about the vast majority of those rules.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, American National Standards Institute (ANSI) rules state that the
    text height for technical drawings should be 1/8 inch. That’s a good rule to follow
    if you remember it, but if you send a drawing to a manufacturer with a 3/16-inch
    text height instead, they wouldn’t reject the drawing. Drafting as a discipline
    is full of example s like that. There are rules and guidelines for every single
    detail of a technical drawing, but at the end of the day, what matters is that
    the people you send it to can easily and correctly interpret it.

    ability to make your model. These aspects matter the most, and while there are

    yourself with them so you’ll be able to check the quality of your drawings before
    you send them out.

    on the standards the drawing is following. The big architectural blueprints you
    often see in pop culture, called Architectural E size drawings, are 48 inches
    by 36 inches, while a standard piece of 8.5-by-11-inch printer paper is called
    an ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) A size.

- en: Scale, or the relationship between the size of your drawing and the size of
    the object, is one of the most crucial details of a technical drawing—and one
    that many novices overlook. Getting the scale right matters, because someone should
    be able to measure the drawing if they need to get information about the size
    of some part. If your part is 1 inch long and has a 1:1 scale, then it should
    be exactly 1 inch long in the drawing. The drawing would show the part as 2 inches
    long if you were using a 2:1 scale.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While that’s an easy concept to grasp, a few factors could end up making the
    scale of your drawing inaccurate. The most obvious of these is forgetting to note
    when different parts of the drawing have different scales. The drawing’s *title
    block*, in the bottom-right corner of the page, shows the drawing’s overall scale,
    which applies to every view unless otherwise stated. Sometimes, though, the drawing
    will show the same object from multiple views, and it’s commonplace for one view
    to have its own larger scale to more clearly show the detail of some feature.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If an individual view scale differs from the scale of the overall drawing, you
    must note it in that view’s title. Fusion 360 will keep track of those scales
    for you in the views’ Properties dialogs, but you’ll have to type them into the
    text description of the views. The drawing in [Figure 8-2](ch08.xhtml#ch08fig2)
    has an overall scale of 1:1, but one of its views has an individually set scale
    of 2:1.

    as a PDF. On most computers, it’s pretty common for the print utility to automatically
    enlarge the document so it fills the entire page or reduce its size so it fits
    onto one sheet. That will throw off your scale, so make sure the software doesn’t
    do any scaling. You can do that by saving the PDF and printing it at “Actual Size.”

- en: A tolerance tells the manufacturer how precisely it needs to adhere to the dimensions
    shown on your drawing (called nominal dimensions). You might have modeled a cube
    so each side is 50 mm long, but maybe the object doesn’t need to meet those measurements
    exactly. Even the world’s most high-tech manufacturing is imperfect; that’s just
    the nature of physical objects. Tolerance lets the manufacturer know how closely
    it needs to stick to your nominal dimension in order for you to accept the part.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let’s say that 50 mm cube is a stand-alone toy. In that case, it’s not important
    for each side to measure exactly 50 mm, so you might specify a tolerance of ±0.1
    mm. That “plus or minus” symbol tells the manufacturer that you’ll accept the
    part if the sides measure anything from 49.9 mm to 50.1 mm. That loose tolerance
    gives the manufacturer more flexibility in its machining options and makes it
    easier for parts to pass quality control, potentially lowering what you pay per
    part.

    where it will mate with the cylinder of a second part. In order to ensure the
    cylinder fits inside without leaving too much extra room, you might give the hole
    a much smaller tolerance of +0.01 mm, as shown in [Figure 8-6](ch08.xhtml#ch08fig6).
    The machinist will then know that they can make that hole measure anything between
    25 mm and 25.01 mm. They’ll know not to go below 25 mm, or the cylinder won’t
    fit.

    However, if you did want an isometric view, you’d simply add another properly

    but you’ll sometimes have to create assembly drawings, which illustrate how multiple
    parts fit together. Create one now from the complete Hinge Assembly. It should
    end up looking something like [Figure 8-17](ch08.xhtml#ch08fig17).

- en: You’ll have to create an *exploded view* of the assembly, which shows how the
    separated parts fit together. To do this, go to the **Animation** workspace, click
    **Auto Explode** from the main toolbar, and then save the assembly. If needed,
    you can reorient the model and save it as a new home view by right-clicking the
    View Cube. Then, when you create the drawing, choose the **From Animation** option
    to use that exploded view.

- en: You also have to add the *bill of materials* (BOM), which is a table at the
    top of the drawing that shows your parts list. To create that, choose **Table**
    from the main **Drawing** toolbar. Once you place the table, your parts will automatically
    populate it. Part Number, Description, and Material are all controlled by the
    properties accessible from the Component Browser in the Model workspace. Then
    just place balloons (from the same menu) to label each part in the drawing.

- en: Technical drawings are very complex, and drafting as a profession takes years
    to master. Luckily, 3D CAD software like Fusion 360 has made the process a lot
    easier. Using the skills you’ve learned in this chapter, you should be able to
    create clear and professional technical drawings that real manufacturers can use
    to make your designs. In [Chapter 9](ch09.xhtml#ch09), you’ll learn how to make
    high-quality renders of your designs for presentations.

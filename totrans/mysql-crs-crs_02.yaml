    that the client side needs to access. This means that, in a live production environment,
    the server software (MySQL Community Server) would run on a dedicated computer
    housing the MySQL database. The tools used to access the database, MySQL Workbench
    and the MySQL command line client, would reside on the user’s computer.

    install both the MySQL client tools and the MySQL Community Server software on
    the same computer. In other words, your computer will act as both the client and
    the server.

    Click **MySQL Documentation**, and under the MySQL Server heading, click **MySQL
    Reference Manual** and select the most recent version. You’ll then be taken to
    the reference manual for that version. On the left-hand menu, click **Installing
    and Upgrading MySQL**. Find your operating system in the table of contents and
    follow the instructions to download and install MySQL Community Server.

    word *web*, as highlighted in the figure. I recommend choosing this option because
    it allows you to select the MySQL products you want to install, and it downloads
    them from the web. The full bundle installer contains all MySQL products, which
    shouldn’t be necessary.

    to access MySQL databases. With this tool, you can explore your database, run
    SQL statements against that database, and review the data that gets returned.
    To download MySQL Workbench, go to [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/).
    This takes you directly to the MySQL Workbench reference manual. Click **Installation**
    in the left-hand menu, choose your operating system, and follow the instructions.

    the MySQL command line client should be installed automatically. This client allows
    you to connect to a MySQL database from the *command line interface* of your computer
    (also called the *console*, *command prompt*, or *terminal*). You can use this
    tool to run a SQL statement, or many SQL statements saved in a script file, against
    a MySQL database. The MySQL command line client is useful in situations where
    you don’t need to see your results in a nicely formatted graphical user interface.

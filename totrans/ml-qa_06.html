<div class="image1"><img src="../images/common.jpg" alt="Image" width="252" height="252"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Suppose we train a neural network classifier in a supervised fashion and notice that it suffers from overfitting. What are some of the common ways to reduce overfitting in neural networks through the use of altered or additional data?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><em>Overfitting</em>, a common problem in machine learning, occurs when a model fits the training data too closely, learning its noise and outliers rather than the underlying pattern. As a result, the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen or test data. While it is ideal to prevent overfitting, it’s often not possible to completely eliminate it. Instead, we aim to reduce or minimize overfitting as much as possible.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The most successful techniques for reducing overfitting revolve around collecting more high-quality labeled data. However, if collecting more labeled data is not feasible, we can augment the existing data or leverage unlabeled data for pretraining.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_24"/></p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev21"><strong>Common Methods</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This chapter summarizes the most prominent examples of dataset-related techniques that have stood the test of time, grouping them into the following categories: collecting more data, data augmentation, and pretraining.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00levsec1"><em><strong>Collecting More Data</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">One of the best ways to reduce overfitting is to collect more (good-quality) data. We can plot learning curves to find out whether a given model would benefit from more data. To construct a learning curve, we train the model to different training set sizes (10 percent, 20 percent, and so on) and evaluate the trained model on the same fixed-size validation or test set. As shown in <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig1">Figure 5-1</a>, the validation accuracy increases as the training set sizes increase. This indicates that we can improve the model’s performance by collecting more data.</p>&#13;

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 5-1: The learning curve plot of a model fit to different training set sizes</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The gap between training and validation performance indicates the degree of overfitting—the more extensive the gap, the more overfitting occurs. Conversely, the slope indicating an improvement in the validation performance suggests the model is underfitting and can benefit from more data. Typically, additional data can decrease both underfitting and overfitting.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00levsec2"><em><strong>Data Augmentation</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Data augmentation refers to generating new data records or features based on existing data. It allows for the expansion of a dataset without additional data collection.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Data augmentation allows us to create different versions of the original input data, which can improve the model’s generalization performance. Why? Augmented data can help the model improve its ability to generalize, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_25"/>since it makes it harder to memorize spurious information via training examples or features—or, in the case of image data, exact pixel values for specific pixel locations. <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig2">Figure 5-2</a> highlights common image data augmentation techniques, including increasing brightness, flipping, and cropping.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch5fig2" src="../images/05fig02.jpg" alt="Image" width="817" height="575"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 5-2: A selection of different image data augmentation techniques</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Data augmentation is usually standard for image data (see <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch5fig2">Figure 5-2</a>) and text data (discussed further in <a href="ch15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a>), but data augmentation methods for tabular data also exist.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Instead of collecting more data or augmenting existing data, it is also possible to generate new, synthetic data. While more common for image data and text, generating synthetic data is also possible for tabular datasets.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00levsec3"><em><strong>Pretraining</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">As discussed in <a href="ch02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, self-supervised learning lets us leverage large, unlabeled datasets to pretrain neural networks. This can also help reduce over-fitting on the smaller target datasets.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As an alternative to self-supervised learning, traditional transfer learning on large labeled datasets is also an option. Transfer learning is most effective if the labeled dataset is closely related to the target domain. For instance, if we train a model to classify bird species, we can pretrain a network on a large, general animal classification dataset. However, if such a large animal classification dataset is unavailable, we can also pretrain the model on the relatively broad ImageNet dataset.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A dataset may be extremely small and unsuitable for supervised learning—for example, if it contains only a handful of labeled examples per class. If our classifier needs to operate in a context where the collection of additional labeled data is not feasible, we may also consider few-shot learning.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_26"/></p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev22"><strong>Other Methods</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The previous sections covered the main approaches to using and modifying datasets to reduce overfitting. However, this is not an exhaustive list. Other common techniques include:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Feature engineering and normalization</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">The inclusion of adversarial examples and label or feature noise</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Label smoothing</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Smaller batch sizes</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Data augmentation techniques such as Mixup, Cutout, and CutMix</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="indent">The next chapter covers additional techniques to reduce overfitting from a model perspective, and it concludes by discussing which regularization techniques we should consider in practice.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev23"><strong>Exercises</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="number"><strong>5-1.</strong> Suppose we train an XGBoost model to classify images based on manually extracted features obtained from collaborators. The dataset of labeled training examples is relatively small, but fortunately, our collaborators also have a labeled training set from an older project on a related domain. We’re considering implementing a transfer learning approach to train the XGBoost model. Is this a feasible option? If so, how could we do it? (Assume we are allowed to use only XGBoost and not another classification algorithm or model.)</p>&#13;
<p class="number"><strong>5-2.</strong> Suppose we’re working on the image classification problem of implementing MNIST-based handwritten digit recognition. We’ve added a decent amount of data augmentation to try to reduce overfitting. Unfortunately, we find that the classification accuracy is much worse than it was before the augmentation. What are some potential reasons for this?</p>&#13;

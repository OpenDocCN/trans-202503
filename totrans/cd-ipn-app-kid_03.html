<div class="image1"><img src="Image00001.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">A “<a href="text00011.html#ch01">Hello, world!</a>
 ” app is no small accomplishment, but now it’s time to really learn how to write some code. Xcode provides a special type of document called a <em>playground</em>
 , which is a great place to learn how to program. In a playground, you can write and run code immediately to see the results, without going through the trouble of writing a whole app, as we did in <a href="text00011.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s open a playground. Open Xcode and select <strong>Get started with a playground</strong>
 , as shown in the Welcome to Xcode dialog in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig1">Figure 2-1</a>
 . If this window doesn’t automatically open, select <strong>Welcome to Xcode</strong>
 from the Window option in the menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -1.</p>

</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll be asked to name your playground (<a href="text00012.html#ch02fig2">Figure 2-2</a>
 ). In this example, we’ll keep the default name <em>MyPlayground</em>
 . Make sure that you choose iOS as the platform to run the playground.</p>

<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig2"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-2: Naming the playground and selecting the platform</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">When the playground first opens, you’ll see two panels in the window, just like in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 . On the left is the playground editor, where you’ll write your code. On the right is the results sidebar, which displays the results of your code.</p>
<p class="indent">The line <span class="code">var str = "Hello, playground"</span>
 in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . A <em>variable</em>
 is like a container; you can use it to hold almost anything—a simple number, a string of letters, or a complex object (we’ll explain what that is later). Let’s take a closer look at how variables work.</p>

<strong>CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here’s the line of code from <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 again:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00037.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">It does two things. First, it creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . This is called a <em>declaration</em>
 because we are declaring that we would like to create a variable. To create a variable, you type the word <span class="code">var</span>
 and then type a name for your variable—this case, <span class="code">str</span>
 . There are some rules when naming variables, which we’ll go over later, so for now stick with this example.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, this line of code gives a value of <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 to <span class="code">str</span>
 using the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator. This is called an <em>assignment</em>
 because we are assigning a value to our newly created variable. Remember, you can think of a variable as a container that holds something. So now we have a container named <span class="code">str</span>
 that holds <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can read this line of code as “the variable <span class="code">str</span>
 equals <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 .” As you can see, Swift is often very readable; this line of code practically tells you in English what it’s doing.</p>
<p class="indent">Variables are handy because if you want to print the words “Hello, playground” all you have to do is use the command <span class="code">print</span>
 on <span class="code">str</span>
 , like in the following code:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00038.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This prints <span class="code">"Hello, playground\n"</span>
 in the results sidebar. The <span class="code">\n</span>
 is added automatically to the end of whatever you print. It is known as the <em>newline</em>
 character and tells the computer to go to a new line.</p>
<p class="indent">To see the results of your program as it would actually run, bring up the debug area, which will appear below the two panels, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>
 . To do this, go to <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 in the Xcode menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y. When <span class="code">str</span>
 is printed in the console of the debug area, you can see that the quotes around <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 and the newline character don’t appear. This is what <span class="code">str</span>
 would really look like if you were to officially run this program!</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_20"></span>
 <img src="Image00039.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig4"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-4: Viewing the real output of your program in the debug area</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>
 .</p>

<em>In the playground, an error will appear as a red circle with a tiny white circle inside it. Clicking the error mark will show the error message and tell you what’s wrong.

</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />

<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>

 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00075.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>

<h2 class="h2a">LEARNING TO CODE IN A PLAYGROUND</h2>
<div class="image1"><img src="Image00001.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="noindent">A “<a href="text00011.html#ch01">Hello, world!</a>
 ” app is no small accomplishment, but now it’s time to really learn how to write some code. Xcode provides a special type of document called a <em>playground</em>
 , which is a great place to learn how to program. In a playground, you can write and run code immediately to see the results, without going through the trouble of writing a whole app, as we did in <a href="text00011.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s open a playground. Open Xcode and select <strong>Get started with a playground</strong>
 , as shown in the Welcome to Xcode dialog in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig1">Figure 2-1</a>
 . If this window doesn’t automatically open, select <strong>Welcome to Xcode</strong>
 from the Window option in the menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -1.</p>

</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll be asked to name your playground (<a href="text00012.html#ch02fig2">Figure 2-2</a>
 ). In this example, we’ll keep the default name <em>MyPlayground</em>
 . Make sure that you choose iOS as the platform to run the playground.</p>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig2"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-2: Naming the playground and selecting the platform</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">When the playground first opens, you’ll see two panels in the window, just like in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 . On the left is the playground editor, where you’ll write your code. On the right is the results sidebar, which displays the results of your code.</p>
<p class="indent">The line <span class="code">var str = "Hello, playground"</span>
 in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . A <em>variable</em>
 is like a container; you can use it to hold almost anything—a simple number, a string of letters, or a complex object (we’ll explain what that is later). Let’s take a closer look at how variables work.</p>

<strong>CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here’s the line of code from <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 again:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00037.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">It does two things. First, it creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . This is called a <em>declaration</em>
 because we are declaring that we would like to create a variable. To create a variable, you type the word <span class="code">var</span>
 and then type a name for your variable—this case, <span class="code">str</span>
 . There are some rules when naming variables, which we’ll go over later, so for now stick with this example.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, this line of code gives a value of <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 to <span class="code">str</span>
 using the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator. This is called an <em>assignment</em>
 because we are assigning a value to our newly created variable. Remember, you can think of a variable as a container that holds something. So now we have a container named <span class="code">str</span>
 that holds <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can read this line of code as “the variable <span class="code">str</span>
 equals <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 .” As you can see, Swift is often very readable; this line of code practically tells you in English what it’s doing.</p>
<p class="indent">Variables are handy because if you want to print the words “Hello, playground” all you have to do is use the command <span class="code">print</span>
 on <span class="code">str</span>
 , like in the following code:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00038.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This prints <span class="code">"Hello, playground\n"</span>
 in the results sidebar. The <span class="code">\n</span>
 is added automatically to the end of whatever you print. It is known as the <em>newline</em>
 character and tells the computer to go to a new line.</p>
<p class="indent">To see the results of your program as it would actually run, bring up the debug area, which will appear below the two panels, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>
 . To do this, go to <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 in the Xcode menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y. When <span class="code">str</span>
 is printed in the console of the debug area, you can see that the quotes around <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 and the newline character don’t appear. This is what <span class="code">str</span>
 would really look like if you were to officially run this program!</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_20"></span>
 <img src="Image00039.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig4"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-4: Viewing the real output of your program in the debug area</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>
 .</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>

<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

</div>
<p class="noindent">A “<a href="text00011.html#ch01">Hello, world!</a>
 ” app is no small accomplishment, but now it’s time to really learn how to write some code. Xcode provides a special type of document called a <em>playground</em>
 , which is a great place to learn how to program. In a playground, you can write and run code immediately to see the results, without going through the trouble of writing a whole app, as we did in <a href="text00011.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s open a playground. Open Xcode and select <strong>Get started with a playground</strong>
 , as shown in the Welcome to Xcode dialog in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig1">Figure 2-1</a>
 . If this window doesn’t automatically open, select <strong>Welcome to Xcode</strong>
 from the Window option in the menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll be asked to name your playground (<a href="text00012.html#ch02fig2">Figure 2-2</a>
 ). In this example, we’ll keep the default name <em>MyPlayground</em>
 . Make sure that you choose iOS as the platform to run the playground.</p>

<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig2"></a>

<p class="indent">When the playground first opens, you’ll see two panels in the window, just like in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 . On the left is the playground editor, where you’ll write your code. On the right is the results sidebar, which displays the results of your code.</p>
<p class="indent">The line <span class="code">var str = "Hello, playground"</span>
 in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . A <em>variable</em>
 is like a container; you can use it to hold almost anything—a simple number, a string of letters, or a complex object (we’ll explain what that is later). Let’s take a closer look at how variables work.</p>

<strong>CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here’s the line of code from <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 again:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00037.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">It does two things. First, it creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . This is called a <em>declaration</em>
 because we are declaring that we would like to create a variable. To create a variable, you type the word <span class="code">var</span>
 and then type a name for your variable—this case, <span class="code">str</span>
 . There are some rules when naming variables, which we’ll go over later, so for now stick with this example.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, this line of code gives a value of <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 to <span class="code">str</span>
 using the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator. This is called an <em>assignment</em>
 because we are assigning a value to our newly created variable. Remember, you can think of a variable as a container that holds something. So now we have a container named <span class="code">str</span>
 that holds <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can read this line of code as “the variable <span class="code">str</span>
 equals <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 .” As you can see, Swift is often very readable; this line of code practically tells you in English what it’s doing.</p>
<p class="indent">Variables are handy because if you want to print the words “Hello, playground” all you have to do is use the command <span class="code">print</span>
 on <span class="code">str</span>
 , like in the following code:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00038.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This prints <span class="code">"Hello, playground\n"</span>
 in the results sidebar. The <span class="code">\n</span>
 is added automatically to the end of whatever you print. It is known as the <em>newline</em>
 character and tells the computer to go to a new line.</p>
<p class="indent">To see the results of your program as it would actually run, bring up the debug area, which will appear below the two panels, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>
 . To do this, go to <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 in the Xcode menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y. When <span class="code">str</span>
 is printed in the console of the debug area, you can see that the quotes around <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 and the newline character don’t appear. This is what <span class="code">str</span>
 would really look like if you were to officially run this program!</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_20"></span>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig4"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-4: Viewing the real output of your program in the debug area</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>
 .</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>

 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00075.jpg" alt="Image" />

<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">A “<a href="text00011.html#ch01">Hello, world!</a>
 ” app is no small accomplishment, but now it’s time to really learn how to write some code. Xcode provides a special type of document called a <em>playground</em>
 , which is a great place to learn how to program. In a playground, you can write and run code immediately to see the results, without going through the trouble of writing a whole app, as we did in <a href="text00011.html#ch01">Chapter 1</a>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s open a playground. Open Xcode and select <strong>Get started with a playground</strong>
 , as shown in the Welcome to Xcode dialog in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig1">Figure 2-1</a>
 . If this window doesn’t automatically open, select <strong>Welcome to Xcode</strong>
 from the Window option in the menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>

</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll be asked to name your playground (<a href="text00012.html#ch02fig2">Figure 2-2</a>
 ). In this example, we’ll keep the default name <em>MyPlayground</em>
 . Make sure that you choose iOS as the platform to run the playground.</p>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig2"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-2: Naming the playground and selecting the platform</em>

<p class="indent">When the playground first opens, you’ll see two panels in the window, just like in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 . On the left is the playground editor, where you’ll write your code. On the right is the results sidebar, which displays the results of your code.</p>
<p class="indent">The line <span class="code">var str = "Hello, playground"</span>
 in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . A <em>variable</em>
 is like a container; you can use it to hold almost anything—a simple number, a string of letters, or a complex object (we’ll explain what that is later). Let’s take a closer look at how variables work.</p>

<strong>CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here’s the line of code from <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 again:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00037.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">It does two things. First, it creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . This is called a <em>declaration</em>
 because we are declaring that we would like to create a variable. To create a variable, you type the word <span class="code">var</span>
 and then type a name for your variable—this case, <span class="code">str</span>
 . There are some rules when naming variables, which we’ll go over later, so for now stick with this example.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, this line of code gives a value of <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 to <span class="code">str</span>
 using the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator. This is called an <em>assignment</em>
 because we are assigning a value to our newly created variable. Remember, you can think of a variable as a container that holds something. So now we have a container named <span class="code">str</span>
 that holds <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can read this line of code as “the variable <span class="code">str</span>
 equals <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 .” As you can see, Swift is often very readable; this line of code practically tells you in English what it’s doing.</p>
<p class="indent">Variables are handy because if you want to print the words “Hello, playground” all you have to do is use the command <span class="code">print</span>
 on <span class="code">str</span>
 , like in the following code:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00038.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This prints <span class="code">"Hello, playground\n"</span>
 in the results sidebar. The <span class="code">\n</span>
 is added automatically to the end of whatever you print. It is known as the <em>newline</em>
 character and tells the computer to go to a new line.</p>
<p class="indent">To see the results of your program as it would actually run, bring up the debug area, which will appear below the two panels, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>
 . To do this, go to <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 in the Xcode menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y. When <span class="code">str</span>
 is printed in the console of the debug area, you can see that the quotes around <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 and the newline character don’t appear. This is what <span class="code">str</span>
 would really look like if you were to officially run this program!</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_20"></span>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig4"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-4: Viewing the real output of your program in the debug area</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>

<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

<p class="indent">Let’s open a playground. Open Xcode and select <strong>Get started with a playground</strong>
 , as shown in the Welcome to Xcode dialog in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig1">Figure 2-1</a>
 . If this window doesn’t automatically open, select <strong>Welcome to Xcode</strong>

<p class="indent">You’ll be asked to name your playground (<a href="text00012.html#ch02fig2">Figure 2-2</a>
 ). In this example, we’ll keep the default name <em>MyPlayground</em>
 . Make sure that you choose iOS as the platform to run the playground.</p>

<p class="indent">The line <span class="code">var str = "Hello, playground"</span>
 in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . A <em>variable</em>
 is like a container; you can use it to hold almost anything—a simple number, a string of letters, or a complex object (we’ll explain what that is later). Let’s take a closer look at how variables work.</p>

<strong>CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here’s the line of code from <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 again:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00037.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">It does two things. First, it creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . This is called a <em>declaration</em>
 because we are declaring that we would like to create a variable. To create a variable, you type the word <span class="code">var</span>
 and then type a name for your variable—this case, <span class="code">str</span>
 . There are some rules when naming variables, which we’ll go over later, so for now stick with this example.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, this line of code gives a value of <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 to <span class="code">str</span>
 using the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator. This is called an <em>assignment</em>
 because we are assigning a value to our newly created variable. Remember, you can think of a variable as a container that holds something. So now we have a container named <span class="code">str</span>
 that holds <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can read this line of code as “the variable <span class="code">str</span>
 equals <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 .” As you can see, Swift is often very readable; this line of code practically tells you in English what it’s doing.</p>
<p class="indent">Variables are handy because if you want to print the words “Hello, playground” all you have to do is use the command <span class="code">print</span>
 on <span class="code">str</span>
 , like in the following code:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00038.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This prints <span class="code">"Hello, playground\n"</span>
 in the results sidebar. The <span class="code">\n</span>
 is added automatically to the end of whatever you print. It is known as the <em>newline</em>
 character and tells the computer to go to a new line.</p>
<p class="indent">To see the results of your program as it would actually run, bring up the debug area, which will appear below the two panels, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>
 . To do this, go to <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 in the Xcode menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y. When <span class="code">str</span>
 is printed in the console of the debug area, you can see that the quotes around <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 and the newline character don’t appear. This is what <span class="code">str</span>
 would really look like if you were to officially run this program!</p>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig4"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-4: Viewing the real output of your program in the debug area</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>
 .</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

 <em>Figure 2-1: Getting started with a playground</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll be asked to name your playground (<a href="text00012.html#ch02fig2">Figure 2-2</a>
 ). In this example, we’ll keep the default name <em>MyPlayground</em>
 . Make sure that you choose iOS as the platform to run the playground.</p>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig2"></a>

</p>
<p class="indent">When the playground first opens, you’ll see two panels in the window, just like in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 . On the left is the playground editor, where you’ll write your code. On the right is the results sidebar, which displays the results of your code.</p>
<p class="indent">The line <span class="code">var str = "Hello, playground"</span>
 in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . A <em>variable</em>
 is like a container; you can use it to hold almost anything—a simple number, a string of letters, or a complex object (we’ll explain what that is later). Let’s take a closer look at how variables work.</p>

<strong>CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here’s the line of code from <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 again:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00037.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">It does two things. First, it creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . This is called a <em>declaration</em>
 because we are declaring that we would like to create a variable. To create a variable, you type the word <span class="code">var</span>
 and then type a name for your variable—this case, <span class="code">str</span>
 . There are some rules when naming variables, which we’ll go over later, so for now stick with this example.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, this line of code gives a value of <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 to <span class="code">str</span>
 using the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator. This is called an <em>assignment</em>
 because we are assigning a value to our newly created variable. Remember, you can think of a variable as a container that holds something. So now we have a container named <span class="code">str</span>
 that holds <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can read this line of code as “the variable <span class="code">str</span>
 equals <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 .” As you can see, Swift is often very readable; this line of code practically tells you in English what it’s doing.</p>
<p class="indent">Variables are handy because if you want to print the words “Hello, playground” all you have to do is use the command <span class="code">print</span>
 on <span class="code">str</span>
 , like in the following code:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00038.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This prints <span class="code">"Hello, playground\n"</span>
 in the results sidebar. The <span class="code">\n</span>
 is added automatically to the end of whatever you print. It is known as the <em>newline</em>
 character and tells the computer to go to a new line.</p>
<p class="indent">To see the results of your program as it would actually run, bring up the debug area, which will appear below the two panels, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>
 . To do this, go to <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 in the Xcode menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y. When <span class="code">str</span>
 is printed in the console of the debug area, you can see that the quotes around <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 and the newline character don’t appear. This is what <span class="code">str</span>
 would really look like if you were to officially run this program!</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_20"></span>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig4"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-4: Viewing the real output of your program in the debug area</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>

<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

</body>

<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig1"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-1: Getting started with a playground</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">You’ll be asked to name your playground (<a href="text00012.html#ch02fig2">Figure 2-2</a>
 ). In this example, we’ll keep the default name <em>MyPlayground</em>
 . Make sure that you choose iOS as the platform to run the playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00034.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig2"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-2: Naming the playground and selecting the platform</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">When the playground first opens, you’ll see two panels in the window, just like in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 . On the left is the playground editor, where you’ll write your code. On the right is the results sidebar, which displays the results of your code.</p>
<p class="indent">The line <span class="code">var str = "Hello, playground"</span>
 in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . A <em>variable</em>
 is like a container; you can use it to hold almost anything—a simple number, a string of letters, or a complex object (we’ll explain what that is later). Let’s take a closer look at how variables work.</p>

<strong>CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here’s the line of code from <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 again:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00037.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">It does two things. First, it creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . This is called a <em>declaration</em>
 because we are declaring that we would like to create a variable. To create a variable, you type the word <span class="code">var</span>
 and then type a name for your variable—this case, <span class="code">str</span>
 . There are some rules when naming variables, which we’ll go over later, so for now stick with this example.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, this line of code gives a value of <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 to <span class="code">str</span>
 using the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator. This is called an <em>assignment</em>
 because we are assigning a value to our newly created variable. Remember, you can think of a variable as a container that holds something. So now we have a container named <span class="code">str</span>
 that holds <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can read this line of code as “the variable <span class="code">str</span>
 equals <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 .” As you can see, Swift is often very readable; this line of code practically tells you in English what it’s doing.</p>
<p class="indent">Variables are handy because if you want to print the words “Hello, playground” all you have to do is use the command <span class="code">print</span>
 on <span class="code">str</span>
 , like in the following code:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00038.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This prints <span class="code">"Hello, playground\n"</span>
 in the results sidebar. The <span class="code">\n</span>
 is added automatically to the end of whatever you print. It is known as the <em>newline</em>
 character and tells the computer to go to a new line.</p>
<p class="indent">To see the results of your program as it would actually run, bring up the debug area, which will appear below the two panels, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>
 . To do this, go to <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 in the Xcode menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y. When <span class="code">str</span>
 is printed in the console of the debug area, you can see that the quotes around <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 and the newline character don’t appear. This is what <span class="code">str</span>
 would really look like if you were to officially run this program!</p>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig4"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-4: Viewing the real output of your program in the debug area</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>
 .</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">You’ll be asked to name your playground (<a href="text00012.html#ch02fig2">Figure 2-2</a>
 ). In this example, we’ll keep the default name <em>MyPlayground</em>
 . Make sure that you choose iOS as the platform to run the playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00034.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig2"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-2: Naming the playground and selecting the platform</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">When the playground first opens, you’ll see two panels in the window, just like in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 . On the left is the playground editor, where you’ll write your code. On the right is the results sidebar, which displays the results of your code.</p>
<p class="indent">The line <span class="code">var str = "Hello, playground"</span>
 in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . A <em>variable</em>
 is like a container; you can use it to hold almost anything—a simple number, a string of letters, or a complex object (we’ll explain what that is later). Let’s take a closer look at how variables work.</p>

<strong>CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here’s the line of code from <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 again:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00037.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">It does two things. First, it creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . This is called a <em>declaration</em>
 because we are declaring that we would like to create a variable. To create a variable, you type the word <span class="code">var</span>
 and then type a name for your variable—this case, <span class="code">str</span>
 . There are some rules when naming variables, which we’ll go over later, so for now stick with this example.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, this line of code gives a value of <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 to <span class="code">str</span>
 using the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator. This is called an <em>assignment</em>
 because we are assigning a value to our newly created variable. Remember, you can think of a variable as a container that holds something. So now we have a container named <span class="code">str</span>
 that holds <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can read this line of code as “the variable <span class="code">str</span>
 equals <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 .” As you can see, Swift is often very readable; this line of code practically tells you in English what it’s doing.</p>
<p class="indent">Variables are handy because if you want to print the words “Hello, playground” all you have to do is use the command <span class="code">print</span>
 on <span class="code">str</span>
 , like in the following code:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00038.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This prints <span class="code">"Hello, playground\n"</span>
 in the results sidebar. The <span class="code">\n</span>
 is added automatically to the end of whatever you print. It is known as the <em>newline</em>
 character and tells the computer to go to a new line.</p>
<p class="indent">To see the results of your program as it would actually run, bring up the debug area, which will appear below the two panels, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>
 . To do this, go to <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 in the Xcode menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y. When <span class="code">str</span>
 is printed in the console of the debug area, you can see that the quotes around <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 and the newline character don’t appear. This is what <span class="code">str</span>
 would really look like if you were to officially run this program!</p>

 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>

<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig2"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-2: Naming the playground and selecting the platform</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">When the playground first opens, you’ll see two panels in the window, just like in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 . On the left is the playground editor, where you’ll write your code. On the right is the results sidebar, which displays the results of your code.</p>
<p class="indent">The line <span class="code">var str = "Hello, playground"</span>
 in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . A <em>variable</em>
 is like a container; you can use it to hold almost anything—a simple number, a string of letters, or a complex object (we’ll explain what that is later). Let’s take a closer look at how variables work.</p>

<strong>CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here’s the line of code from <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 again:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00037.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">It does two things. First, it creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . This is called a <em>declaration</em>
 because we are declaring that we would like to create a variable. To create a variable, you type the word <span class="code">var</span>
 and then type a name for your variable—this case, <span class="code">str</span>
 . There are some rules when naming variables, which we’ll go over later, so for now stick with this example.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, this line of code gives a value of <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 to <span class="code">str</span>
 using the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator. This is called an <em>assignment</em>
 because we are assigning a value to our newly created variable. Remember, you can think of a variable as a container that holds something. So now we have a container named <span class="code">str</span>
 that holds <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can read this line of code as “the variable <span class="code">str</span>
 equals <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 .” As you can see, Swift is often very readable; this line of code practically tells you in English what it’s doing.</p>
<p class="indent">Variables are handy because if you want to print the words “Hello, playground” all you have to do is use the command <span class="code">print</span>
 on <span class="code">str</span>
 , like in the following code:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00038.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This prints <span class="code">"Hello, playground\n"</span>
 in the results sidebar. The <span class="code">\n</span>
 is added automatically to the end of whatever you print. It is known as the <em>newline</em>
 character and tells the computer to go to a new line.</p>
<p class="indent">To see the results of your program as it would actually run, bring up the debug area, which will appear below the two panels, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>
 . To do this, go to <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 in the Xcode menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y. When <span class="code">str</span>
 is printed in the console of the debug area, you can see that the quotes around <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 and the newline character don’t appear. This is what <span class="code">str</span>
 would really look like if you were to officially run this program!</p>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig4"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-4: Viewing the real output of your program in the debug area</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>
 .</p>

</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />

 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

</html>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig2"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-2: Naming the playground and selecting the platform</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">When the playground first opens, you’ll see two panels in the window, just like in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 . On the left is the playground editor, where you’ll write your code. On the right is the results sidebar, which displays the results of your code.</p>
<p class="indent">The line <span class="code">var str = "Hello, playground"</span>
 in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . A <em>variable</em>
 is like a container; you can use it to hold almost anything—a simple number, a string of letters, or a complex object (we’ll explain what that is later). Let’s take a closer look at how variables work.</p>

<strong>CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here’s the line of code from <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 again:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00037.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">It does two things. First, it creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . This is called a <em>declaration</em>
 because we are declaring that we would like to create a variable. To create a variable, you type the word <span class="code">var</span>
 and then type a name for your variable—this case, <span class="code">str</span>
 . There are some rules when naming variables, which we’ll go over later, so for now stick with this example.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, this line of code gives a value of <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 to <span class="code">str</span>
 using the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator. This is called an <em>assignment</em>
 because we are assigning a value to our newly created variable. Remember, you can think of a variable as a container that holds something. So now we have a container named <span class="code">str</span>
 that holds <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can read this line of code as “the variable <span class="code">str</span>
 equals <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 .” As you can see, Swift is often very readable; this line of code practically tells you in English what it’s doing.</p>
<p class="indent">Variables are handy because if you want to print the words “Hello, playground” all you have to do is use the command <span class="code">print</span>
 on <span class="code">str</span>
 , like in the following code:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00038.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This prints <span class="code">"Hello, playground\n"</span>
 in the results sidebar. The <span class="code">\n</span>
 is added automatically to the end of whatever you print. It is known as the <em>newline</em>
 character and tells the computer to go to a new line.</p>
<p class="indent">To see the results of your program as it would actually run, bring up the debug area, which will appear below the two panels, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>
 . To do this, go to <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 in the Xcode menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y. When <span class="code">str</span>
 is printed in the console of the debug area, you can see that the quotes around <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 and the newline character don’t appear. This is what <span class="code">str</span>
 would really look like if you were to officially run this program!</p>

 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>

<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00075.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">When the playground first opens, you’ll see two panels in the window, just like in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 . On the left is the playground editor, where you’ll write your code. On the right is the results sidebar, which displays the results of your code.</p>
<p class="indent">The line <span class="code">var str = "Hello, playground"</span>
 in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . A <em>variable</em>
 is like a container; you can use it to hold almost anything—a simple number, a string of letters, or a complex object (we’ll explain what that is later). Let’s take a closer look at how variables work.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00035.jpg" alt="Image" />

<strong>CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here’s the line of code from <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 again:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00037.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">It does two things. First, it creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . This is called a <em>declaration</em>
 because we are declaring that we would like to create a variable. To create a variable, you type the word <span class="code">var</span>
 and then type a name for your variable—this case, <span class="code">str</span>
 . There are some rules when naming variables, which we’ll go over later, so for now stick with this example.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, this line of code gives a value of <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 to <span class="code">str</span>
 using the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator. This is called an <em>assignment</em>
 because we are assigning a value to our newly created variable. Remember, you can think of a variable as a container that holds something. So now we have a container named <span class="code">str</span>
 that holds <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can read this line of code as “the variable <span class="code">str</span>
 equals <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 .” As you can see, Swift is often very readable; this line of code practically tells you in English what it’s doing.</p>
<p class="indent">Variables are handy because if you want to print the words “Hello, playground” all you have to do is use the command <span class="code">print</span>
 on <span class="code">str</span>
 , like in the following code:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00038.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This prints <span class="code">"Hello, playground\n"</span>
 in the results sidebar. The <span class="code">\n</span>
 is added automatically to the end of whatever you print. It is known as the <em>newline</em>
 character and tells the computer to go to a new line.</p>
<p class="indent">To see the results of your program as it would actually run, bring up the debug area, which will appear below the two panels, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>
 . To do this, go to <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 in the Xcode menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y. When <span class="code">str</span>
 is printed in the console of the debug area, you can see that the quotes around <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 and the newline character don’t appear. This is what <span class="code">str</span>
 would really look like if you were to officially run this program!</p>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig4"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-4: Viewing the real output of your program in the debug area</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>
 .</p>

</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

</html>
<p class="indent">The line <span class="code">var str = "Hello, playground"</span>
 in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . A <em>variable</em>
 is like a container; you can use it to hold almost anything—a simple number, a string of letters, or a complex object (we’ll explain what that is later). Let’s take a closer look at how variables work.</p>

<strong>CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here’s the line of code from <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 again:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00037.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">It does two things. First, it creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . This is called a <em>declaration</em>
 because we are declaring that we would like to create a variable. To create a variable, you type the word <span class="code">var</span>
 and then type a name for your variable—this case, <span class="code">str</span>
 . There are some rules when naming variables, which we’ll go over later, so for now stick with this example.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, this line of code gives a value of <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 to <span class="code">str</span>
 using the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator. This is called an <em>assignment</em>
 because we are assigning a value to our newly created variable. Remember, you can think of a variable as a container that holds something. So now we have a container named <span class="code">str</span>
 that holds <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can read this line of code as “the variable <span class="code">str</span>
 equals <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 .” As you can see, Swift is often very readable; this line of code practically tells you in English what it’s doing.</p>
<p class="indent">Variables are handy because if you want to print the words “Hello, playground” all you have to do is use the command <span class="code">print</span>
 on <span class="code">str</span>
 , like in the following code:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00038.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This prints <span class="code">"Hello, playground\n"</span>
 in the results sidebar. The <span class="code">\n</span>
 is added automatically to the end of whatever you print. It is known as the <em>newline</em>
 character and tells the computer to go to a new line.</p>
<p class="indent">To see the results of your program as it would actually run, bring up the debug area, which will appear below the two panels, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>
 . To do this, go to <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 in the Xcode menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y. When <span class="code">str</span>
 is printed in the console of the debug area, you can see that the quotes around <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 and the newline character don’t appear. This is what <span class="code">str</span>
 would really look like if you were to officially run this program!</p>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig4"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-4: Viewing the real output of your program in the debug area</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>

<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

<strong>CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here’s the line of code from <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 again:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00037.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">It does two things. First, it creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . This is called a <em>declaration</em>
 because we are declaring that we would like to create a variable. To create a variable, you type the word <span class="code">var</span>
 and then type a name for your variable—this case, <span class="code">str</span>
 . There are some rules when naming variables, which we’ll go over later, so for now stick with this example.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, this line of code gives a value of <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 to <span class="code">str</span>
 using the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator. This is called an <em>assignment</em>
 because we are assigning a value to our newly created variable. Remember, you can think of a variable as a container that holds something. So now we have a container named <span class="code">str</span>
 that holds <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can read this line of code as “the variable <span class="code">str</span>
 equals <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 .” As you can see, Swift is often very readable; this line of code practically tells you in English what it’s doing.</p>
<p class="indent">Variables are handy because if you want to print the words “Hello, playground” all you have to do is use the command <span class="code">print</span>
 on <span class="code">str</span>
 , like in the following code:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00038.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This prints <span class="code">"Hello, playground\n"</span>
 in the results sidebar. The <span class="code">\n</span>
 is added automatically to the end of whatever you print. It is known as the <em>newline</em>
 character and tells the computer to go to a new line.</p>
<p class="indent">To see the results of your program as it would actually run, bring up the debug area, which will appear below the two panels, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>
 . To do this, go to <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 in the Xcode menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y. When <span class="code">str</span>
 is printed in the console of the debug area, you can see that the quotes around <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 and the newline character don’t appear. This is what <span class="code">str</span>
 would really look like if you were to officially run this program!</p>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig4"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-4: Viewing the real output of your program in the debug area</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>
 .</p>

</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>

 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

<strong>CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here’s the line of code from <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 again:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00037.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">It does two things. First, it creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . This is called a <em>declaration</em>
 because we are declaring that we would like to create a variable. To create a variable, you type the word <span class="code">var</span>
 and then type a name for your variable—this case, <span class="code">str</span>
 . There are some rules when naming variables, which we’ll go over later, so for now stick with this example.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, this line of code gives a value of <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 to <span class="code">str</span>
 using the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator. This is called an <em>assignment</em>
 because we are assigning a value to our newly created variable. Remember, you can think of a variable as a container that holds something. So now we have a container named <span class="code">str</span>
 that holds <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can read this line of code as “the variable <span class="code">str</span>
 equals <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 .” As you can see, Swift is often very readable; this line of code practically tells you in English what it’s doing.</p>
<p class="indent">Variables are handy because if you want to print the words “Hello, playground” all you have to do is use the command <span class="code">print</span>
 on <span class="code">str</span>
 , like in the following code:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00038.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This prints <span class="code">"Hello, playground\n"</span>
 in the results sidebar. The <span class="code">\n</span>
 is added automatically to the end of whatever you print. It is known as the <em>newline</em>
 character and tells the computer to go to a new line.</p>
<p class="indent">To see the results of your program as it would actually run, bring up the debug area, which will appear below the two panels, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>
 . To do this, go to <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 in the Xcode menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y. When <span class="code">str</span>
 is printed in the console of the debug area, you can see that the quotes around <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 and the newline character don’t appear. This is what <span class="code">str</span>
 would really look like if you were to officially run this program!</p>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig4"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-4: Viewing the real output of your program in the debug area</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>

<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>

</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

<strong>CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here’s the line of code from <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 again:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00037.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">It does two things. First, it creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . This is called a <em>declaration</em>
 because we are declaring that we would like to create a variable. To create a variable, you type the word <span class="code">var</span>
 and then type a name for your variable—this case, <span class="code">str</span>
 . There are some rules when naming variables, which we’ll go over later, so for now stick with this example.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, this line of code gives a value of <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 to <span class="code">str</span>
 using the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator. This is called an <em>assignment</em>
 because we are assigning a value to our newly created variable. Remember, you can think of a variable as a container that holds something. So now we have a container named <span class="code">str</span>
 that holds <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can read this line of code as “the variable <span class="code">str</span>
 equals <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 .” As you can see, Swift is often very readable; this line of code practically tells you in English what it’s doing.</p>
<p class="indent">Variables are handy because if you want to print the words “Hello, playground” all you have to do is use the command <span class="code">print</span>
 on <span class="code">str</span>
 , like in the following code:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00038.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This prints <span class="code">"Hello, playground\n"</span>
 in the results sidebar. The <span class="code">\n</span>
 is added automatically to the end of whatever you print. It is known as the <em>newline</em>
 character and tells the computer to go to a new line.</p>
<p class="indent">To see the results of your program as it would actually run, bring up the debug area, which will appear below the two panels, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>
 . To do this, go to <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 in the Xcode menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y. When <span class="code">str</span>
 is printed in the console of the debug area, you can see that the quotes around <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 and the newline character don’t appear. This is what <span class="code">str</span>
 would really look like if you were to officially run this program!</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_20"></span>
 <img src="Image00039.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig4"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-4: Viewing the real output of your program in the debug area</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>
 .</p>

<em>In the playground, an error will appear as a red circle with a tiny white circle inside it. Clicking the error mark will show the error message and tell you what’s wrong.

</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 . What a zoo!</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec1">
<strong>CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here’s the line of code from <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 again:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00037.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">It does two things. First, it creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . This is called a <em>declaration</em>
 because we are declaring that we would like to create a variable. To create a variable, you type the word <span class="code">var</span>
 and then type a name for your variable—this case, <span class="code">str</span>
 . There are some rules when naming variables, which we’ll go over later, so for now stick with this example.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, this line of code gives a value of <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 to <span class="code">str</span>
 using the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator. This is called an <em>assignment</em>
 because we are assigning a value to our newly created variable. Remember, you can think of a variable as a container that holds something. So now we have a container named <span class="code">str</span>
 that holds <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can read this line of code as “the variable <span class="code">str</span>
 equals <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 .” As you can see, Swift is often very readable; this line of code practically tells you in English what it’s doing.</p>
<p class="indent">Variables are handy because if you want to print the words “Hello, playground” all you have to do is use the command <span class="code">print</span>
 on <span class="code">str</span>
 , like in the following code:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00038.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This prints <span class="code">"Hello, playground\n"</span>
 in the results sidebar. The <span class="code">\n</span>
 is added automatically to the end of whatever you print. It is known as the <em>newline</em>
 character and tells the computer to go to a new line.</p>
<p class="indent">To see the results of your program as it would actually run, bring up the debug area, which will appear below the two panels, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>
 . To do this, go to <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 in the Xcode menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y. When <span class="code">str</span>
 is printed in the console of the debug area, you can see that the quotes around <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 and the newline character don’t appear. This is what <span class="code">str</span>
 would really look like if you were to officially run this program!</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_20"></span>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig4"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-4: Viewing the real output of your program in the debug area</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>
 .</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>

<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">Here’s the line of code from <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>
 again:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00037.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">It does two things. First, it creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . This is called a <em>declaration</em>
 because we are declaring that we would like to create a variable. To create a variable, you type the word <span class="code">var</span>
 and then type a name for your variable—this case, <span class="code">str</span>
 . There are some rules when naming variables, which we’ll go over later, so for now stick with this example.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, this line of code gives a value of <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 to <span class="code">str</span>
 using the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator. This is called an <em>assignment</em>
 because we are assigning a value to our newly created variable. Remember, you can think of a variable as a container that holds something. So now we have a container named <span class="code">str</span>
 that holds <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can read this line of code as “the variable <span class="code">str</span>
 equals <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 .” As you can see, Swift is often very readable; this line of code practically tells you in English what it’s doing.</p>
<p class="indent">Variables are handy because if you want to print the words “Hello, playground” all you have to do is use the command <span class="code">print</span>
 on <span class="code">str</span>
 , like in the following code:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00038.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This prints <span class="code">"Hello, playground\n"</span>
 in the results sidebar. The <span class="code">\n</span>
 is added automatically to the end of whatever you print. It is known as the <em>newline</em>
 character and tells the computer to go to a new line.</p>
<p class="indent">To see the results of your program as it would actually run, bring up the debug area, which will appear below the two panels, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>
 . To do this, go to <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 in the Xcode menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y. When <span class="code">str</span>
 is printed in the console of the debug area, you can see that the quotes around <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 and the newline character don’t appear. This is what <span class="code">str</span>
 would really look like if you were to officially run this program!</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_20"></span>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig4"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-4: Viewing the real output of your program in the debug area</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00042.jpg" alt="image" />

<em>In the playground, an error will appear as a red circle with a tiny white circle inside it. Clicking the error mark will show the error message and tell you what’s wrong.

</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>

 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>

<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>

 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />

<div class="image"><img src="Image00075.jpg" alt="Image" />

 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00037.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">It does two things. First, it creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . This is called a <em>declaration</em>
 because we are declaring that we would like to create a variable. To create a variable, you type the word <span class="code">var</span>
 and then type a name for your variable—this case, <span class="code">str</span>
 . There are some rules when naming variables, which we’ll go over later, so for now stick with this example.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, this line of code gives a value of <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 to <span class="code">str</span>
 using the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator. This is called an <em>assignment</em>
 because we are assigning a value to our newly created variable. Remember, you can think of a variable as a container that holds something. So now we have a container named <span class="code">str</span>
 that holds <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can read this line of code as “the variable <span class="code">str</span>
 equals <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 .” As you can see, Swift is often very readable; this line of code practically tells you in English what it’s doing.</p>
<p class="indent">Variables are handy because if you want to print the words “Hello, playground” all you have to do is use the command <span class="code">print</span>
 on <span class="code">str</span>
 , like in the following code:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00038.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This prints <span class="code">"Hello, playground\n"</span>
 in the results sidebar. The <span class="code">\n</span>
 is added automatically to the end of whatever you print. It is known as the <em>newline</em>
 character and tells the computer to go to a new line.</p>
<p class="indent">To see the results of your program as it would actually run, bring up the debug area, which will appear below the two panels, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>
 . To do this, go to <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 in the Xcode menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y. When <span class="code">str</span>
 is printed in the console of the debug area, you can see that the quotes around <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 and the newline character don’t appear. This is what <span class="code">str</span>
 would really look like if you were to officially run this program!</p>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig4"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-4: Viewing the real output of your program in the debug area</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>
 .</p>

</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>

 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">It does two things. First, it creates a variable named <span class="code">str</span>
 . This is called a <em>declaration</em>
 because we are declaring that we would like to create a variable. To create a variable, you type the word <span class="code">var</span>
 and then type a name for your variable—this case, <span class="code">str</span>
 . There are some rules when naming variables, which we’ll go over later, so for now stick with this example.</p>
<p class="indent">Second, this line of code gives a value of <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 to <span class="code">str</span>
 using the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator. This is called an <em>assignment</em>
 because we are assigning a value to our newly created variable. Remember, you can think of a variable as a container that holds something. So now we have a container named <span class="code">str</span>
 that holds <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can read this line of code as “the variable <span class="code">str</span>
 equals <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 .” As you can see, Swift is often very readable; this line of code practically tells you in English what it’s doing.</p>
<p class="indent">Variables are handy because if you want to print the words “Hello, playground” all you have to do is use the command <span class="code">print</span>
 on <span class="code">str</span>
 , like in the following code:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00038.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This prints <span class="code">"Hello, playground\n"</span>
 in the results sidebar. The <span class="code">\n</span>
 is added automatically to the end of whatever you print. It is known as the <em>newline</em>
 character and tells the computer to go to a new line.</p>
<p class="indent">To see the results of your program as it would actually run, bring up the debug area, which will appear below the two panels, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>
 . To do this, go to <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 in the Xcode menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y. When <span class="code">str</span>
 is printed in the console of the debug area, you can see that the quotes around <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 and the newline character don’t appear. This is what <span class="code">str</span>
 would really look like if you were to officially run this program!</p>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig4"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-4: Viewing the real output of your program in the debug area</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>
 .</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Second, this line of code gives a value of <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 to <span class="code">str</span>
 using the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator. This is called an <em>assignment</em>
 because we are assigning a value to our newly created variable. Remember, you can think of a variable as a container that holds something. So now we have a container named <span class="code">str</span>
 that holds <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can read this line of code as “the variable <span class="code">str</span>
 equals <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 .” As you can see, Swift is often very readable; this line of code practically tells you in English what it’s doing.</p>
<p class="indent">Variables are handy because if you want to print the words “Hello, playground” all you have to do is use the command <span class="code">print</span>
 on <span class="code">str</span>
 , like in the following code:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00038.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This prints <span class="code">"Hello, playground\n"</span>
 in the results sidebar. The <span class="code">\n</span>
 is added automatically to the end of whatever you print. It is known as the <em>newline</em>
 character and tells the computer to go to a new line.</p>
<p class="indent">To see the results of your program as it would actually run, bring up the debug area, which will appear below the two panels, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>
 . To do this, go to <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 in the Xcode menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y. When <span class="code">str</span>
 is printed in the console of the debug area, you can see that the quotes around <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 and the newline character don’t appear. This is what <span class="code">str</span>
 would really look like if you were to officially run this program!</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_20"></span>
 <img src="Image00039.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig4"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-4: Viewing the real output of your program in the debug area</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00042.jpg" alt="image" />

</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">You can read this line of code as “the variable <span class="code">str</span>
 equals <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 .” As you can see, Swift is often very readable; this line of code practically tells you in English what it’s doing.</p>
<p class="indent">Variables are handy because if you want to print the words “Hello, playground” all you have to do is use the command <span class="code">print</span>
 on <span class="code">str</span>
 , like in the following code:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00038.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This prints <span class="code">"Hello, playground\n"</span>
 in the results sidebar. The <span class="code">\n</span>
 is added automatically to the end of whatever you print. It is known as the <em>newline</em>
 character and tells the computer to go to a new line.</p>
<p class="indent">To see the results of your program as it would actually run, bring up the debug area, which will appear below the two panels, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>
 . To do this, go to <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 in the Xcode menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y. When <span class="code">str</span>
 is printed in the console of the debug area, you can see that the quotes around <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 and the newline character don’t appear. This is what <span class="code">str</span>
 would really look like if you were to officially run this program!</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_20"></span>
 <img src="Image00039.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig4"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-4: Viewing the real output of your program in the debug area</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>

<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Variables are handy because if you want to print the words “Hello, playground” all you have to do is use the command <span class="code">print</span>
 on <span class="code">str</span>
 , like in the following code:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00038.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This prints <span class="code">"Hello, playground\n"</span>
 in the results sidebar. The <span class="code">\n</span>
 is added automatically to the end of whatever you print. It is known as the <em>newline</em>
 character and tells the computer to go to a new line.</p>
<p class="indent">To see the results of your program as it would actually run, bring up the debug area, which will appear below the two panels, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>
 . To do this, go to <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 in the Xcode menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y. When <span class="code">str</span>
 is printed in the console of the debug area, you can see that the quotes around <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 and the newline character don’t appear. This is what <span class="code">str</span>
 would really look like if you were to officially run this program!</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_20"></span>
 <img src="Image00039.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig4"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-4: Viewing the real output of your program in the debug area</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>
 .</p>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00038.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This prints <span class="code">"Hello, playground\n"</span>
 in the results sidebar. The <span class="code">\n</span>
 is added automatically to the end of whatever you print. It is known as the <em>newline</em>
 character and tells the computer to go to a new line.</p>
<p class="indent">To see the results of your program as it would actually run, bring up the debug area, which will appear below the two panels, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>
 . To do this, go to <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 in the Xcode menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y. When <span class="code">str</span>
 is printed in the console of the debug area, you can see that the quotes around <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 and the newline character don’t appear. This is what <span class="code">str</span>
 would really look like if you were to officially run this program!</p>

<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig4"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-4: Viewing the real output of your program in the debug area</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>

</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>

 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>

<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">This prints <span class="code">"Hello, playground\n"</span>
 in the results sidebar. The <span class="code">\n</span>
 is added automatically to the end of whatever you print. It is known as the <em>newline</em>
 character and tells the computer to go to a new line.</p>
<p class="indent">To see the results of your program as it would actually run, bring up the debug area, which will appear below the two panels, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>
 . To do this, go to <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 in the Xcode menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y. When <span class="code">str</span>
 is printed in the console of the debug area, you can see that the quotes around <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 and the newline character don’t appear. This is what <span class="code">str</span>
 would really look like if you were to officially run this program!</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_20"></span>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig4"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-4: Viewing the real output of your program in the debug area</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>
 .</p>

<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />

<div class="image"><img src="Image00075.jpg" alt="Image" />

<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">To see the results of your program as it would actually run, bring up the debug area, which will appear below the two panels, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig4">Figure 2-4</a>
 . To do this, go to <strong>View</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Debug Area</strong>
 <span class="ent">▸</span>
 <strong>Show Debug Area</strong>
 in the Xcode menu or press <span class="ent">⌘</span>
 -<span class="smallcaps">SHIFT</span>
 -Y. When <span class="code">str</span>
 is printed in the console of the debug area, you can see that the quotes around <span class="code">Hello, playground</span>
 and the newline character don’t appear. This is what <span class="code">str</span>
 would really look like if you were to officially run this program!</p>
<div class="image"><span id="page_20"></span>

</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig4"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-4: Viewing the real output of your program in the debug area</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>
 .</p>

</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig4"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-4: Viewing the real output of your program in the debug area</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>
 .</p>

<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>

<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>

<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

 <em>Figure 2-4: Viewing the real output of your program in the debug area</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00042.jpg" alt="image" />

<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />

 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Variables can change (or <em>vary</em>
 !) in your programs, so you can change the value of a variable to hold something else. Let’s try that now. Add the following lines to your playground.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00042.jpg" alt="image" />

<em>In the playground, an error will appear as a red circle with a tiny white circle inside it. Clicking the error mark will show the error message and tell you what’s wrong. If you have your debug area showing, you should also see information describing what happened and sometimes even how to fix it.</em>
</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00040.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>
 .</p>

<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>

<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">To change the value of a variable, type its name and use the <span class="code">=</span>
 operator to set it to a new value. We do this at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 to change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 to <span class="code">"Hello, world"</span>
 . The computer throws away whatever <span class="code">str</span>
 used to hold, and says, “Okay, boss, <span class="code">str</span>
 is now <span class="code">Hello, world</span>
 ” (that is, it would say that if it could talk!).</p>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>
 .</p>

<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />

<div class="image"><img src="Image00075.jpg" alt="Image" />

 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Notice that when we change the value of <span class="code">str</span>
 , we don’t write <span class="code">var</span>
 again. The computer remembers that we declared <span class="code">str</span>
 in a previous line of code and knows that <span class="code">str</span>
 already exists. So we don’t need to create <span class="code">str</span>
 again. We just want to put something different in it.</p>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>
 .</p>

</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">You can also declare <em>constants.</em>
 Like variables, constants hold values. The big difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant can never change its value. Variables can vary, and constants are, well, constant! Declaring a constant is similar to declaring a variable, but we use the word <span class="code">let</span>
 instead of <span class="code">var</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00041.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00042.jpg" alt="image" />

<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>

<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>

 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>

<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>

<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>

<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Here we create a constant called <span class="code">myName</span>
 and assign it the value of <span class="code">"Gloria"</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Once you create a constant and give it a value, it will have that value until the end of time. Think of a constant as a big rock into which you’ve carved your value. If you try to give <span class="code">myName</span>
 another value, like <span class="code">"Matt"</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig5">Figure 2-5</a>

</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>

<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />

<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>

 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>

<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec1">
<strong>WHEN TO USE CONSTANTS VS. VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>

</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>

 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>

<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">Now you’ve successfully created a variable and a constant—good job! But when should you use one over the other? In Swift, it’s best practice to use constants instead of variables unless you expect the value will change. Constants help make code “safer.” If you know the value of something is never going to change, why not etch it into stone and avoid any possible confusion later?</p>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">For example, say you want to keep track of the total number of windows in your classroom and the number of windows that are open today. The number of windows in your classroom isn’t going to change, so you should use a constant to store this value. The number of windows that are open in your classroom will change depending on the weather and time of day, however, so you should use a variable to store this value.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />

 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00044.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>

<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00045.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>

<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">We make <span class="code">numberOfWindows</span>
 a constant and set it to <span class="code">8</span>
 because the total number of windows will always be 8. We make <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 a variable and set it to <span class="code">3</span>
 because we’ll want to change that value when we open or close windows.</p>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>

 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>

 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />

<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Remember: use <span class="code">var</span>
 for variables and <span class="code">let</span>
 for constants!</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec2"><span id="page_22"></span>
 <strong>NAMING CONSTANTS AND VARIABLES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>

</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />

<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">You can name a variable or constant almost anything you want, with a few exceptions. You can’t name them something that is already a word in Swift. For example, you can’t name a variable <span class="code">var</span>
 . Writing <span class="code">var var</span>
 would just be confusing, to you and the computer. You’ll get an error if you try to name a variable or constant using one of Swift’s reserved words. You also can’t have two variables or constants with the same name in the same block of code.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />

<div class="image"><img src="Image00075.jpg" alt="Image" />

<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">In addition to these rules, there are some other good programming guidelines to follow when naming things in Swift. Your names should always start with a lowercase letter. It’s also a good idea to have <em>very</em>
 descriptive names (they can be as long as you want). When you use a descriptive name, it’s a lot easier to figure out what that variable or constant is supposed to be. If you were looking at someone else’s code, which variable name would you find easier to understand: <span class="code">numKids</span>
 or <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 ? The first one is vague, but the second one is descriptive. It’s common to see variables and constants that are a bunch of words strung together, like <span class="code">numberOfKidsInMyClass</span>
 . This capitalization style, where the first letter of each word is capitalized when multiple words are joined together to make a variable name, is called <em>camel case</em>
 . That’s because the pattern of lowercase and uppercase letters looks like the humps on a camel’s back.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00046.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 . What a zoo!</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec2">
<strong>DATA TYPES</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">In Swift, you can choose what kind of data—the <em>data type</em>
 —you want a variable or constant to hold. Remember how we said you can think of a variable as a container that holds something? Well, the data type is like the container type. The computer needs to know what kind of things we’ll put in each container. In Swift programming, once you tell the computer you want a variable or constant to hold a certain data type, it won’t let you put anything but that data type in that variable or constant. If you have a basket designed to hold potatoes, it’d be a bad idea to fill that basket with water—unless you like water leaking all over your shoes!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00047.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>

<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>

 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>

</html>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec3"><span id="page_23"></span>
 <strong>DECLARING DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00075.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">When you create a variable or a constant, you can tell the computer what type of data it will hold. In our example about classroom windows, we know this variable will always be an <em>integer</em>
 (that is, a whole number—you can’t really have half a window), so we could specify an integer data type, like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00048.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">The colon means “is of type.” In plain English, this line of code says, “the variable <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , which is an integer, is equal to 3.” So this line of code creates a variable, gives it a name, tells the computer its data type, and assigns it a value. Phew! One line of code did all that? Did we mention that Swift is a very <em>concise</em>
 language? Some languages might require several lines of code to do this same thing. Swift is designed so that you can do a bunch of things with just one line of code!</p>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />

<div class="image"><img src="Image00075.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">You only have to declare the data type once. When we tell the computer that a variable will hold integers, we don’t have to tell it again. In fact, if we do, Xcode will give us an error. Once the data type is declared, a variable or constant will hold that type of data forever. Once an integer, always an integer!</p>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />

<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">There’s one more thing you need to know about data types: a variable or constant can’t hold something that isn’t its data type. For example, if you try to put a decimal number into <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen</span>
 , you’ll get an error, as shown in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig6">Figure 2-6</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00049.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig6"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-6: You can’t put a decimal number into a variable that is supposed to hold an integer.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />

<div class="image"><img src="Image00075.jpg" alt="Image" />

<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />

<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />

<div class="image"><img src="Image00075.jpg" alt="Image" />

<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Setting <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 5</span>
 and <span class="code">numberOfWindowsOpen = 0</span>
 is valid and works. But you can’t <span class="code">set numberOfWindowsOpen = 1.5</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />

<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec4"><span id="page_24"></span>
 <strong>COMMON DATA TYPES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">As you just learned, a data type lets the computer know what <em>kind</em>
 of data it is working with and how to store it in its memory. But what are the data types? Some common ones include <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , <span class="code">Bool</span>
 , and <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Let’s dig in and see what each one of these actually is!</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec1">
<strong>Int (Integers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">We already talked a little bit about integers, but let’s go over them in more detail. An integer, called an <span class="code">Int</span>
 in Swift, is a whole number that has no decimal or fractional part. You can think of them as counting numbers. Integers are <em>signed</em>
 , meaning that they can be negative or positive (or zero).</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>

 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec2">
<strong>Double and Float (Decimal Numbers)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Decimal numbers</em>
 are numbers that have digits after the decimal point, like 3.14. (An integer like 3 would be written as 3.0 if you wanted it to be a decimal number.) There are two data types that can store decimal numbers: a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and a <span class="code">Float</span>
 (short for <em>floating-point number</em>
 ). The <span class="code">Double</span>
 data type is more common in Swift because it can hold bigger numbers, so we’ll focus on those.</p>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />

<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">When you assign a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you must always have a digit to the left of the decimal place or you will get an error. For example, suppose bananas cost 19 cents each:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>

<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

</body>
</html>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00050.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">The code at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 will result in an error because it doesn’t have a digit to the left of the decimal point. The code at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 works fine because it has a leading zero. (The phrases <span class="code">// ERROR</span>
 and <span class="code">// CORRECT</span>
 are <em>comments</em>
 , which are notes in a program that are ignored by the computer. See “<a href="text00012.html#ch02sb01">A Few Quick Comments About Comments</a>
 ” on <a href="text00012.html#page_32">page 32</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec3">
<strong>Bool (Booleans, or True/False)</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<p class="noindent">A <em>Boolean value</em>
 can only be one of two things: true or false. In Swift, the Boolean data type is called a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00051.jpg" alt="Image" />

<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>

<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>

 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />

<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>
</div>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Booleans are often used in <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements to tell the computer which path a program should take. (We’ll cover Booleans and <span class="code">if-else</span>
 statements in more detail in <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 .)</p>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<h5 class="h5" id="ch02lev3sec4">
<strong>String</strong>
</h5>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>

 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>

 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="code">String</span>
 data type is used to store words and phrases. A <em>string</em>
 is a collection of characters enclosed in quotation marks. For example, <span class="code">"Hello, playground"</span>
 is a string. Strings can be made up of all sorts of <span id="page_25"></span>
 characters: letters, numbers, symbols, and more. The quotation marks are important because they tell the computer that everything in between the quotes is part of a string that you’re creating.</p>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">You can use strings to build sentences by adding strings together in a process called string <em>concatenation</em>
 . Let’s see how it works!</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>

<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00052.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>

 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">By adding strings together with the plus sign (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), this code creates a variable called <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 with the string <span class="code">"Good Morning Jude"</span>
 as its value. Note that we need to add a string containing a space character (<span class="code">" "</span>
 ) between <span class="code">morningGreeting</span>
 and <span class="code">friend</span>
 here or else <span class="code">specialGreeting</span>
 would be <span class="code">"Good MorningJude"</span>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00053.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec5">
<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>

<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>

<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

<strong>TYPE INFERENCE</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>

<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>

<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience.

<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>

<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />

 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">You may have noticed that sometimes when we declare a variable, we include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>

 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>

 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00075.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00054.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>

<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">And sometimes we do not include the data type:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00055.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">What gives? The computer is actually smart enough to figure out the data type, most of the time. This is called <em>type inference</em>
 —because the computer will <em>infer</em>
 , or guess, the type of data we are using based on clues that we give it. When you create a variable and give it an initial value, that value is a big clue for the computer. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />

 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />

 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with no decimal value (like 3), the computer will assume it’s an <span class="code">Int</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>

 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>

 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />

 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="bull">• If you assign a number with a decimal value (like 3.14), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>

<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="bull">• If you assign the word <em>true</em>
 or <em>false</em>
 (with no quotes around it), the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">Bool</span>
 .</p>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="bull">• If you assign one or more characters with quotes around them, the computer will assume it’s a <span class="code">String</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_26"></span>
 When the type is inferred, the variable or constant is set to that data type just as if you had declared the data type yourself. This is done purely for convenience. You can include the data type every time you declare a new constant or variable, and that’s perfectly fine. But why not let the computer figure it out and save yourself the time and extra typing?</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>

 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec6">
<strong>TRANSFORMING DATA TYPES WITH CASTING</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>

 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />

 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
<em>Casting</em>
 is a way to temporarily transform the data type of a variable or constant. You can think of this as casting a spell on a variable—you make its value behave like a different data type, but just for a short while. To do this, you write a new data type followed by parentheses that hold the variable you are casting. Note that this <em>doesn’t actually change the data type</em>
 . It just gives you a temporary value for that one line of code. Here are a few examples of casting between <span class="code">Int</span>
 and <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Take a look at the results of your code in the results sidebar.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>

 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00056.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00057.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>

 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>

 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>

 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />

 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Int</span>
 variable <span class="code">months</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 and store it in a new variable called <span class="code">doubleMonths</span>
 . This adds a decimal place, and the result of this casting is <span class="code">12.0</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>

 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>

 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>

 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">You can also cast a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>

Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00058.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">days</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . You can see that the decimal place and all the digits following it were removed: our number became <span class="code">365</span>
 . This is because an <span class="code">Int</span>
 is not capable of holding a decimal number—it can contain only whole numbers, so anything after the decimal point is chopped off.</p>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />

 is <span class="code">8</span>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />

{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00075.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Again, casting doesn’t actually change a data type. In our example, even after casting, <span class="code">days</span>
 is <em>still</em>
 a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . We can verify this by printing <span class="code">days</span>
 :</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00059.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

<p class="indent">The results sidebar shows that <span class="code">days</span>
 is still equal to <span class="code">365.25</span>

<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">In the next section, we’ll cover some examples of where and when you would use casting. So if it’s not clear right now why you would cast a variable, just hold on a bit longer!</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec3"><span id="page_27"></span>
 <strong>OPERATORS</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a number of arithmetic operators in Swift that you can use to do math. You have already seen the basic assignment operator, <span class="code">=</span>
 . You’re probably also familiar with addition (<span class="code">+</span>
 ), subtraction (<span class="code">-</span>
 ), multiplication (<span class="code">*</span>
 ), and division (<span class="code">/</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>

 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />

<div class="image"><img src="Image00075.jpg" alt="Image" />

<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to perform math on the <span class="code">Int</span>
 , <span class="code">Float</span>
 , and <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types. The numbers being operated on are called <em>operands</em>
 . Experiment with these math operators in your playground by entering code like the following:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00060.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">If you enter this code in your playground, you’ll see the results of each math expression in the sidebar. Writing math expressions in code is not that different from writing them normally. For example, 16 minus 2 is written as <span class="code">16 – 2</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>

 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>

 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>

 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>

 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">You can even save the result of a math expression in a variable or constant so you can use it somewhere else in your code. To see how this works, enter these lines in your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00061.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing.

It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>

<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

<p class="indent">When you print <span class="code">sum</span>
 <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , you’ll see <span class="code">7.6</span>
 in the sidebar.</p>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00074.jpg" alt="image" />

<div class="image"><img src="Image00075.jpg" alt="Image" />

<p class="indent">After two giraffes, two elephants, and four antelope board the ark, the final value for <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 is <span class="code">8</span>
 . What a zoo!</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>

 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>

 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>

 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">So far, we’ve used only numbers in our math expressions, but math operators also work on variables and constants.</p>
<p class="indent">Add the following code to your playground:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>

 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>

 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00062.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>

<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">As you can see, you can use math operators on variables and constants like you did on numbers.</p>
<div class="box1">
<p class="box-title"><span id="page_28"></span>
 <strong>SPACES MATTER</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">In Swift, the spaces around an operator are important. You can either write a blank space on both sides of the math operator or leave out the spaces altogether. But you cannot just put a space on one side of the operator and not the other. That will cause an error. Take a look at <a style=";color:black;" href="text00012.html#ch02fig7">Figure 2-7</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00063.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig7" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-7: Make sure that you have the same number of spaces on each side of your operators.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>
 shows math expressions using compound assignment operators and the same expressions in their longer forms.</p>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

<p class="box-title"><a id="ch02sb01" style=";color:black;"></a>
 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>

 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>

<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>

 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />

<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>

<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>

<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>

 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="box-pi">There is one important thing to note: you can only use a math operator on variables or constants that are the <em>same</em>
 data type. In the previous code, <span class="code">three</span>
 and <span class="code">five</span>
 are both <span class="code">Int</span>
 data types. The constants <span class="code">half</span>
 and <span class="code">quarter</span>
 are <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types because they are decimal numbers. If you try to add or multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 and a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , you’ll get an error like the one in <a href="text00012.html#ch02fig8">Figure 2-8</a>
 .</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00064.jpg" alt="image" />
</div>

 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>

</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

<p class="figcap"><a id="ch02fig8"></a>
 <em>Figure 2-8: In Swift, you cannot do math on mixed data types.</em>
</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_29"></span>
 But what if you really want to do math on mixed data types? For example, let’s say you want to calculate one-tenth of your age:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 before multiplying it. This means we no longer have mixed types, so the code works. But at <span class="ent">➋</span>
 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>

</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>

 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>

 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">

  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>

</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00065.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">The last line will result in an error because we’re attempting to multiply an <span class="code">Int</span>
 by a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . But don’t worry! You have a couple of options to make sure your operands are the same data type.</p>
<p class="indent">One option is to declare <span class="code">myAge</span>
 as a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , like this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00066.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>
 data types.</p>
<p class="indent">The second option is to use casting. (I told you we would come back to this!) Casting is a great solution in this case because we don’t want to permanently change <span class="code">myAge</span>
 to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 , we just want to be able to perform math with it as if it were a <span class="code">Double</span>
 . Let’s take a look at an example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00067.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , we cast <span class="code">myAge</span>

 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>
 did not permanently change it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>

 gives us <span class="code">0</span>

 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>

 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>

<p class="indent">This code works because we’re multiplying two <span class="code">Double</span>

 we will get an error. That’s because <span class="code">myAge</span>
 is still an <span class="code">Int</span>
 . Casting it to a <span class="code">Double</span>
 at <span class="ent">➊</span>

<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>

 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>

</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>

<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>

 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">Could we cast <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 ? You bet! Then we are doing math on two integers, which works fine. However, this results in a less precise calculation because we’ll lose the decimal place. When you cast a variable from a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , the computer simply removes any digits after the decimal to make it a whole number. In this case, your <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 of <span class="code">0.1</span>
 would cast to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 of <span class="code">0</span>
 . Let’s cast some variables in the playground and see what we get:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00068.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch02lev1sec4">
<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , casting our <span class="code">Double</span>
 , <span class="code">multiplier</span>
 , to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 gives us <span class="code">0</span>
 . This value is quite different after casting, because we lost the decimal place: <span class="code">0.1</span>
 became <span class="code">0</span>
 . This could be a very bad thing in our code if we were not expecting it to happen. You must be careful when casting to make sure you aren’t unexpectedly changing your values. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , there’s another example of casting a <span class="code">Double</span>
 to an <span class="code">Int</span>
 , and as you can see, <span class="code">1.9</span>
 does not get rounded up to <span class="code">2</span>
 . Its decimal value just gets removed and we are left with <span class="code">1</span>
 .</p>
<p class="indent"><span id="page_30"></span>
 There’s another math operator, the <em>modulo operator</em>
 (<span class="code">%</span>
 ), which might not be as familiar to you. The modulo operator (also called <em>modulus</em>
 ) gives the remainder after division. For example, <span class="code">7 % 2 = 1</span>
 because 7 divided by 2 has a remainder of 1. Try out the modulo operator in your playground, as follows.</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00069.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">As you can see, the modulo operator is useful for determining whether a number is even (<span class="code">evenNumber % 2</span>
 equals 0) <span class="ent">➊</span>
 or odd (<span class="code">oddNumber % 2</span>
 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>

 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>

 equals 1) <span class="ent">➋</span>

<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec7">
<strong>ORDER OF OPERATIONS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />

{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="noindent">So far we’ve only done one math operation on each line of code, but it’s common to do more than one operation on a single line. Let’s look at an example.</p>
<p class="indent">How much money do you have if you have three five-dollar bills and two one-dollar bills? Let’s calculate this on one line:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00070.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">This assigns a value of <span class="code">17</span>
 to <span class="code">myMoney</span>
 . The computer multiplies 5 times 3 and then adds 2. But how does the computer know to multiply first and <em>then</em>
 add 2? Does it just work from left to right? No! Take a look at this:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00071.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">We moved the numbers around and the result is still 17. If the computer just went from left to right, it would add 2 + 5 and get 7. Then it would multiply that result, 7, times 3, and get 21. Even though we changed the order of the numbers in our math expression, the computer still multiplies first (which gives us 15) and then adds the 2 to get 17. <em>The computer will always do multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.</em>
 This is called the <em>order of operations</em>
 .</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec8">
<strong>ORDERING OPERATIONS WITH PARENTHESES</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">You don’t have to rely on the computer to figure out which step to do first like we did in the money example. You, the programmer, have the power to <span id="page_31"></span>
 decide! You can use parentheses to group operations together. When you put parentheses around something, you tell the computer to do that step first:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00072.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">
<strong>COMPOUND ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS</strong>
</h4>
<p class="noindent">Another category of operators that you’ll use is the <em>compound assignment operators</em>
 . These are “shortcut” operators that combine a math operator with the assignment operator (<span class="code">=</span>
 ). For example, this expression</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a = a + b</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindent">becomes</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>a + = b</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">You can use these operators to update the value of a variable or constant by performing an operation on it. In plain English, an expression like <span class="code">a += b</span>
 says “add <span class="code">b</span>
 to <span class="code">a</span>
 and store the new value in <span class="code">a</span>
 .” <a href="text00012.html#ch2tab1">Table 2-1</a>

<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>
</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>
</p>
</body>
</html>
<p class="indent">At <span class="ent">➊</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to multiply 5 times 3 first and then add 2. This will give you 17. At <span class="ent">➋</span>
 , the parentheses tell the computer to add 2 plus 5 first and then multiply that by 3, which gives you 21.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make your code even more specific by using parentheses inside of other parentheses. The computer will evaluate the inside parentheses first and then the outside ones. Try this example:</p>
<div class="image"><img src="Image00073.jpg" alt="Image" />
</div>
<p class="indent">First the computer adds 2 and 3 between the inner parentheses. Then it multiplies the result by 4, since that’s within the outer set of parentheses. It will add the 1 last because it’s outside both sets of parentheses. The final result is 21.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="ch02lev2sec9">

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>

Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code.

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />

{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

 <strong>A FEW QUICK COMMENTS ABOUT COMMENTS</strong>
</p>
<p class="box-p">Most programming languages come with a way to write comments inline with the code. Comments are notes that are ignored by the computer and are there to help the humans reading the code understand what’s going on. Although a program will run fine without any comments, it’s a good idea to include them for sections of code that might be unclear or confusing. Even if you’re not going to show your program to anybody else, your comments will help you remember what you were doing or thinking when you wrote that code. It’s not uncommon to come back to a piece of code you wrote months or years ago and have no idea what you were thinking at the time.</p>
<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<p class="indenti">There are two ways to add comments in Swift. The first way is to put two forward slashes (<span class="code">//</span>
 ) in front of the text you want to add. These comments can be placed on their own line, like this:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>// My favorite things</pre>
</div>
<p class="noindenti"><span id="page_33"></span>
 Or they can be placed on the same line as a line of code—as long as the comment comes <em>after</em>
 the code:</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>var myFavoriteAnimal = "Horse" // Does not have to be a pet</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">The second way is used for long comments, or <em>multiline</em>
 comments, where the start and end of the comment is marked by <span class="code">/*</span>
 and <span class="code">*/</span>
 . (Note that we’ll use <span class="code">--</span>
 <em>snip</em>
 <span class="code">--</span>
 in this book to show where there are more code lines that we’ve omitted for space.)</p>
<div class="box">
<pre>/*<br />
  This block of code will add up the animals<br />
  that walk onto an ark.<br />
*/<br />
{<br />
  var animalsOnArk = 0<br />
  let numberOfGiraffes = 2<br />
  animalsOnArk += numberOfGiraffes<br />
  --<em>snip</em>
 -<br />
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="indent">Multiline comments are useful when you debug your code. For example, if you don’t want the computer to run part of your code because you’re trying to find a bug, but you also don’t want to delete all of your hard work, you can use multiline comments to <em>comment out</em>
 sections of code temporarily. When you format a chunk of code as a comment, the computer will ignore that code just like it ignores any other comment.</p>

<strong>WHAT YOU LEARNED</strong>

<p class="noindent">In this chapter you learned how to write code in a Swift playground, which lets you see results right away. You created variables and constants and learned how to use the basic data types and operators that you will be seeing again and again as you write your own computer programs.</p>
<p class="indent">In <a href="text00013.html#ch03">Chapter 3</a>
 , you will be using conditional statements, which tell the computer which code path you want it to go down. The code path is chosen based on a condition’s value.<span id="page_34"></span>

<p class="indent"><span id="page_32"></span>
 Let’s see the <span class="code">+=</span>
 operator in action. Imagine that we’re trying to write a program to calculate the number of animals on an ark. First we create a variable called <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 and set it to <span class="code">0</span>
 because there aren’t animals on the ark yet. As the different types of animals board the ark, we want to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 to count all of the animals. If two giraffes board the ark, then we need to add 2 to <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 . If two elephants board the ark, then we need to add 2 again. If four antelope board the ark, then we need to increase <span class="code">animalsOnArk</span>
 by 4.</p>

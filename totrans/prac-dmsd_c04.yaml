    conquest (coveting Venus, of all things). In a similarly anachronistic twist,
    a 1909 story by E. M. Forster, titled “The Machine Stops,” delivers a stern warning
    about the dangers of artificial intelligence and advanced technology—with meek
    humans languishing in the tunnels under the surface of their ravaged planet, interacting

    and reach for a fantastic, though goofy-sounding, manual titled *Nuclear War Survival
    Skills*. The book was written in 1979 by Cresson Kearny, a researcher and avid
    survivalist who worked at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee—and rubbed
    shoulders with the forefathers of the US nuclear program. It’s meant as a civil
    defense manual of sorts, with plans for makeshift shelters, radiation meters,
    and water purification techniques, but it’s also a treasure trove of factual information
    about the mechanics of nuclear bombs and their effects on human and animal life.
    The book is still in print and is also available in the public domain: [https://archive.org/details/NuclearWarSurvivalSkills_201405/.](https://archive.org/details/NuclearWarSurvivalSkills_201405/.)'

- en: Perhaps Kearny’s most salient observation is that the atom bomb is not designed
    to spread radiation—and indeed, this happens only to a limited extent. In its
    most common mode of operation, the bomb is detonated high above the target, and
    derives the bulk of its destructive power from the release of a tremendous amount
    of thermal energy, as mentioned before, with a devastating secondary shockwave
    caused by the expanding gas. The burst of radiant heat can instantly cause lethal
    burns and set wooden structures on fire, while the shockwave flattens buildings
    and uproots trees. This mechanism explains why people who stood in the shadow
    of a sturdy wall or kneeled in a ditch managed to survive the bombings of Hiroshima
    and Nagasaki, even as others nearby perished in the blast. The phenomenon also
    underscores why the “duck and cover” mantra popularized in the 1950s was a pretty
    solid survival tip—even if the government could never convince anyone.

    many survivors, it’s a manageable and short-lived threat. Although people can
    instantly receive a lethal dose of radiation within a fairly small zone at the
    epicenter of a blast, this region is nested deeply within the fiery inferno unleashed
    by the bomb. A more widespread but more latent threat are the byproducts of the
    nuclear reaction that are dispersed in the air and slowly settle on the ground
    over the course of many hours or days—perhaps over the area of the blast, or perhaps
    tens of miles away. The intense radioactivity of the fallout is a major problem,
    but also a blessing of sorts: the high rate of decay means that the radiation
    decreases a hundred-fold within two days, and that it becomes somewhat safe to
    venture outdoors within a couple of weeks. The survivors would eventually face
    an elevated rate of cancers and other ailments, but with basic precautions could
    start rebuilding before too long.'

    explosion is set off at a very high altitude, the resulting gamma radiation knocks
    out electrons from the upper atmosphere, forming a layer of charged plasma and
    sending a flurry of electrons hurling toward the ground at relativistic speeds.
    This charge separation produces a surprisingly high voltage gradient across hundreds
    or thousands of miles of land in the shadow of the blast, potentially disrupting
    electronics, communications, and the power grid in a manner broadly similar to
    the CME phenomenon discussed earlier in the chapter.

    as the *nuclear electromagnetic pulse*, or EMP). Few tests appear to have been
    conducted by the government, and much of the data remains classified. What is
    known for certain is that the initial pulse is far more sudden than in the case
    of solar storms, possibly rendering traditional surge protectors and other automatic
    safety equipment less effective. Beyond that, perhaps the most compelling analysis
    comes from a governmental commission formed to study the threat in the mid-2000s.
    The committee didn’t paint a particularly bleak picture, but also didn’t discount
    the threat, noting that “it is not possible to precisely predict the time to restore
    even minimal electrical service due to an EMP eventuality given the number of
    unknowns and the vast size and complexity of the system with its consequent fragility
    and resiliency.”^([19](b02.xhtml#c04-endnote-19)) In other words, we don’t know

    automobiles that were not turned on during EMP exposure. The most serious effect
    observed on running automobiles was that the motors in three cars stopped at field
    strengths of approximately 30 kV/m or above. In an actual EMP exposure, these
    vehicles would glide to a stop and require the driver to restart them. Electronics
    in the dashboard of one automobile were damaged and required repair. Other effects
    were relatively minor. Twenty-five automobiles exhibited malfunctions that could
    be considered only a nuisance (e.g., blinking dashboard lights) and did not require
    driver intervention to correct. Eight of the 37 cars tested did not exhibit any
    anomalous response.^([20](b02.xhtml#c04-endnote-20))

    the geopolitical ramifications of a strike. Deploying an EMP weapon against a
    nuclear-capable country would almost certainly invite swift and devastating retaliation,
    putting “conventional” nuclear payloads on the table for the first time after
    1945\. From that perspective, it’s probably not a particularly tempting tool for
    a surprise attack by a rogue state—not unless hundreds of intercontinental ballistic
    missiles (ICBMs) aimed at ground targets are flying right behind. And in that
    particular case, an EMP would not be the most pronounced concern.

    much in common with coronal mass ejections, not to mention with power outages

    measures, ranging from backup power to emergency food supplies, can go a long

    the field slid into a prolonged “AI winter” of broken promises and constant disappointments.
    Funding dwindled, and few academics would take pride in associating themselves
    with the discipline. It wasn’t until the late 2000s that AI research made a comeback,
    aided with vastly superior computing resources and significant refinements to
    the architecture of neural networks and to deep learning algorithms. But the field
    focused on humble, utilitarian goals: building systems custom-tailored to perform
    highly specialized tasks, such as voice recognition, image classification, or
    the translation of text. Such architectures, although quite successful, still
    require quite a few quantum leaps to get anywhere close to AGI, and tellingly,

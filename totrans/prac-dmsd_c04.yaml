    about ecosystem collapse are rooted in reasonable science and solid historical
    precedent. For example, massive volcanic activity has been implicated in the Permian
    extinction event that wiped out 70 percent of vertebrate life about 250 million
    years ago,^([12](b02.xhtml#c04-endnote-12)) and one of the still-active supervolcanoes—the
    Yellowstone Caldera—is believed to be capable of covering much of the United States
    in 10 feet of ash.^([13](b02.xhtml#c04-endnote-13)) Similarly, the impact of a
    large asteroid or comet is widely believed to have been the culprit of the Cretaceous–Paleogene
    extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs,^([14](b02.xhtml#c04-endnote-14)) and
    the pockmarked face of our own moon is a reminder that such cosmic events happen
    in our neighborhood with some regularity.

    all available evidence suggests that the cadence of extinction-type events is
    extremely long: a disaster that has a 50 percent probability of occurring in the
    next million years carries less than a 0.01 percent chance of striking within
    the lifetime of any person born today. In that sense, although a supervolcano
    or a cosmic collision may be some of the most profound existential threats to
    reckon with, they’re also relatively distant concerns—and they escape most attempts
    to meaningfully model or mitigate the impact they may eventually have.'

    explosion known as the Tunguska event, widely believed to be the result of a large
    meteorite blowing up in the atmosphere, flattened a remote portion of the Siberian
    taiga in a radius of about 20 miles. But such events, however frightening, don’t

    growth worries of Ehrlich (see Chapter 1), as well as the “peak oil” hypothesis
    formulated by M. King Hubbert in 1956—incorrectly predicting an irreversible decline
    in global oil production capacity starting somewhere in the 1970s, and interpreted

    (*V for Vendetta*, *The Hunger Games*, *The Handmaid’s Tale*), with the authors
    borrowing liberally from the imagery, rhetoric, and mannerisms of Nazi Germany.
    The other category is perhaps more provocative and more varied, imagining citizens

    survivalist who worked at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee—and rubbed
    shoulders with the forefathers of the US nuclear program. It’s meant as a civil
    defense manual of sorts, with plans for makeshift shelters, radiation meters,

    to spread radiation—and indeed, this happens only to a limited extent. In its
    most common mode of operation, the bomb is detonated high above the target, and
    derives the bulk of its destructive power from the release of a tremendous amount
    of thermal energy, as mentioned before, with a devastating secondary shockwave
    caused by the expanding gas. The burst of radiant heat can instantly cause lethal
    burns and set wooden structures on fire, while the shockwave flattens buildings
    and uproots trees. This mechanism explains why people who stood in the shadow
    of a sturdy wall or kneeled in a ditch managed to survive the bombings of Hiroshima
    and Nagasaki, even as others nearby perished in the blast. The phenomenon also
    underscores why the “duck and cover” mantra popularized in the 1950s was a pretty

    by the bomb. A more widespread but more latent threat are the byproducts of the
    nuclear reaction that are dispersed in the air and slowly settle on the ground
    over the course of many hours or days—perhaps over the area of the blast, or perhaps
    tens of miles away. The intense radioactivity of the fallout is a major problem,
    but also a blessing of sorts: the high rate of decay means that the radiation
    decreases a hundred-fold within two days, and that it becomes somewhat safe to
    venture outdoors within a couple of weeks. The survivors would eventually face

    This charge separation produces a surprisingly high voltage gradient across hundreds

    is at minimum an unimaginatively reductionist take. A more fascinating threat
    is that of a machine that doesn’t perceive humans as adversaries, but simply misinterprets
    or disregards our desires and goals. An example is the well-known parable of the
    paperclip maximizer: a hypothetical autonomous AI designed to continually improve
    the efficiency of a paperclip production line. The AI expands and improves the
    operation, developing new assembly methods and new resource extraction and recycling
    procedures, until it’s done converting the entire planet and its many inhabitants
    into paperclips. The point of the tale is simple: the AI doesn’t need to hate
    you or love you; it suffices that you’re made of atoms it has a different use
    for.'

    complete “brain in a jar,” if you will—would be the point of singularity, a moment
    in the development of our species where the change is so monumental and so sudden
    that we can’t meaningfully reason about what lies beyond. The extinction of our
    species is one distinct possibility, but we can imagine many other, more optimistic
    outcomes—and have no way to truly measure the risk.

    is how far we are from developing this kind of AGI. On this topic, the history
    of AI research offers a cautionary tale: after the initial exuberance and some
    stunning early successes of artificial neural networks in the 1950s and 1960s,
    the field slid into a prolonged “AI winter” of broken promises and constant disappointments.
    Funding dwindled, and few academics would take pride in associating themselves
    with the discipline. It wasn’t until the late 2000s that AI research made a comeback,
    aided with vastly superior computing resources and significant refinements to
    the architecture of neural networks and to deep learning algorithms. But the field
    focused on humble, utilitarian goals: building systems custom-tailored to perform
    highly specialized tasks, such as voice recognition, image classification, or
    the translation of text. Such architectures, although quite successful, still
    require quite a few quantum leaps to get anywhere close to AGI, and tellingly,
    the desire to build a digital “brain in a jar” is not an immediate goal for any
    serious corporate or academic research right now.'

    unlikely that life evolved on just one out of perhaps 10^(24) planets in the entire
    universe. One possible rebuttal is that the cosmos is vast, and that harsh constraints
    limit how quickly it can be traversed; it follows that we might not be alone,
    but we might very well be too far from any of the thousands or millions of space
    civilizations out there. But then, the critics argue, shouldn’t at least one life-form
    develop the ability to colonize nearby worlds, and from there, gradually spread
    to other galaxies? Humans seem to be on the verge of colonizing other planets,
    and our world has just over 4 billion years under its belt; the universe is much
    older than that.

    in different phases of matter (interstellar plasma?), or operate on timescales
    too slow for us to observe and analyze. In fact, such beings seem more likely

    fear of human-like intruders trying to make our planet their own. If such visitors
    *do* show at our doorstep, perhaps we’d be wise to start shooting and pray for
    the best; if the history of our species is any indication, encounters with more
    technologically advanced civilizations seldom end well for the more primitive
    tribes.

    work backward from this principle to devise an apocalyptic prediction of the day.
    It’s not that they’re *necessarily* wrong, but in practice, because of the lopsided

    is simple: get away from other people and learn to live off the land. It’s fairly

    couldn’t support even a tiny fraction of their current population densities—and
    in the event of a full-scale collapse, nothing but misery awaits the folks who

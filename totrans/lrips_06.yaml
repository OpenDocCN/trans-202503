    the whole country to get to the last few towns.”

    as pretty! You can tell genuine Fair Coins because they always flip heads or tails,
    fifty-fifty.”

    Fair Coins must be certified Fair.”

    trade. It so happens I’m in the market for a particular algorithm.”

    want, with a little bit of thinking.”

  prefs: []

    to make big ideas. Or you put two ideas side by side and compare them. Or you
    start with big ideas and take them apart.”

    seemed to think it was normal.

    a tough one, so you’ll have to use your imagination. I’ve asked all the adults
    and even Ponens and Tollens already, but all they do is mutter about *x* squared

    in the trenches answering calls on the help desk, visited users to tell them to
    reboot as a technician, kept servers up as a systems administrator, designed and
    built solutions as a systems engineer, and learned the difference between OSPF
    and RIP routing as a network engineer.'

    be for a particular technology. PowerShell has changed my life in more ways than
    one, and it’s the technology that’s changed the trajectory of my career most dramatically.
    This language helped me be a critical asset at my job by knowing how to save countless
    hours of my team’s work, and it got me my first six-figure salary. PowerShell
    is just so cool that I decided I had to share it with the world, and since then,
    I’ve been awarded the prestigious Microsoft MVP award for five years straight.

    build custom tools instead of buying off-the-shelf products, and link various
    tools together. You may not be interested in becoming an active member of the
    PowerShell community, but I guarantee that learning PowerShell will give you skills
    that many businesses need and actively seek.

- en: Once called *Monad* (see *[https://www.jsnover.com/Docs/MonadManifesto.pdf](https://www.jsnover.com/Docs/MonadManifesto.pdf)*)
    and pitched as a more intuitive way to automate tasks than VBScript in 2003, Microsoft
    PowerShell is a universal automation, scripting, and development language. PowerShell
    was created to bridge the gap between scripting, automation, and operations personnel.
    It was meant to enable users to automate tasks with scripts without having to
    learn computer programming. This makes it particularly useful for system administrators
    who lack a background in software development. If you’re a system administrator
    with not enough time to get everything done, PowerShell is a great ally to have.

- en: PowerShell has now become an open source, ubiquitous, cross-platform scripting
    and development language. You can use PowerShell not only to provision fully configured
    server farms, but also to create a text file or set a registry key. Thousands
    of software products and services have PowerShell support now, thanks to its ever-increasing
    adoption rate among IT professionals, developers, DevOps engineers, database administrators,
    and systems engineers.

- en: This book is for IT professionals and system administrators who are tired of
    clicking around in the same GUI and performing the same task for the 500th time
    this year. It can also be for DevOps engineers who are struggling to automate
    new server environments, perform automated testing, or automate an entire continuous
    integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) build pipeline.

- en: No single demographic benefits the most from PowerShell. The traditional job
    role of a PowerShell user is the Microsoft system administrator in a “Windows
    shop,” but PowerShell tends to fit well in the tool belt of any IT operations
    personnel. If you’re in IT and don’t consider yourself a developer, this book
    is for you.

- en: In this book, I’ll teach by doing, using tons of examples and real-world use
    cases. Instead of *telling* you what a variable is, I’ll *show* you. If you’re
    looking for a traditional textbook, this book isn’t for you.

    that’s not how you’ll use PowerShell in the real world. For example, rather than
    expect you to know the written definition of a *function* or *for loop*, I’ll
    combine features whenever possible to give you a holistic understanding of the
    problem at hand and how to solve it.

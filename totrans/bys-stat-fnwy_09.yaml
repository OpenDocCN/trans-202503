    writing *P*(*B* | *A*)*P*(*A*) instead of *P*(*A*)*P*(*B* | *A*); the meaning
    is identical, but sometimes changing the terms around can help clarify different
    approaches to problems.

- en: With Bayes’ theorem, we can reverse conditional probabilities—so when we know
    the probability *P*(*B* | *A*), we can work out *P*(*A* | *B*). Bayes’ theorem
    is foundational to statistics because it allows us to go from having the probability
    of an observation given a belief to determining the strength of that belief given
    the observation. For example, if we know the probability of sneezing given that
    you have a cold, we can work backward to determine the probability that you have
    a cold given that you sneezed. In this way, we use evidence to update our beliefs
    about the world.

    the mathematics in your mind. To do this, let’s pull out some LEGO bricks and
    put some concrete questions to our equation. [Figure 7-1](ch07.xhtml#ch07fig01)
    shows a 6 × 10 area of LEGO bricks; that’s a 60-stud area (*studs* are the cylindrical
    bumps on LEGO bricks that connect them to each other).

- en: The issue, of course, is that our yellow studs all sit on top of the space of
    red and blue studs, so the probability of getting a yellow brick is *conditional*
    on whether we’re on a blue or red space. As we know from the previous chapter,
    we can express this conditional probability as *P*(yellow | red), or *the probability
    of yellow given red*. Given our example from earlier, this would be the probability
    that a student pulled an all-nighter, given that they had failed an exam.

    far, so good. So what if we now reverse that conditional probability and ask what
    is *P*(red | yellow)? In plain English, if we know we are on a yellow space, what
    is the probability that it’s red underneath? Or, in our test example, what is
    the probability that a student failed the exam, given that they pulled an all-nighter?

    out *P*(red | yellow)by reasoning, “There are 6 yellow studs, 4 of which are over
    red, so the probability of choosing a yellow that’s over a red block is 4/6.”
    If you did follow this line of thinking, then congratulations! You just independently
    discovered Bayes’ theorem. But let’s quantify that with math to make sure it’s
    right.

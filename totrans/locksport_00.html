<div class="image1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/fm06.jpg"/></div>
<p class="noindent">Back in 2011 at the No Starch booth at DEF CON, Bill Pollock asked me if I would be interested in writing a book about lockpicking. Knowing full well my ego would agree wholeheartedly to having my name on a bookshelf, I still respectfully declined. What could I possibly bring to the table that hasn’t been said already? Several books on lockpicking already exist, and other publications can be found online.</p>
<p class="indent">Fast-forward to the world in quarantine mode. In a virtual lockpick meetup spanning three continents (and even more time zones) that Matt organized, we began discussing books. Matt had recently published a wonderful book with No Starch, <em>Pentesting Azure Applications</em>, and they would be happy to have him write another—maybe on lockpicking this time? While we were discussing this informally, we quickly noticed that our group included several experts in various lockpicking fields, and suggestions for chapters kept pouring in.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxii"/>But still, why a new book? When BandEAtoZ suggested it should be a group effort on locksport specifically, something clicked. Yes, lockpicking and impressioning information is out there, but nothing has really focused on the <em>sport</em> aspect. Books on lockpicking or covert entry often overlook information that is critical to competing in locksport competitions. Locksmithing references tend to concentrate on minutiae that is irrelevant to hobbyists.</p>
<p class="indent">That’s where this book comes in. We’ve gathered a group of rock stars from the world of locksport, each with our own area of expertise.</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="lev1a">Locksport Origin Stories</h3>
<p class="noindent">Every locksporter has a different reason why they became interested in this rather unique hobby. Your reason might be that you saw lockpicking on YouTube and thought it looked fun. Maybe you are a locksmith and decided to see if you were the fastest person in your shop to open a lock, or maybe you ran into one of us at a conference and spent some time learning to open locks. Lockpicking is a superpower, and just like comic book heroes, your reason for joining this community is your <em>origin story</em>. We wanted to share ours with you.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>Jos Weyers</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">Since a very young age, I have been curious about all things mechanical. I ruined a multitude of alarm clocks in the process of figuring out their inner workings. Recently, I progressed to doing the very same with way more expensive wristwatches. (Apparently, some kids never learn.)</p>

<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxiii"/>Being technically schooled in IT, I gravitated toward learning how to secure all the cyberz. With that interest in mind, I visited several of the Dutch, open-air hacker camps, where I was first introduced to the concept of locksport. This, of course, reignited my interest in physical things that shouldn’t be tinkered with and therefore shall be tinkered with. Buying gear on the internet wasn’t really a thing in those days, so being able to buy an actual lockpick set at these events was a very welcome concept.</p>
<p class="indent">After opening a serious number of locks, I came across a simple padlock that just wouldn’t budge (I hadn’t yet heard about the wonders of security pins). Rather intrigued with this little puzzle, I decided to visit a TOOOL meeting to get some tips and tricks. They can’t get rid of me . . . and that was almost 20 years ago.</p>
<p class="indent">During that time frame, I was elected board member and president of TOOOL, won more than a dozen championships impressioning keys, organized several LockCons, tried to buy an actual panopticon prison, lectured rather frequently about physical security and how it relates to the cyber domain, and figured out a new and novel way to easily circumvent most master-key systems by using just one key.</p>
<p class="indent">When I am not hosting impressioning workshops somewhere on this globe, I can frequently be found in Arnhem, Netherlands, at Hack42, generally considered to be the most awesome hackerspace in existence.</p>
<p class="indent">And yes, I’m devilishly handsome.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>Matt Burrough</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">When I was growing up, Ian Fleming’s novels were my guilty pleasure. After completing the assigned reading for English class, I’d often grab whatever James Bond novel I had borrowed from the library out of the bottom of my backpack and escape into a world of espionage. While a cool-under-pressure spy who makes women swoon is an obvious and perhaps cliché choice for a hero as a teenage boy, I appreciated Fleming’s work for two other reasons: the tradecraft and the gadgets.</p>
<p class="indent">I loved finding bits of tradecraft—spy tricks and methods—in the books. These details elevated the books for me from mere pulp fiction to a new way of thinking about how things in the world are not always what they first appear. Of course, I was also fascinated by the gadgets on which 007 relied and was amused seeing which of these fictionized implements had made it into real, everyday devices some four or five decades after they appeared in print. This curiosity dovetailed nicely with my interest in all things tech related.</p>
<p class="indent">Despite my love of these books, alas I was not cut from the right cloth to be a spy. Instead, I focused on my infatuation with technology and pursued a career in information technology.</p>
<p class="indent">A few years after college, I was invited to attend my first ShmooCon by a friend who lived in Washington, DC, where I encountered my first real-life lockpicks at the TOOOL lockpick village. As fun as it was popping open my first Master Lock without a key and feeling a bit Bond-like, I left the lockpicks at the conference and returned to my typical tech-worker life.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxiv"/>It wasn’t until I pivoted my career into cybersecurity several years later that I dove headfirst into the world of locksport. Shortly after I joined a red team, a fellow penetration tester invited me to a small lunchtime demonstration he had arranged in the office. Visiting Seattle from the Netherlands was Jos Weyers, who was accompanied by locksmith and locksporter Holly Poer. The two taught several of us how to pick locks, and it was then that I bought my first set of picks from Jos. That week, I attended a lock impressioning class taught by Jos and Holly at a local hackerspace and was hooked.</p>
<p class="indent">This was fantastic—as a penetration tester, I had a career that not only allowed but also encouraged me to use these newfound skills to gain access to rooms or computers that were locked away. I finally got to use the Bond skills I most admired.</p>

<p class="indent">From that point on, I attended every locksport meetup and conference I could. I enjoyed placing in contests and learning new opening techniques and about different locks I had never seen before. But even better, I got to befriend some of the most talented, most interesting, and friendliest people I’ve ever met. I hope our hobby brings you as much joy as it has me.</p>

<p class="noindent">I believe hackers are born that way. I certainly was. I wanted to know how everything worked from as far back as I can remember. Technology has always had my interest, and keys too. After visiting my grandparents, we would get a call asking if I’d taken some keys. I did take them. I was four.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1980, I spent a vacation with an Exidy Sorcerer computer my dad had taken home from work, writing programs in BASIC with my older brother. The first English words I learned were BASIC commands. The computer was magical to me and a great opportunity to learn. Three years later, I had convinced my parents to buy me a home computer.</p>
<p class="indent">I learned a ton just by reading and trying out stuff. Things got really interesting when I went to college, where I was introduced to UNIX and got access to the internet when just 100,000 academic computers were connected. The internet opened up a whole new world to explore. I became a computer hacker. No computer crime laws existed yet.</p>
<p class="indent">Several hacker groups were around that were abiding by the “hacker ethos.” I felt at home in these groups and read everything I could. <em>Phrack</em> magazine was the leading hacker e-zine, and in the Netherlands, we had <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxvi"/><em>Hack-Tic</em> magazine. In it, I read about lockpicking (which is just hacking locks, if you ask me) for the first time. Online shops or the World Wide Web did not yet exist, so I couldn’t buy tools. I tried to make my own but failed to open anything. I got so frustrated that I stopped trying.</p>
<p class="indent">I have been going to real-life hacker conventions since that time, the first ones being Hacking at the End of the Universe in the Netherlands in 1993 and Access All Areas in London in 1995. Many would follow. In 1997, I did my first real lockpicking at the Hacking in Progress event, also in the Netherlands. Finally, I had success, and I was hooked! I became a member of the newly founded Dutch lockpicking group and later started a chapter in my hometown, which I still lead 15 years later.</p>
<p class="indent">Meanwhile, I got a few jobs in IT security. I eventually joined friends to run our own penetration testing company. I could finally hack again, to improve the security posture of our clients. I also did social engineering and physical penetration testing assignments in which I picked locks guarding critical infrastructure. In the true hacker ethos, I gave back to the community by sharing knowledge at conferences, and I have spoken at a few hundred over the years.</p>
<p class="indent">I have stayed a member of the Dutch lockpicking group ever since its conception, eventually becoming president. I have been involved in organizing LockCons and am very proud of getting Tim Jenkin, who picked his way out of a South African jail, to speak at one a few years back. During these events, I’ve learned impressioning, lever lockpicking, and safe cracking. It is with pride that I now share, together with my friends, my knowledge of lockpicking with you in this book. I hope that you, in turn, will pass on the knowledge you gather in your journey.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>BandEAtoZ</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">I’ve been a longtime professional breaker of things, and locks have always been paramount in that mix. Sometimes finesse is best applied instead of brute force, and locks often provide the opportunity to apply that finesse. Automotive and heavy machinery is where I cut my teeth with picking, but it didn’t take long to add other locks to my skill set. My initial foray into opening a safe deserves a story in itself, but that is for another time.</p>
<p class="indent">After more than 20 years in the safe-technician field, I was attending some required professional development classes when I first listened to a few of the instructors bad-mouthing lockpickers on the internet. All the typical complaints, including revealing industry insider secrets, teaching criminals, and using only fake locks, were brandished about.</p>
<p class="indent">The thing was, I had long been watching very competent locksporters crush difficult locks and knew these curmudgeons’ arguments were full of hot air. I sensed that the idea of non-locksmiths wanting to fuss with locks absolutely didn’t compute in their minds. They didn’t see locks as the wonderfully engineered puzzles that they are. Their loss.</p>

<p class="figcap1"><em>BandEAtoZ manipulating a safe lock in the wild. Small indications made this a slow and deliberate opening</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">While I would love to expound on my numerous locksport interactions over the years, I am authoring this under a pseudonym in an attempt to keep me from losing access to the safe-technician cool kids club, which is still populated with many who believe that even an unauthorized gaze at a safe lock is tantamount to heresy and worth a burning at the stake. This kerfuffle over technicians’ concerns about security is still in full force despite 80 years of these common safe-manipulation techniques being prolific in print, the hundreds of videos available online, and more importantly, the continued improvements to locks that make these techniques virtually impossible.</p>
<p class="indent">So, after a handful of years skulking in the back of locksport meetings, I am now tiptoeing out. A bit.</p>
<h5 class="h5"><strong>Nigel K. Tolley</strong></h5>
<p class="noindent">What was the first lock I picked? I’m not completely sure, but I have at least three memories of picking locks from my childhood.</p>
<p class="indent">There was an old vending machine for hot drinks at my dad’s workshop. One day I watched an employee pull out some tools, jiggle something in the lock, and open the machine. He took out one of the 10-pence coins and inserted it into the coin slot to buy himself a drink. Intrigued partly by his alarm at realizing I had seen what he’d done, I investigated the lock and soon found I could do the same by using the plastic coffee stirrers.</p>
<p class="indent">I like to think that was the first lock that I picked, but there are other possibilities from around the same time. I had a younger brother, so I <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxviii"/>put a bolt on my bedroom door and a padlock on my shed. (Yes, I had my own shed! It probably explains a lot.) It was a cheap padlock, and I was lazy, so I quickly got into the habit of picking the lock rather than walking all the way into the house to get the key. I recall picking it open many, many times. With what tool, I have no idea—probably something I made in my dad’s workshop.</p>
<div class="imagec"><img alt="Image" id="fm11" src="../images/fm11.jpg"/></div>
<p class="figcap1"><em>Nigel in his workshop. Photo by Morgan Tolley, 2021</em>.</p>
<p class="indent">Around that same time, my school got new computer equipment, which was stored inside our school desk drawers. One day I watched a handyman installing the little “locks” I now know to be nothing more than a star key driving a bolt, designed for windows. After he had finished installing the lock on my desk, I asked what he was doing, and he told me he was adding locks so we couldn’t play with the equipment. I picked up his Phillips screwdriver and unlocked the drawer. His jaw dropped. I can only hope, looking back, that he was a handyman and not a locksmith.</p>
<p class="indent">I continued playing with locks over the next couple of decades, through university and a short career in aerospace, eventually starting up a locksmithing business in 2005, the same year that I first went to a TOOOL event—the Dutch national lockpicking championships at a hacker camp. I’ve never looked back.</p>
<p class="indent">The tiny niche of physical security (PhySec) is still, once you look closely, a vast, vast arena with a thousand genuine niche disciplines. Rarely do I see the same thing twice. In addition to locks, I cover alarms and CCTV, plus some aspects of information security (InfoSec)—primarily testing Internet of Things (IoT) devices for physical attack vectors. I have advised on books and film and have appeared on TV. I’ve created new CAD methods for copying the largest antique keys, and I’ve worked on photogrammetry methods for copying modern restricted keys. I’ve designed and sold several locksmith tools, one of which I bothered to patent and a few of which I’ve managed to sell to other companies. I have seen much more than <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxix"/>just lever locks in my day-to-day work: everything people have made and fitted over hundreds of years on everything from cars to vaults, castles to mobile homes, including more than a few custom creations by aspiring lock designers, well-known manufacturers, and even drug dealers!</p>
<p class="indent">I’ve recently relocated; it will be interesting to see what challenges the doors of my new home, Edinburgh, Scotland, bring.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev1b">How This Book Is Organized</h3>
<p class="noindent">The book is divided into parts that focus on various types of competitions found in locksport championships. In each part, we describe how to get started, what tools you’ll need, how to progress from beginner to advanced, and what to expect in a competition setting. If you’re new to picking locks, we suggest reading the parts in order, but more advanced locksporters should feel free to jump to a part that most interests them.</p>
<p class="blocka"><strong><a href="part1.xhtml">Part I: The Basics</a> (<a href="ch1.xhtml">Chapters 1</a>–<a href="ch5.xhtml">5</a>)</strong> This part introduces you to the world of locksport, starting with the history of lockpicking and a thorough description of various competitions around the globe, the groups that host them, and the laws that govern the sport. Then you’ll learn about types of locks; their inner mechanisms and high-security elements; and how to disassemble, troubleshoot, and maintain your practice locks.</p>
<p class="blocka"><strong><a href="part2.xhtml">Part II: Pin Tumbler Lockpicking</a> (<a href="ch6.xhtml">Chapters 6</a>–<a href="ch8.xhtml">8</a>)</strong> This first hands-on part of the book focuses on pin tumbler locks, the most common and budget-friendly type and thus a good introduction to locksport. You’ll see several models and learn how to work around various security elements. We’ll take a brief look in <a href="ch7.xhtml">Chapter 7</a> at a few locks other than the standard pin tumbler, but the principles of picking them remain largely the same.</p>
<p class="blocka"><strong><a href="part3.xhtml">Part III: Impressioning</a> (<a href="ch9.xhtml">Chapters 9</a>–<a href="ch11.xhtml">11</a>)</strong> In this part, we’ll turn to impressioning, the art of fashioning a working key from a blank by reading marks made by the lock. Once a common skill among locksmiths, impressioning is now rarely used in the field, but it has gained in popularity since its arrival on the locksport scene in the early 2000s.</p>
<p class="blocka"><strong><a href="part4.xhtml">Part IV: Safe-Lock Manipulation</a> (<a href="ch12.xhtml">Chapters 12</a>–<a href="ch14.xhtml">14</a>)</strong> The focus of this part is manipulating safe locks, a much more detailed and nuanced process than spy movies would have you believe. You’ll learn all about how to get feedback from safe locks, chart the clues you find, and zero in on the lock’s combination.</p>
<p class="blocka"><strong><a href="part5.xhtml">Part V: Lever Lockpicking</a> (<a href="ch15.xhtml">Chapters 15</a>–<a href="ch17.xhtml">17</a>)</strong> In this final hands-on part, we’ll explore the lever lock, an old but sophisticated lock style found primarily in the UK and mainland Europe. You’ll see many examples of intricate key and lock designs and then apply much of the knowledge you acquired in previous chapters to manipulate levers instead of pins in order to open these locks.</p>
<p class="blocka"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxx"/><strong>Appendixes</strong> Two appendixes close out the book. The first covers locksport games and events not included in their respective sections, and the second tells where to source lockpicking supplies in your area.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev1c">Who This Book Is For</h3>
<p class="noindent">This book is intended for anyone with an interest in locksport. Those who are just starting will learn the basics, such as tools and techniques to use. Seasoned lockpickers who are not yet competing will get information about how competitions are organized, where they are held, and how to perform well at them. Experienced locksporters will probably also learn something new, as this book covers the four main fields in locksport: picking cylinders, impressioning cylinders, opening combination safe locks, and opening lever locks.</p>
<p class="indent">Regardless of your level of experience, the tools and techniques described in this book are intended solely for the purposes of locksport. We’ll detail the rules and laws surrounding lockpicking in <a href="ch1.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, but it’s worth stating now that you should pick only locks that you own and only according to the laws of your particular area.</p>
<p class="indent">Now, without further ado, let’s get started!</p>

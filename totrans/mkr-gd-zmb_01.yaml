    that case, zombies could certainly be killed for a second time. However, we often

    increases rapidly due to zombification. However, since many humans will be eaten
    rather than turned, the zombie population will not reach the preapocalypse human

    the population of humans will stabilize at a low level.

    Judging by their hunger for human flesh, they need to eat to survive, although
    just how this works without a fully functioning digestive system is a mystery.
    In any case, since they don’t photosynthesize, their energy must come from somewhere,
    and human flesh is the most likely source. But as humans learn to survive, the
    zombie population will struggle to find food. And since zombies are essentially
    slow-moving piles of rotting flesh, they’re a carrion eater’s equivalent of a
    takeout dinner. If we added population curves to the graph for crows, foxes, wild
    dogs, and other such animals, we would probably find a massive spike in their
    populations as they cleaned up the mess in pretty short order. Thus, humans who
    fight back and plenty of natural predators will put downward pressure on the zombie
    population.

    a wise strategy. A long drive could, in theory, take you from anywhere in the
    country to the coast, but in all likelihood, the roads will be jammed with abandoned
    cars following desperate attempts to avoid the contagion. So, travel is likely

- en: You’ll want to put the contraptions you make in this book into boxes or affix
    them to walls, so it will be helpful to get hold of a drill as well as screws,
    nuts, bolts, and metal brackets. General construction tools such as a hacksaw,
    files, and a vise will come in very handy for fashioning supports and fixings
    from scrap metal or lumber. The more tools you can lay your hands on, the better.
    They can always double as weapons.

    the build. Two such modules are the Arduino ([Figure 1-5](ch01.html#ch01fig5))
    and Raspberry Pi ([Figure 1-6](ch01.html#ch01fig6)). You will find a guide to
    the Raspberry Pi in [Chapter 5](ch05.html#ch05) and an Arduino primer in [Appendix
    C](app03.html#app03).

- en: The Arduino is a microcontroller board widely used by makers and artists. It’s
    simple to use and can be programmed to read sensors and control outputs. For example,
    in [Chapter 2](ch02.html#ch02), you will use it to make a battery monitor, and
    in [Chapter 9](ch09.html#ch09), you’ll use it to control an LED flashlight to
    make an automatic Morse code beacon.

    running the Linux operating system. You can connect a keyboard, mouse, and a TV
    to it and turn it into a control center for your base. Being low power, it is
    much more suitable to run on batteries than a laptop computer would be.

    You may want to download the code to a pen drive now, just in case.'

    power that you will need for most projects. Having electricity available will
    make life easier in other ways, too, such as by providing lighting, so let’s get
    started!

<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Kryptos</em> is a sculpture located at CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#b01-endnote-1" id="b01-noteref-1">1</a></sup> It was created by Jim Sanborn, a local artist, in 1990. <em>Kryptos</em> bears an encrypted inscription, which has become the most famous crypto puzzle created in the last four decades (see <a href="#figureA-1" id="figureanchorA-1">Figure A-1</a>).</p>

<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_380" title="380"/>In addition to <em>Kryptos</em>, Sanborn placed other pieces of art on the CIA grounds, such as a number of copper sheets bearing Morse code letters.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#b01-endnote-2" id="b01-noteref-2">2</a></sup> These messages, as well as their decoded counterparts, can be seen in <a href="#figureA-2" id="figureanchorA-2">Figure A-2</a>.

<p>We’re unsure what these word fragments are supposed to mean, though Sanborn has said that they are related to the second part of the ciphertext. Note that there is an extra dash after <code>INTERPRETATI</code>, which could either mean that the final letter is a <code class="bold">U</code>, for <code class="bold">INTERPRETATU</code>, or, more likely, that the dash is the first character of the letter <code class="bold">O</code>, meaning that the entire word was intended to be <code class="bold">INTERPRETATION</code>. Similarly, <code>T IS YOUR POSITION</code> was probably originally <code class="bold">WHAT IS YOUR POSITION</code>. Sanborn has said he had longer messages on the sheets and then either cut the sheets in the middle of a message or allowed the messages to continue between the stone slabs.</p>

<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_381" title="381"/>The <em>Kryptos</em> inscription is divided into four quadrants. Two of these (the left ones when looking at the sculpture, as in <a href="#figureA-1">Figure A-1</a>) display a Vigenère-type tableau. The two other plates bear the actual ciphertext, which consists of at least four messages that are encrypted in different ways and are currently referred to in the crypto community as K1, K2, K3, and K4. In the following reproduction, we provide the entire ciphertext and indicate where each quadrant starts. (No such marks are present in the original.)</p>

<p>All four <em>Kryptos</em> ciphertext parts are covered in detail in this book: K1 and K2 in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 8">Chapter 8</span>, K3 in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 10">Chapter 10</span>, and K4 in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 17">Chapter 17</span>. K1, K2, and K3 have been solved, but K4 is still a mystery. Parts 1–3 of the Kryptos ciphertext were solved by three different individuals or groups, all independently of each other. Here, we chronicle how they were solved.</p>
<p>Shortly after the sculpture was unveiled at CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia, a team of a dozen NSA employees in Fort Meade, Maryland, were invited “across the river” to the CIA to examine <em>Kryptos</em> and its related pieces. Then, in mid-1992, after the director of the NSA, Admiral William “Bill” O. Studeman, became deputy director at the CIA, he threw down the gauntlet to his NSA successor, Admiral Mike McConnell: “How come you hotshots haven’t solved <em>Kryptos</em> yet?”</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_382" title="382"/>McConnell contacted Harry Hoover, the first chief of Z, a new organization consisting of cryptanalysts. Hoover tasked Ken Miller with being the head of the project. Miller assembled a team of three experts in “manual ciphers”: Ed Hannon, a member of Hoover’s team; Denny McDaniels, from Miller’s team; and Lance Estes, a senior cryptanalyst from elsewhere in the agency. Hannon made the first breakthrough, solving K2. Estes solved K1, and McDaniels solved K3. After the team gave up on K4 in late 1992, Hoover said that they should not reveal their results until it was solved. But in June 1993, since that outcome did not look probable, Hoover directed Miller to write up a memo, which Hoover then sent to McConnell and, from there, to Studeman at the CIA. None of this was announced publicly.</p>
<p>In 1998, CIA employee David Stein derived the three solutions as well. This news was circulated internally at the CIA, and a brief, vague mention of it was made in the press, but nothing substantial was publicly revealed.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#b01-endnote-3" id="b01-noteref-3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1999, renowned codebreaker and American Cryptogram Association member Jim Gillogly cracked the three cryptograms, too. As both the NSA and the CIA had kept their codebreaking successes secret, the <em>Kryptos</em> encryption was still considered unsolved when Gillogly announced his achievement. So, he became celebrated internationally as the first one to break the first three parts.</p>
<p>Shortly after Gillogly’s announcement, both the CIA and the NSA revealed that they had solved the three parts even earlier, though the NSA, in typical fashion, was cagey about who had done so and when. In 2004, Elonka obtained images of Stein’s CIA report, which she published on her website.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#b01-endnote-4" id="b01-noteref-4">4</a></sup> In 2010, she filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the NSA to see their documents. After multiple follow-ups, this request was finally granted in 2013, when the NSA released documents that showed how their team had managed to solve the first three parts back in 1992. Shortly after that, the CIA released a redacted version of Stein’s paper.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#b01-endnote-5" id="b01-noteref-5">5</a></sup> Both the redacted and unredacted versions are available on Elonka’s website at <a class="LinkURL" href="https://elonka.com/kryptos">https://elonka.com/kryptos</a>.</p>
<p>All three codebreakers, and likely thousands of others around the world, have tried to decipher the fourth <em>Kryptos</em> part, to no avail.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502727b01-0001"><a class="XrefDestination" id="K1"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727b01-002"/>K1</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">K1 is encrypted using a variant of the Vigenère cipher with the keywords <code class="bold">KRYPTOS</code> and <code class="bold">PALIMPSEST</code>. A <em>palimpsest</em> is a manuscript page from which the text has been scraped or washed off so that it can be reused for another text, in such a way that bits of the older message can be seen through the new.</p>
<p>Here is the Vigenère table Sanborn used; note the keywords <code class="bold">KRYPTOS</code> in the top row and <code>PALIMPSEST</code> in the first column:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_383" title="383"/><code class="bold">KRYPTOSABCDEFGHIJLMNQUVWXZ</code></p>

<p class="BodyCustom"><code>TOSABCDEFGHIJLMNQUVWXZKRYP</code></p>
<p>The K1 plaintext reads as follows. You can see that it includes a spelling error:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>BETWEEN SUBTLE SHADING AND THE ABSENCE OF LIGHT LIES THE NUANCE OF IQLUSION</code></p>
<p>When asked about the meaning of this plaintext, Sanborn replied that it is a sentence he wrote himself with “carefully chosen wording.”</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">K2 is encrypted in the same way as K1, though with a change to one of the keywords. This time, it used <code class="bold">KRYPTOS</code> and <code>ABSCISSA</code> (see <a href="#figureA-3" id="figureanchorA-3">Figure A-3</a>). An <em>abscissa</em> is the <em>x</em>-coordinate of a point on a graph. We can decipher K2 with the following Vigenère table (see also <a href="#figureA-3">Figure A-3</a>):</p>

<p class="BodyCustom"><code>ABCDEFGHIJLMNQUVWXZKRYPTOS</code></p>
<p>Here is the corresponding plaintext, which includes another spelling error, <code class="bold">UNDERGRUUND</code>:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>IT WAS TOTALLY INVISIBLE HOWS THAT POSSIBLE? THEY USED THE EARTHS MAGNETIC FIELD X THE INFORMATION WAS GATHERED AND TRANSMITTED UNDERGRUUND TO AN UNKNOWN LOCATION X DOES LANGLEY KNOW ABOUT THIS? THEY SHOULD ITS BURIED OUT THERE SOMEWHERE X WHO KNOWS THE EXACT LOCATION? ONLY WW THIS WAS HIS LAST MESSAGE X THIRTY EIGHT DEGREES FIFTY SEVEN MINUTES SIX POINT FIVE SECONDS NORTH SEVENTY SEVEN DEGREES EIGHT MINUTES FORTYFOUR SECONDS WEST ID BY ROWS</code></p>
<p>The latitude and longitude coordinates in the message (N38° 57' 6.5" W77° 8' 44") point to a spot about 150 feet (forty-five meters) southeast of <em>Kryptos</em> itself, though there does not appear to be anything unusual there; it is part of a paved and landscaped area near the agency cafeteria. The location could have some connection to the other pieces of Sanborn’s (the Morse code sections), which are located on the other side of the headquarters building. Sanborn has said that when he installed <em>Kryptos</em>, he made a point of checking the latitude and longitude from a nearby US Geological Survey marker to ensure that his coordinates were accurate.</p>
<p>In 2006, several years after the public solutions were made available, Sanborn indicated that the codebreakers had gotten the last three words of K2, <code class="bold">ID BY ROWS</code>, wrong.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#b01-endnote-6" id="b01-noteref-6">6</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#b01-endnote-7" id="b01-noteref-7">7</a></sup> It turned out that there was a missing letter <code>S</code> in the last line of the ciphertext. Sanborn had intended it to end with the words <code class="bold">X LAYER TWO</code>. The codebreakers had not noticed the error, as, by mere coincidence, the expression <code class="bold">ID BY ROWS</code> seemed to make sense. So, the actual plaintext is the following:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>IT WAS TOTALLY INVISIBLE HOWS THAT POSSIBLE? THEY USED THE EARTHS MAGNETIC FIELD X THE INFORMATION WAS GATHERED AND TRANSMITTED UNDERGRUUND TO AN UNKNOWN LOCATION X DOES LANGLEY KNOW ABOUT THIS?

<p class="BodyFirst">K3 is encrypted with a transposition cipher. It can be solved in multiple ways. One method that Elonka came up with requires that the ciphertext be written in lines of forty-eight letters, not including the final question mark. The decryption begins at the <code class="bold">S</code> found at the last position of the fourth line:<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#b01-endnote-8" id="b01-noteref-8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>ENDYAHROHNLSRHEOCPTEOIBIDYSHNAIACHTNREYULDSLLSLL</code></p>

<p class="BodyCustom"><code>AGTDHARDPNEOHMGFMFEUHEECDMRIPFEIMEHNLSSTTRTVDOHW</code></p>
<p>From there, the plaintext can be read with a simple rule: from the current position, go down four lines, and if you need to go beyond the last line, continue to the first one and go one position left. This rule gives us <code class="bold">L</code> as the second letter:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>ENDYAHROHNLSRHEOCPTEOIBIDYSHNAIACHTNREYULDSLLS</code><code class="bold">L</code><code>L</code></p>

<p class="BodyCustom"><code>AGTDHARDPNEOHMGFMFEUHEECDMRIPFEIMEHNLSSTTRTVDOHW</code></p>
<p>Next, <code class="bold">O</code> is the third letter:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>ENDYAHROHNLSRHEOCPTEOIBIDYSHNAIACHTNREYULDSLLS</code><code class="bold">L</code><code>L</code></p>

<p class="BodyCustom"><code>AGTDHARDPNEOHMGFMFEUHEECDMRIPFEIMEHNLSSTTRTVDOHW</code></p>
<p>Continuing with this method and adding a space when appropriate, the following plaintext appears:</p>
<p class="BodyCustom"><code>SLOWLY DESPARATLY SLOWLY THE REMAINS OF PASSAGE DEBRIS THAT ENCUMBERED THE LOWER PART OF THE DOORWAY WAS REMOVED WITH TREMBLING HANDS I MADE A TINY BREACH IN THE UPPER LEFTHAND CORNER AND THEN WIDENING THE HOLE A LITTLE I INSERTED THE CANDLE AND <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_386" title="386"/>PEERED IN THE HOT AIR ESCAPING FROM THE CHAMBER CAUSED THE FLAME TO FLICKER BUT PRESENTLY DETAILS OF THE ROOM WITHIN EMERGED FROM THE MIST X CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING Q</code></p>
<p>We can also derive this message using the following mathematical formula determined by crypto-enthusiast Ferdinando Stehle, in which <em>x</em> stands for the ciphertext position and <em>y</em> for the plaintext position in the transposition used:<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#b01-endnote-9" id="b01-noteref-9">9</a></sup></p>
<p class="Equation"><em>y </em>= (192<em>x </em>+ 191) mod 337</p>
<p>The text is a paraphrased excerpt from the diary of Howard Carter, the archaeologist who discovered the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun (“King Tut”) on November 26, 1922. His answer to the question, “Can you see anything?” was “Yes, wonderful things!”</p>
<p>Another interesting thing about K3 is that the letters <code>DYAHR</code> in the first line of the ciphertext are poorly aligned, as can be seen here:</p>
<figure class="graphic">
<img alt="" class="" height="49" src="image_fi/502727b01/ga001.png" width="515"/></figure>
<p>We don’t know what this means, but the artist says it has something to do with the first three parts. For more information about K3, check out <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 10">Chapter 10</span>.</p>
<p>Note that a question mark (<code>?</code>) appears between K3 and K4. For some time, codebreakers were unsure whether to interpret it as the last part of K3 or the beginning of K4, but Sanborn has said that it is not part of K4, which should be only ninety-seven characters long.</p>
<p>There are three other things of note about the <em>Kryptos</em> sculpture:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>There is an extra <code>L</code> in the Vigenère tableau. This character appears at the topmost line of one of the plates. Coincidentally (or maybe not), this is the same line where the out-of-alignment <code class="custom">DYAHR</code> letters appear on another plate (we have enlarged the letters <code class="custom">Y</code>, <code class="custom">A</code>, and <code class="custom">R</code> to indicate that they are raised). Instead of an <code>L</code>, this line should have ended with a <code>J</code>. When asked about this, Sanborn said he added the letter simply to keep things in balance, which might or might not be true, of course. Anything is possible! Some researchers have pointed out that the extra <code>L</code> might be there to draw the viewer’s eye to the line, as a way of providing a subtle hint. With Sanborn, though, it’s difficult to know one way or the other.</li>
<li>There is an extra <code>ABCD</code> in the table. Normally, a Vigenère tableau uses a single alphabet of twenty-six letters, but in the case of <em>Kryptos</em>, Sanborn provided the extra letters for a total of thirty. Why? As usual, he offers no clear answer. Perhaps it was simply to keep things balanced or to align K3 with the ciphertext on the other two panels. Or perhaps there was some other reason?</li>
<li>The reference alphabet along the top is a plain (unkeyed) <code class="bold">A</code> through <code class="bold">Z</code>. However, to perform the Vigenère encryption, Sanborn wouldn’t <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_387" title="387"/>have used a plain reference alphabet but a keyed alphabet instead. So, things are backward. This is especially interesting when we compare his Vigenère encryption to the encryption on the <em>Cyrillic Projector</em>. There, the reference alphabet was plain, but on the sculpture, the provided reference alphabet is keyed, so it’s backward there, as well! To put it another way: the system that is carved into the <em>Cyrillic Projector</em> is the one used on <em>Kryptos</em>, and the system that is carved into <em>Kryptos</em> is the one used on the <em>Cyrillic Projector</em>. This could be a mistake or a deliberate act to make things more confusing. As Sanborn would say, “It’s possible; anything’s possible!”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h1-502727b01-0004"><a class="XrefDestination" id="K4"/><span class="XrefDestination" id="xref-502727b01-005"/>K4</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The ninety-seven characters of K4 are still a mystery:</p>

<p>Between 2010 and 2020, <em>Kryptos</em> creator Jim Sanborn offered four clues with respect to K4 (see <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 17">Chapter 17</span>).</p>
<p>As of this writing, this thirty-year-old mystery remains unsolved. K4 has become one of the world’s most famous unsolved cryptograms, often mentioned in the same breath as the Beale ciphers, the Voynich manuscript, and the Zodiac Killer messages. A worldwide community of <em>Kryptos</em> enthusiasts, co-founded and headed by Elonka, focuses primarily on finding the solution to K4. Elonka’s <em>Kryptos</em> website has become the most important source for all things concerning K4, the sculpture, and the other three ciphertexts.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b06.xhtml#b01-endnote-10" id="b01-noteref-10">10</a></sup></p>

			<p class="ChapterIntro">In <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 2">Chapter 2</span>, we considered the surprisingly high odds of suffering serious injury due to falls, burns, accidental poisonings, and other seemingly prosaic mishaps that tend to happen around the home. Now, with some other preparedness topics out of the way, it’s time to revisit this topic in more detail—and see if such hazards can be reduced without sapping all the joy out of life.</p>
			<p>
				Of course, given the constant barrage of dreary headlines about cribs-o’-death, brain-eating bacteria, and dog toys laced with industrial toxins, there’s little to be gained by stoking the flames of vague existential dread. We need a way to cut through the noise of 24-hour news and home in on the real everyday risks—and on actions that can make a difference. To make the problem tractable, perhaps the most valuable heuristic is to look at our own behavior, rather than worry about the whims of fate or the inevitable mistakes of others. We might not be able to dodge the occasional <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_96" title="96"/>falling piano, nor can we get rid of all distracted drivers on the road, but we can certainly put down our <em>own</em> phone whenever we walk down the sidewalk or get behind the wheel.</p>
			<p>
				Another useful filter is to classify habits based on their utility. Some risk-taking, such as crossing the street, may be simply unavoidable and thus not worth mulling over. Other precarious behaviors, such as recreational scuba diving or driving in the Daytona 500, may be within our control but well worth the payoff, bringing us genuine joy or offering the prospect of riches down the road. But some risks are entirely unproductive, not dictated by any real need nor offering meaningful rewards. An example of an act squarely in that last department is climbing a wobbly office chair instead of fetching a sturdy stool from another room. The time and effort saved is of no practical consequence, while preventable falls—often from very modest heights and in familiar environments—easily rival car accidents in the number of injuries they cause every year.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-1" id="c09-noteref-1">1</a></sup></p>
			<p>With these two behavior evaluation tricks up our sleeve—focusing on ourselves, and considering risk versus reward—let’s have a look at ways to stamp out common dangers while still leaving plenty of room for spontaneity and adventure in our lives.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c09-0001">Defensive Driving</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Driving is widely known to be a dangerous activity; what’s far less commonly recognized is that our own driving habits significantly contribute to the problem. In 1981, Ola Svenson of Stockholm University published a seminal study showing that over 80 percent of drivers consider themselves to be better behind the wheel than most—a mathematical impossibility.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-2" id="c09-noteref-2">2</a></sup> Like many oft-cited works in psychology, the sample size was small and the phrasing imprecise, but in later years, research carried out by insurance companies broadly confirmed the result: most of us seem to believe that others drive worse and deserve the blame for accidents.</p>
			<p>Perhaps the reason for this phenomenon is that when we get behind the wheel, we get to observe hundreds of small mistakes made by strangers, but we almost never know what prompted their clumsiness; poor skill is the simplest explanation that comes to mind. In contrast, when we mess up, some force majeure always justifies it: a sudden distraction, a stressful day at work, a hurry to get to an appointment we can’t miss. In other words, it’s not the lack of skill; it’s the circumstances that made us skip a beat.</p>
			<p>
				Of course, the widespread perceived superiority is illusory: with 6 million collisions, 3 million injuries, and about 38,000 deaths every year in the United States alone,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-3" id="c09-noteref-3">3</a></sup> driving accidents aren’t an affliction of the unskilled few. What’s more, over half of all lethal crashes in this country involve just one car, meaning no other party is to blame. In such cases, the driver often simply fails to navigate a turn and hits a tree or rolls down a ravine.</p>
			<p>
				Virtually all car accidents are preventable—often in ways that are well understood but perhaps muddied by social conventions or politics. Speeding is a perfect example. In many circumstances, moderate speeding isn’t terribly dangerous, and overly zealous enforcement of speed limits is widely seen as a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_97" title="97"/>sham that pads municipal budgets and provides entertainment for local cops. Yet, behaviors that can be safe on a familiar stretch of highway in the summer can be fatal on a winding rural road in the dead of winter.</p>
			<p>As for the payoff of speeding, it tends to be minimal. At highway speeds, it takes an hour of going 10 miles over the limit to make up for being held up for several minutes at a gas station or traffic lights. That’s not to say that speeding is never defensible. In good weather, going with the prevailing flow of traffic is usually the safest choice, and in many regions, that’s faster than what the roadside signs say. But flooring it on narrow city roads or unpredictable rural thoroughfares, or driving aggressively when bad weather makes visibility or traction poor, is a prime example of taking an unproductive risk.</p>
			<p>Speaking of bad weather, winter driving is in itself a remarkably perilous task. This is in part because familiarity dulls the perception of risk: urban and suburban streets are fine most of the season, but all it takes for slick ice to form is a warm day followed by a cold night with little traffic on the road. Whenever the pavement looks even the tiniest bit suspect, it’s good to exercise the utmost care. It can be instructive to test traction by braking on straight and level or uphill sections of the road, provided that no other traffic is nearby and no other obvious dangers are in sight. Over time, such experiments can give you a better sense of which conditions carry the most risk. It’s also important to slow down well ahead of any turns, especially when going downhill or navigating an overpass. Sliding in a straight line is usually not disastrous, but losing traction while the front wheels are turned can put the car in a violent spin.</p>
			<p>
				Regarding scenarios that don’t involve skidding off the road, accidents at intersections account for a lot of pain and misery.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-4" id="c09-noteref-4">4</a></sup> It takes only one driver who misses a stop sign or guns it for the “long yellow” to put many others at risk. Because of this, it’s a good habit to approach intersections with an unrelenting degree of suspicion, scanning the road carefully and gently slowing down when the visibility of cross-traffic is poor or the intentions of other drivers are unclear.</p>
			<p>Lane changes are another surprisingly dangerous activity, often carried out too fast and without due care. At highway speeds, clipping another vehicle in your blind spot can send your car spinning. Because mistakes happen, performing lane changes slowly, so that other drivers have time to react to your errors, is always a good plan. Visibility matters too: in addition to always looking over your shoulder, proper adjustment of side mirrors is crucial and often neglected. Many novice drivers believe they need to see the sides of their car, thinking that it would help them with parallel parking and similar tricky tasks. But it’s always possible to move your head to get the correct view for such maneuvers; for normal driving, the mirrors should be set to minimize blind spots instead.</p>
			<p>
				Tailgating is an additional bad habit, especially common among city drivers who are used to congested urban streets, where less scrupulous individuals sometimes cut in line whenever they see an opening. On city roads, guarding the space in front of you may be a marginally tolerable risk, but at highway speeds, it’s a folly. It’s not just that high-speed rear-end collisions are more deadly, but that if animals or debris are on the road, the car in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_98" title="98"/>front of you might swerve out of the way, but you won’t see the danger until it’s too late. A good rule of thumb is to maintain an interval of at least 2 to 3 seconds between you and the car ahead, or more if the weather is bad.</p>
			<p>
				Finally, phones are a special menace when driving. Research has repeatedly shown that drivers engaged in phone conversations are about as dangerous as people under the influence of alcohol,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-5" id="c09-noteref-5">5</a></sup> exhibiting slow reaction times and making poor decisions on the road. Critically, the effect is nearly the same whether using a handheld phone or a hands-free device. The impairment appears to stem from the cognitive burden of trying to hold the steady pace of a conversation with a person not aware of conditions on the road, not from having one hand occupied. From this perspective, the laws mandating hands-free setups make little sense; it’s better to completely refrain from talking on the phone or texting in the car. If it’s really urgent, you can always pull over. Otherwise, it can probably wait an hour or so.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c09-0002">Working at Heights</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Few would peg changing a lightbulb or hanging Christmas lights as a particularly dangerous activity. Yet, as noted earlier in the chapter, falls rival car accidents as a cause of serious injury and death.</p>
			<p>
				Fatal falls are predominantly associated with the elderly. After the age of 50, bone density tends to decrease, and by the time we hit retirement, even fairly benign-looking falls can cause grave injury.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-6" id="c09-noteref-6">6</a></sup> This notably includes hip fractures, which condemn many survivors to hospice care.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-7" id="c09-noteref-7">7</a></sup> That said, it’s a mistake to treat fall-related injuries as a problem limited to those long in the tooth. Nonfatal falls consistently rank as the top cause of preventable hospitalizations across almost all age groups.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-8" id="c09-noteref-8">8</a></sup></p>
			<p>Contrary to what you might expect, the danger usually doesn’t stem from the distance to the ground; relatively few fall injuries involve great heights. As an example, about 160,000 ladder-involved hospitalizations occur every year in the United States, and the bulk of them involve heights below 10 feet. Of course, a well-executed jump off a chair or a step ladder poses little risk to people in their prime, but the nature of many such incidents is that they don’t allow us to land on our feet. Falling sideways, possibly hitting railings, curbs, or household furniture on the way down, can easily cause horrific compound fractures or serious neck or head injuries, often with consequences that stay with the victim for life.</p>
			<p>This isn’t to say that we need to live in constant fear of lifting our feet off the ground; it’s just that we should recognize work at heights as an intrinsically dangerous activity and plan accordingly. It helps to avoid climbing rickety furniture, such as office chairs or wobbly cabinets. Similarly, when using ladders, it pays to make sure they’re perfectly stable and set up at a proper angle. When this isn’t possible, use rope or straps to hold the ladder firmly in place, or ask another person to help. It’s also smart to wear proper footwear and durable work gloves that prevent slips.</p>
			<p>
				Ladders aside, roofs of single-family homes live in special infamy. Being a roofer is one of the most dangerous occupations in the country, well ahead of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_99" title="99"/>firefighters and police officers.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-9" id="c09-noteref-9">9</a></sup> Despite this, many homeowners are sooner or later tempted to climb their roofs—to clean the gutters, make small repairs, or retrieve lost toys. Bad idea! Because of the slope of a typical roof, it’s hard to get a grip if you start sliding back, and it’s equally difficult to regain your footing if you lose your balance. In essence, any misstep turns into a near-certain fall. Whenever possible, it’s best to avoid roof walks, but if you must, consider using an inexpensive harness in conjunction with a rope tossed across the roof and secured on the other side. You can wear special studded shoes and kneepads meant for roofing work too.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c09-0003">The Enemy in the Medicine Cabinet</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Poisonings are the last of the trio of the most important causes of unintentional injury and death—and perhaps surprisingly, they seldom involve spoiled or tainted food. For children, some incidents are caused by the accidental ingestion of household chemicals or items such as watch batteries; but for all age groups, prescription drugs account for a lion’s share of the misery.</p>
			<p>
				For the past couple of decades, the harm of opioids has dwarfed the impacts of all other drugs—a matter of the substances’ widespread therapeutic use and the tolerance and physiological dependency that builds over time. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, about one in three Americans had a prescription for opioids in 2015.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-10" id="c09-noteref-10">10</a></sup> Although most users escaped any dire consequences, the survey estimated that about 10 million people in the country succumb to opioid abuse every year. The abuse often ends in tragedy; this class of medication accounts for about two-thirds of all drug overdose deaths.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-11" id="c09-noteref-11">11</a></sup></p>
			<p>
				Many factors predispose people to addiction—poverty, unemployment, stress, a history of using other illicit drugs<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-12" id="c09-noteref-12">12</a></sup>—but not being in one of these vulnerable groups doesn’t guarantee safety. Ultimately, the prevalence of opioid addiction shouldn’t necessarily be a reason to shun a medication when it helps with debilitating pain, but it should motivate us to treat that medication with respect and to seek less dangerous alternatives whenever possible. It’s equally important to recognize that opioid withdrawal can cause debilitating side effects even for people who used the substance responsibly, making it difficult for doctors and patients to gauge whether a prescription is still needed or it would be safe to wean off.</p>
			<p>
				Many other prescription drugs carry a potential for abuse and injury, including some antidepressants, sedatives, ADHD medications, and so on. What’s perhaps less known is that non-psychoactive over-the-counter medication can be pretty dangerous too. In this context, acetaminophen is of particular note. This popular pain medication has a fairly narrow therapeutic index, meaning the difference between a helpful dose and a harmful dose is slim. The medicine can cause severe liver injury in quantities as low as 3 to 5 grams for children and 7 to 10 grams for adults. Given that a typical pill contains between 500 and 650 milligrams, this may seem like a lot—but because many “cold &amp; flu” pills, syrups, and powders also contain acetaminophen, accidental overdoses can happen when trying to combine <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_100" title="100"/>several products to combat a particularly nasty flu. All in all, acetaminophen overdoses account for around 50,000 ER visits and 500 deaths annually in the United States.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-13" id="c09-noteref-13">13</a></sup> Other comparably effective painkillers, such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or even the much-maligned aspirin,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c09-footnote-1" id="c09-footnoteref-1">*</a></sup> appear to have much better safety margins for most people.</p>
			<p>None of this means that we’d be better off throwing out the contents of our medicine cabinets and suffering through every fever or splitting headache. But it pays to read up on the drugs we take and to not get too habituated to risk.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c09-0004">Alcohol and Recreational Drugs</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Throughout the ages, attitudes toward drugs have swung back and forth between extremes. The contrast seen in the United States is particularly stark. In the 19th century, the country had opium dens in most major cities, quack doctors peddled medicine laced with heroin, and cocaine was available to order straight from the Sears and Roebuck catalog. <a href="#figure9-1" id="figureanchor9-1">Figure 9-1</a> shows an ad for one such product meant for children.</p>
			<p>
				The growing addiction epidemic eventually culminated in public outcry and federal crackdowns: the Smoking Opium Exclusion Act of 1909 and the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act of 1914. The temperance movement greatly benefited from the crisis, too, helping ratify the 18th Amendment—the ban on the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages—in 1919.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-14" id="c09-noteref-14">14</a></sup></p>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_101" title="101"/>In the decades that followed, the abject failure of alcohol prohibition efforts exhausted the social capital of anti-drug activists, setting the stage for the drug-, sex-, and music-fueled hippie movement of the 1960s. The movement, in turn, fed into a moral panic that precipitated the Nixon-era War on Drugs, later expanded under Reagan in response to the crack cocaine epidemic and the massive spike in urban crime.</p>
			<p>Today, the pendulum of drug policies is swinging again toward liberalization. In just a couple of years, most states either legalized marijuana or removed the associated criminal penalties. Initiatives to legalize other psychoactive substances are gaining steam, too, with Oregon leading the way with psilocybin in 2020. It’s hard to know whether the country is reaching a stable equilibrium or future generations will once again decide that the societal ills of drug use outweigh the benefits. But without getting into the long-term merits or harms of such policies, one thing is clear: impaired judgment is still impaired judgment, and being under the influence of any mind-altering substance inherently increases our likelihood of waltzing into trouble or getting hurt.</p>
			<p>
				Today, alcohol remains a distinctive menace. In theory, most people know to never drink and drive, but the adherence to this mantra is spotty at best. Drunk driving accounts for about a third of all traffic deaths in the United States, and about a million people are arrested for driving under the influence every year—with millions more undoubtedly just not encountering any traffic stops.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-15" id="c09-noteref-15">15</a></sup> But the drug of choice doesn’t matter much. Even with comparatively safer marijuana, and even when the user decides to stay home and binge-watch <em>Sabrina the Teenage Witch</em> instead of driving around town, the risk of injury is still higher than before. When intoxicated, it’s easier to forget about food in the oven, to light a candle and put it in the wrong place, or to react inappropriately to an unfolding emergency.</p>
			<p>The other peril of drug and alcohol use is less acute. Even in the absence of physiological addiction, substances can be habit forming when they become an everyday method of unwinding, detaching from stress, and having a good time. At that point, it can be hard to think clearly about the impacts such behaviors have on one’s career, hobbies, or relationships.</p>
			<p>I’m not here to proselytize about the dangers of an occasional beer. Most drinkers don’t become alcoholics, most users of pain medication don’t become addicted, and most pot smokers don’t become potheads. But substance dependence is a sneaky and unpredictable foe. The surest way to avoid this risk is to scale back. It’s quite easy to be silly, bond with friends, or have fun without chemical aids—so recreational drugs arguably make for another example of an unproductive risk.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c09-0005">Workshop and Power Tool Safety</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Woodworking and DIY home improvement are some of the most popular hobbies in America. Reputable statistics are elusive, but by one industry survey, around 17 million US households partake in wood crafts of some sort.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-16" id="c09-noteref-16">16</a></sup> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_102" title="102"/>Against the backdrop of far more pastoral avocations such as scrapbooking and sewing, garage-based pastimes tend to involve major power tools and carry pronounced risks.</p>
			<p>The task of running a safe workshop can be made difficult because of information overload. We live in an era when hammers and toilet plungers come with warning labels, and when the instruction manual for every toaster devotes several pages to telling us not to gnaw on the wires and cautioning us that the ejected toast may be hot. Flipping past the safety instructions has become a natural instinct—and even the most diligent reader may have difficulty distinguishing between real hazards and the overzealous base-covering of a compliance officer who’s trying to make sure that no consumer can ever sue the company for any conceivable harm.</p>
			<p>
				Thankfully, statistics on workshop injuries are tracked fairly well in this country. They paint a clear picture too: of common garage tools, table saws emerge as by far the worst offenders, accounting for around 40,000 hospital visits and 4,000 amputations a year.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-17" id="c09-noteref-17">17</a></sup> Such injuries often start with the material catching on the rear of the spinning blade and shifting violently. The ejected workpiece can cause injuries on its own, but a far more serious problem is that the operator’s hand is all of a sudden pushing nothing but air, potentially making contact with the blade before there’s a chance to react. The instinct to grab the piece as it slips away can make things worse. Thankfully, the basic cure to table saw woes is simple: always use push sticks or sleds that keep your hands well clear of the danger zone and not in direct contact with the machined piece.</p>
			<p>Another common garage tool known for causing severe injuries is the angle grinder, a device where a brittle abrasive wheel spins at extreme speeds and can shatter when driven too hard—or for no discernible reason at all. Such a fracture can send sharp and extremely fast-moving pieces of shrapnel toward the face of the operator or toward people nearby. Face shields, or at the very least impact-resistant safety goggles, are a must. Keeping the plane of the wheel away from the body and properly positioning the guard can also help.</p>
			<p>Many other power tools deserve deep reverence; for example, planers, jointers, miter saws, routers, and lathes are well-known for mangling the extremities of tens of thousands of people every year. Similarly, many gruesome injuries and deaths are attributed to outdoor equipment such as lawnmowers, snowblowers, wood chippers, and chainsaws. When operating such devices, always follow all the applicable safety tips. If the manual is too obtuse, look up reputable tutorials and accident reports on the internet. Perhaps the most general safety principle can be borrowed from the world of firearms: when working with tools that can maim in the blink of an eye, always make sure that at least two separate things need to go wrong before any serious harm can occur.</p>
			<p>
				In addition to your fingers and arms, your hearing and eyesight are also worth preserving. For obvious reasons, putting on eyewear should become a habit when working with any caustic chemicals, as well as when dealing with any machining operations that can eject chips or bits of damaged tools. Hearing protection is a more difficult sell, as the injury tends to happen <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_103" title="103"/>very gradually and without any pain. Many people don’t realize the extent of the damage until they start having trouble understanding others around the house. Earmuffs are a good idea around any power tools, but especially when working with the ultra-loud ones: table saws, chainsaws, planers, nail guns, and so on.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c09-0006">Fireproofing the Homestead</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">It’s the hallmark of lazy screenwriting that every fictional house fire must either claim a life or have its hapless victim rescued in the nick of time. In reality, domestic fires are common, but fatalities are comparatively rare. The total number of victims hovers around 2,500 a year,<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-18" id="c09-noteref-18">18</a></sup> with many cases involving very young children, intoxicated individuals, and the infirm. The number of serious burns and smoke inhalation injuries is more significant, but remains a far cry from other causes discussed in this chapter so far. Still, fires make for a worthwhile topic: even when all residents escape bodily harm, the mental scars of losing one’s home can take a long time to heal—and the odds of a disaster are well within our control.</p>
			<p>As hinted earlier in the book, the bulk of household fires begin in the kitchen, where food is often left unattended in the oven and where flammable items may be placed near or around the stove top. Keeping the kitchen tidy and not storing plastics or cardboard anywhere near the sources of heat is a good habit to have; so is always setting a loud alarm clock to help keep track of time when baking or slow-cooking any foods.</p>
			<p>Working fire alarms and reasonably sized fire extinguishers are a wise investment. Nuisance alarms can be dealt with by switching to photoelectric sensors or by simply repositioning the sensor away from where you cook. Talking to children about escape routes is another low-effort strategy to manage risk. Kids are more vulnerable than adults and less able to reason through a traumatic experience; they should know we won’t be upset with them if they rip out a window screen to exit their room.</p>
			<p>Beyond that, it’s wise to examine your daily routines and surroundings for other places where fires can easily start. Space heaters are a notorious culprit, especially when placed on uneven or cluttered surfaces. The same goes for poorly maintained appliances, such as dryers with vents clogged with decades’ worth of lint, and for damaged or overloaded outlets and extension cords. Finally, candles, cigarettes, and smokable drugs account for a relatively small portion of all fires, but cause a disproportionate percentage of deaths, especially when the user falls asleep.</p>
			<p>Threats inside the house aside, rural property owners should contemplate creating a defensible space around the homestead. The usual recommendation is to maintain a zone of around 30 feet around the home that is free of fuels such as coniferous trees or dry grass, leaves, and shrubs; and then about 100 feet where the vegetation is judiciously thinned and all flammable debris is removed. Such steps can greatly reduce the intensity of flames and thus improve the odds that the house will still be standing where you left it once the smoke clears.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502123c09-0007"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_104" title="104"/>Other Dangers in and Around the Home</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Many other injuries feature prominently in ER statistics, but didn’t make the cut for close discussion in this book. Some are simply not gruesome enough to worry too much about: for example, major cuts happen all the time in the kitchen, and sometimes they need stitches or even nerve repair—but except for concert pianists or a handful of other professions requiring top-notch fine motor skills, they don’t matter much in the long run.</p>
			<p>
				Some other dangers that lurk around the home are serious but difficult to control. Choking, for example, is a major risk for young children and the elderly, but effective mitigations—beyond learning the Heimlich maneuver—are tough. Similarly, suffocation and drowning are two common causes of death for infants and toddlers; the latter can be partly managed by keeping toddlers away from backyard pools and teaching them to swim, but many other interventions are of dubious utility. For instance, consumer-type infant oxygen monitors are probably bunk science and a waste of your hard-earned cash.<sup class="endnote"><a href="b02.xhtml#c09-endnote-19" id="c09-noteref-19">19</a></sup></p>
			<p>Of course, it’s difficult to provide a comprehensive compendium of all dangers that may be relevant to every lifestyle. Everyone faces their own unique hazards, from motorcyclists, to avid skydivers, to fanciers of venomous snakes. The examples outlined in this chapter point to some of the most common harms and the most universal ways of dealing with the risks. As always, however, they merely serve as stepping stones for fleshing out a personalized action plan.</p>

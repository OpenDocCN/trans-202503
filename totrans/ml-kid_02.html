<p>The computer will make a random choice from rock, paper, and scissors, and will display a cartoon to represent its move. It will use your ML model to recognize your move based on your hand shape, and then show a message saying who won (see <a id="figureanchor4-13" href="#figure4-13">Figure 4-13</a>).</p>

<h2 id="h1-500563c04-0002">Review and Improve Your Project</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">You’ve trained an ML model to recognize pictures of three different hand shapes! Try experimenting with it to see what makes it work well and what makes it make mistakes.</p>
<p>Remember that the ML model isn’t starting from an understanding of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game or the meaning of your different hand shapes. It can only learn from the patterns in the example photos that you’ve taken.</p>
<p>Imagine you took all of the rock training example photos with your hand very, very close to the webcam so that your hand looks huge, and that you took all of the scissors training example photos with your hand very, very far away from the webcam so that your hand looks tiny. A computer could assume that this size pattern was significant and learn that large hands mean “rock” and small hands mean “scissors.” That means that it could recognize a photo of any large hand making any hand shape as “rock.”</p>
<p>Now imagine you took all the rock training example photos with your hand coming in from the left, and all of the paper training example photos with your hand coming in from the right, as shown in <a id="figureanchor4-14" href="#figure4-14">Figure 4-14</a>. A computer could assume this direction pattern was significant, and learn that a hand facing to the right means “rock,” and a hand facing to the left means “paper.” That means it could recognize a photo of any hand shape facing to the right as “rock.”</p>
<span epub:type="pagebreak" title="47" id="Page_47"/><figure>
<img src="Images/f04014.png" alt="f04014"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure4-14" href="#figureanchor4-14">Figure 4-14:</a> Computers can learn from unexpected patterns in the training data.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We only use the labels on the training buckets to make it easier for us to organize our projects. The computer doesn’t take the labels into account when it looks for patterns in the training examples. If you hid the labels and asked a friend to guess what the photos in each set in <a href="#figure4-14">Figure 4-14</a> have in common, they might say, “Those hands are all pointing to the right, and those hands are all pointing to the left.” ML models work in a similar way, so they might learn to recognize misleading patterns.</p>
<p>The background of the photo can have a similar impact. I helped a student once who accidentally discovered this when creating this project. His face was included in all of the rock and paper training photos, but both his face and a classmate were included in all of the scissors training photos.</p>
<p>When he tested his project in Scratch, it seemed to do a good job of recognizing his hand shapes, until I came to stand next to him and watch. When I stood next to him, no matter the hand shape he made, his project almost always thought that he was showing scissors. </p>
<p>Although he hadn’t realized it at first, he had trained his ML model to recognize the difference between photos with one or two people in them. It had learned to recognize photos with two people as “scissors.” </p>
<p>If you don’t want any of these misleading patterns to affect your ML model, it helps to include <em>variety</em><em/><em/> in your training examples. Your project will work best when your training photos include a lot of very different photos of the same subject. When taking rock <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="48" id="Page_48"/>training photos, make a rock shape from every different angle and direction that you can. Take some photos that are close up and large, and some that are farther away and small. If you can take photos with different backgrounds, even better. If the only thing that your rock training examples have in common is a fist hand shape, that will be the pattern the computer learns to recognize.</p>
<p>We’ll learn more about how to confuse ML models in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 14">Chapter 14</span>, but for now remember: <em>if the pictures in each training bucket have only one thing in common with each other, then that’s the only pattern that the ML model will learn to recognize</em>. </p>
<h2 id="h1-500563c04-0003">What You Learned</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">In this chapter, you’ve trained another ML model to recognize pictures. In <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 3">Chapter 3</span>, you used this to do a job: sorting photos. This time you used it to play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against your computer by having it recognize your hand shape. Both of these projects demonstrate <em>image recognition</em><em/> and are good examples of how it is used every day.</p>
<p>You’ve learned that the basic approach for training computers in image recognition is to collect example photos, and you’ve learned the important lesson of avoiding misleading patterns in your training data to improve your results. </p>
<p>Computers can learn to recognize more than just what’s in a picture, however, so in the next chapter you’ll see some other patterns that ML models can learn. </p>

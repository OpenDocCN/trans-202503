- en: Why do the lights in a house turn on when you flip a switch? How does a remote-controlled
    car move? And what makes lights on TVs and microwaves blink? The technology around
    you may seem like magic, but most of it wouldn’t run without electricity.

- en: '*Electronics for Kids* demystifies electricity with a collection of awesome
    hands-on projects. In [Part 1](part01.xhtml#part01), you’ll learn how current,
    voltage, and circuits work by making a battery out of a lemon, turning a metal
    bolt into an electromagnet, and transforming a paper cup and some magnets into
    a spinning motor. In [Part 2](part02.xhtml#part02), you’ll make even more cool
    stuff as you:'

    like logic gates and memory circuits—as you make a secret code checker and an
    electronic coin flipper. Finally, you’ll use everything you’ve learned to make
    the LED Reaction Game—test your reaction time as you try to catch a blinking light!

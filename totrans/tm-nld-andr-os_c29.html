<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">O</span>ne of the ongoing debates on the team in those early times (and for years afterward) was: were they building a product or a platform? That is, were they trying to build one or more phones (products), or an operating system that would be usable across many different phones, from various manufacturers, now and in the future (a platform)?</p>
<p>It is clear now, especially given the breadth of the Android ecosystem, that Android is a platform. Yes, it runs on Google’s phones, including generations of Nexus phones and the more recent Pixel phones. It also runs on many more phones across the world, most of which have never been seen by anyone on the Android team, but all of which run Google apps and the Google Play Store as part of the Android ecosystem. But at the time, it wasn’t clear what the priorities should be. Since 1.0 was clearly targeting the G1 phone, the distinction between the two was muddied. Further complicating the debate was the fact that building a specific product is always going to be easier (and faster) than building a more flexible platform for the long term. So if Android’s main priority was just getting something to market, focusing on a product was the right call.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the iPhone took a very product-focused approach. As Bob Borchers (then Senior Director of Product Marketing for iPhone) said, “At that point, we weren’t really thinking of iOS as a platform.” In fact, the App Store wasn’t even part of the plan for that first device; the iPhone was just an Apple device with Apple apps. This approach enabled Apple to focus on getting the details for that specific product exactly right.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_274" title="274"/>Apple has had many follow-on phones since then, and now has the App Store and a large developer ecosystem. But they always know exactly what products they are building for and can tune the OS and the platform they ship appropriately. Google has also shipped many phones . . . but that number is insignificant compared to the quantity and variety of devices shipped by other manufacturers. So it is far more important for Android to be portable to all of those devices than it is for it to be perfect for Google devices but difficult for OEMs to deal with.</p>
<p>The product-versus-platform debates on the team were represented by the different companies that people came from: Danger, Be/PalmSource, and WebTV/Microsoft. The people from Danger preferred simpler solutions, which gave them more of a product focus. The people from Be/PalmSource and WebTV/Microsoft had more of a platform mindset and preferred that approach for Android as well.</p>
<p>Romain Guy said, “The folks that came from Palm worked on Palm OS 6, with compatibility for Palm OS 5. They saw firsthand what would happen to an OS that was not built for the future, that didn’t have any concept of resolution, GPU, stuff like that.”</p>
<p>Brian Swetland saw both sides, having worked at both Be and Danger. “You need both. It was a lesson I took away from Be. Be would get in a rut on that at times—so focused on being the platform. If you don’t do real apps and you just build a pure platform, then you’re not closing the loop. You don’t build what people need.”</p>
<p>Brian said that the debate on the Android team continues. “I don’t think it ever became clear, to this day. This used to drive Andy batshit. We would have the all-hands meeting, and I or Dave Bort would ask what we were building. We were definitely building a platform and there were products in that platform. But were we building The Google Phone, a vertical thing, our product? Or were we building something we were expecting the OEMs to build phones on under their brand? Or something in between? Over the years, we did a bit of everything. </p>
<p>“The Nexus devices, and now the Pixel devices, feel much more vertical. But there’s this whole wide ecosystem where people do all kinds of crazy things. Then you have Amazon and Fire where they’re taking the platform as a starting point to build their own platform that’s derived from it but not the same.”</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_275" title="275"/>Mike Cleron said that Dianne “had the clearest vision of ‘This is not just launch G1, live to fight another day.’ She was laying foundations for things that were over the horizon, certainly for me, probably for most people. Dianne in 2006–2007 saw things that we wouldn’t need until 2013, and somehow engineered those into some of the foundational concepts of Android.”</p>
<p>The debate was also happening in the Google boardroom. Executive reviews at the time showed Google’s top execs fell at different ends of the spectrum: some prioritized Android building a phone, some favored the platform approach, and some fell somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>Dianne summed up the debates: “Platform or Product: That was always the Danger versus Palm OS people. Andy’s answer was, of course, ‘Both.’ Which was the right answer.”</p>

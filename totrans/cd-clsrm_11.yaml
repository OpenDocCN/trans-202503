- en: We live in times that are simultaneously disquieting and awe-inspiring for many
    people. Technological change is accelerating and impacting every facet of our
    lives in new, unanticipated ways. Although many people feel threatened by automation,
    artificial intelligence, and ubiquitous computers, others feel energized and excited
    to engage with these innovations and the incredible potential they present.

    If they were privileged enough, they might have gone to schools that had one or
    two computers as a curiosity. Now they’re seeing everything from dedicated computer
    labs to schools providing Wi-Fi to students who carry phones with more computing
    power than the supercomputers of just a half-century ago. They saw chess programs
    evolve from being novice players to beating grandmasters. They saw programming
    hobbyists transition from painstakingly copying programs from magazines to instantly
    forking entire programs from online repositories.

    can often correlate with how confident you feel assimilating to it. Computers
    have grown more powerful by leaps and bounds throughout recent decades, and that
    can be unnerving. But they’ve also grown far more accessible during that same
    time, and that should feel inspiring.

    into the world. To teach computer science is to demystify computer systems and
    infuse students with a sense of amazement for them as our collective human accomplishment.
    We can instill students with wonder and excitement for whatever is coming next.

    Children who understand conditional logic can invent engaging games to share on
    the playground. A student with cursory programming skills can execute a single
    line of code that drastically changes a web page. Students who are comfortable
    with code can take snippets from many sources to assemble explorable explanations
    that will enlighten and delight their peers. These students are making magic,
    and when they bring others into these realms they’ve engineered, they inspire
    others to make magic.

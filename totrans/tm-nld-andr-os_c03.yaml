- en: Toward the end of 2004, the small Android startup needed reinforcements. Andy
    and Chris provided enough engineering and design wherewithal to get some of the
    initial vision and technology working. But when they started pitching actual products
    to investors, they needed an engineering team to help create the platform and
    technology demos while the founders worked on the business.

    team) had been a systems programmer.

    with membrane keyboard, on our kitchen table over two or three evenings and hooked
    it up to a crappy old black and white TV. You could type things in BASIC. It did
    stuff—it was this magical thing. And you learn life lessons that stick with you,
    like which end of the soldering iron to never pick up.”

    finish his computer engineering degree. “Sophomore year I didn’t make it to classes
    for a large chunk of it. Projects with the local ACM chapter, a job at NCSA SDG,
    and working on the X/Mosaic web browser had distracted me. Then finals happened,
    and it wasn’t pretty.” But hobby programming led him to Be, and he captured the
    company’s interest while trying to get BeOS to work on his PC.

- en: When Be released a version of their OS for PCs, Swetland installed the CD on
    his computer. But it didn’t quite work. “It didn’t recognize my hard drive, because
    I only had SCSI^([1](#c03-footnote-1)) drives in my PC. So I found the manuals
    for the bus logic SCSI controllers I had and thought, ‘This doesn’t look that
    complicated.’ I emailed Dominic Giampaolo, one of their engineers who was active
    on Usenet.”^([2](#c03-footnote-2)) Dominic emailed Swetland a sample SCSI driver
    for the BeBox hardware.

    I had. I got it booting, but there was some problem; the disk size was coming

    wrong: I think there’s an endian^([3](#c03-footnote-3)) bug in the mid-layer.’'

    a trip to California and a full day of interviews at the company, including a
    live debugging session with Dominic, Brian had a job offer. He returned home,
    packed up his things, and moved to California two weeks later. He had gone to
    college with the goal of eventually writing operating systems. With the opportunity
    to start on that immediately, he figured a college degree could wait.

- en: Two years later, in May of 2000, Swetland left Be for Danger, joining former
    Be (and future Android) colleague Hiroshi Lockheimer. At Danger, Swetland worked
    on the kernel and other system software, and helped to ship the first couple of
    Hiptop devices. But after the first few years, most of the work tended to be incremental
    improvements, or features implemented at the request of the carrier (or killed
    on their behalf; even sometimes killed based on what product managers thought
    the carrier *might* request). Eric Fischer, who worked on text and other platform
    features at Danger (and later Android) said, “Everything we did there was in the
    shadow of the slow, conservative carrier acceptance process that could veto any
    feature or design.”

- en: Swetland was always more interested in building new systems than iterating on
    existing ones, and he was getting frustrated. Danger had become a much larger
    organization of about 150 people by 2004, far from the tiny team he joined back
    in 2000\. It had also been four years of long hours, first helping Danger as a
    struggling startup, and then working to ship the company’s first two phones. So
    in September of 2004, he took three months off to recover from burnout and frustration.

    into his hiatus, he realized he was pretty happy not being at work. He also realized
    he’d continue to be happy if he continued to not go back to work. More specifically,
    he realized he really didn’t want to go back to work at Danger.

    employees when he started. So when he was searching around for new opportunities,
    he reached out to Andy. After all, Andy had founded an interesting company in
    the past; maybe he’d have more ideas. And he did; Andy had started Android with
    Chris White, and they were looking for their first employee.

- en: At that time, in the Fall of 2004, the startup was focused on an open source
    camera operating system. Andy pitched the camera OS idea to Swetland, who was
    intrigued. If nothing else, it was a chance to work on another new operating system,
    which is what he loved. And at least it wasn’t phones again; he had had enough
    of that tumultuous domain during his time at Danger. So he signed up, planning
    to start when he finished his break.

    a prototype to help visualize a nonexistent experience. Fadden’s job was to take
    this concept demo, which Swetland and Chris had been working on, and start adding
    real capabilities, including applications. The startup had to be able to show
    potential investors what real users could actually do with this future system.

- en: The for command is easily the most indispensable and cardinal command in all
    of the Batch coding universe. Loops would be nearly impossible without it, and
    it comes in a number of forms with many options and keywords to perform varying
    and diverse tasks. This command commands its very own section of the book that
    you’re now holding.

- en: If the for command had no options at all, it would still be the most powerful
    command in Batch, and I’ll detail this optionless variant in [Chapter 17](chapter17.xhtml).
    But the command also sports four incredibly impressive options. In [Chapter 18](chapter18.xhtml),
    I’ll introduce the options that handle directories, recursion, and iterative loops.
    In [Chapter 19](chapter19.xhtml), you’ll learn about the file reading option,
    which is actually a misnomer because it unlocks an awesome amount of functionality
    far beyond the reading of files. We'll finish up with a discussion on advanced
    techniques concerning the for command in [Chapter 20](chapter20.xhtml).

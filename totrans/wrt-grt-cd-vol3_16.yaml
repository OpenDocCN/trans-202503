    to the list. About the only thing I can promise is that there won’t be as large

- en: Volume 4, *Designing Great Code*, will pick up where the second half of this
    book left off. In this volume you’ve learned how to document the software development
    process; in Volume 4 you’ll learn more about the design process and how to apply
    the knowledge you’ve gained to design great code.

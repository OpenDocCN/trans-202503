<p class="noindent">Congratulations on making it through eight chapters of Scratch-assisted math and math-assisted Scratch! Hopefully, what you’ve read here has inspired you to keep experimenting and learning more. This chapter offers some ideas about where to look next, whether you want to try out another programming language or you’re looking for new math problems and hacks to solve them.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3a" id="ch09lev1">Learning Other Languages</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">I learned to program in FORTRAN and COBOL back in the early 1970s, writing my code on punched cards between the magical job control cards and waiting at the computer center for the printed output. At a meeting of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) at Dartmouth College in 1972, I was amazed when I had the chance to try out John Kemeny’s BASIC on a time-sharing printing terminal. I could never have imagined that one day there would be a language like Scratch that was accessible to everyone, with a drag-and-drop interface, integrated sound and graphics, and the ability to perform complex calculations in the blink of an eye.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_166"/>The resources that the internet makes available on demand have reshaped the world. And yet, the first program I wrote in FORTRAN in 1970 (after “Hello, world!” of course) was a basis-conversion utility like the ones in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1</a> for converting between binary and decimal. The toolbox of computing has changed dramatically over the years, in terms of the resources available, capabilities, and ease of use, but the mathematical ideas to be explored still have the same foundations.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">These days, I wouldn’t recommend learning FORTRAN or COBOL, but there are other programming languages you may want to explore. In <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1</a>, we discussed how the floating-point representation of numbers in Scratch limits the range of numbers that can be studied. Other languages are designed without these limitations, or they have standard extensions available to overcome them. Two of these languages, Python and Mathematica, are readily available and likely to be of interest for people with Scratch experience. Both are bundled with the Raspberry Pi computer, along with Scratch. Mathematica is a commercial product that runs on Linux, Windows, or macOS, while Python is freely available for download from <em><a href="https://www.python.org">https://www.python.org</a></em> for many operating systems.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">These two languages are especially useful for exploring applications of number theory because they natively support arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic—there’s no overflow and no rounding. For example, <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch9fig1">Figure 9-1</a> shows Mathematica’s calculation for 2<sup>106</sup> (flintmax squared), the same large value we wrote a Scratch program to calculate in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1</a>.</p>&#13;

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 9-2: Calculating 2<sup>106</sup> in Python</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_167"/>Not only is the calculation done with all digits reported and the answer given as a number rather than as a string, but the languages have native power operators (<span class="literal">**</span> or <span class="literal">^</span>) that make exponential expressions easy to write without coding a loop.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch09lev2">Finding More Problems</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">If you want more math problems to explore beyond the ones in this book, the first place to look is in the world around you. You might see a list of numbers and wonder “What if . . .?” or notice a pattern and think “That’s neat!” With Scratch, you can investigate to see what happens next. Does the pattern continue? If it does, it might be time to look for a reason. If the pattern breaks down, maybe there’s a little extra side condition you can add to fix it and save the day.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">There are also lots of problems that have been posed by other people that you might want to investigate. A problem posed by someone else is guaranteed to be interesting to at least one other person (the one who proposed it), and it’s likely to be a Goldilocks problem: not so easy that nobody cares, and not so hard that nobody can solve it.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">My all-time favorite website for problems that use computers to support mathematics is Project Euler (<em><a href="https://projecteuler.net">https://projecteuler.net</a></em>). It offers a collection of over 800 problems to solve, with more added all the time, providing a treasure trove of computational challenges of varying types and levels of difficulty. You can track your progress and earn awards for solving certain problems, and there’s a forum where you can chat with fellow solvers who share their insights and their code.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As the Project Euler site says, each problem has been designed according to a “one-minute rule.” This means that although it may take several hours of thinking and coding to design a successful algorithm for solving a problem, an efficient program will allow even a modestly powered computer to produce the answer in less than a minute. For example, here’s the first problem on the site:</p>&#13;
<div class="bq">&#13;
<p class="blockquote">If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.</p>&#13;
<p class="blockquote2">Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1,000.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s take a Scratch approach to it!</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch09lev3">Project 33: Hacking Project Euler Problem 1</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><a href="ch09.xhtml#ch9fig3">Figure 9-3</a> shows some code that sums all the multiples of 3 or 5 up to a given limit.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_168"/><img id="ch9fig3" src="../images/pg188_Image_237.jpg" alt="Image" width="814" height="688"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 9-3: The code for Project Euler Problem 1</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">It’s a <span class="literal">repeat</span> loop that tests each number from 1 up to one less than the specified upper bound (the problem description says “below 1,000,” so we don’t include the upper bound itself in the loop <span class="ent">❶</span>). We use the <span class="literal">mod</span> block to check for divisibility by 3 or 5 <span class="ent">➋</span> and increase the <span class="literal">sum</span> if either divisibility condition holds.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch09lev4">The Results</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Let’s see what Scratch Cat has to say about the problem. <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch9fig4">Figure 9-4</a> shows a solution for the upper bound of 1,000.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img id="ch9fig4" src="../images/pg188_Image_238.jpg" alt="Image" width="788" height="409"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 9-4: The answer to Project Euler Problem 1</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">It certainly takes Scratch less than a minute to generate the answer!</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch09lev5"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_169"/>Hacking the Code</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The Project Euler problem asked us to find the sum of all multiples of 3 and 5 below 1,000, and Scratch Cat reported an answer of 233,168. The problem description also gave 10 as an example and reported a sum of 23. What if we try other powers of 10? <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch9tab1">Table 9-1</a> shows some results.</p>&#13;

</table>&#13;
<p class="indent">It looks like a pattern is emerging (look at all those repeated 3s and 6s!), but when we get to higher powers of 10 the code bogs down. The problem is that the program screens each number, so it has to count all the way up to the ending value. It takes 1 million times as long to count to 1 billion as it does to count to 1,000. That means even if your computer can count to 1,000 in 1 second, it will take 1 million seconds, or over 11 days, to count to 1 billion. Depending on how patient you are, this may be too long to wait for an answer.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Ideally, there would be a way to add up all the multiples of 3 or 5 without counting them all one at a time. The key is to see that the multiples of 3 added together are 3 + 6 + 9 + . . . = 3(1 + 2 + 3 + . . .) and to then recognize that 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . is a sequence of triangular numbers, like the ones we discussed in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4</a>. Likewise, the multiples of 5 added together are 5 + 10 + 15 + . . . = 5(1 + 2 + 3 + . . .).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We have a formula from <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4</a> for calculating the <em>n</em>th triangular number, which was derived from <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch4fig13">Figure 4-13</a>:</p>&#13;
<div class="imagec"><img src="../images/pg189_Image_239.jpg" alt="Image" width="169" height="56"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">We can use this formula to streamline the counting process, as shown in <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch9fig5">Figure 9-5</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_170"/><img id="ch9fig5" src="../images/pg190_Image_240.jpg" alt="Image" width="741" height="879"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 9-5: A triangular number approach for Project Euler Problem 1</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">First, we make a custom block to calculate the <em>n</em>th triangular number <span class="ent">❶</span>. We then use this block three times in our main program. The first time, we pass in <span class="literal">floor of range/3</span>, then multiply the result by <span class="literal">3</span>. This gives us the sum of all the multiples of 3 up to <span class="literal">range</span>. The second time, we pass in <span class="literal">floor of range/5</span> and multiply the result by <span class="literal">5</span>, which gives us the sum of all multiples of 5 up to <span class="literal">range</span>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Adding these two numbers together gets us close to the answer, but there’s a problem: any multiples of 15 have been counted twice, as multiples of 3 and multiples of 5. So we use the <span class="literal">Triangular</span> block one more time, passing in <span class="literal">floor of range/15</span> and multiplying the result by <span class="literal">15</span>. This gives us the sum of all the multiples of 15 up to <span class="literal">range</span>, which we subtract from <span class="literal">sum</span> to get the final result <span class="ent">➋</span>. This hack is a general trick called the <em>principle of inclusion–exclusion</em>; you can use it anytime you want to keep track of how often multiple overlapping conditions are satisfied without counting the overlaps twice.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Sure enough, this code gives output matching the first version of the program, with the advantage that it gives the answer quickly all the way up to flintmax.</p>&#13;

<p class="noindent">If you’ve burned through Project Euler and you’re ready for more, here are some search terms you can try out in your favorite search engine that might lead you to some other interesting problems:</p>&#13;
<div class="bq">&#13;
<p class="blockquote"><strong>Math challenge problems</strong> This will probably turn up problems with lots of different difficulty levels; choose the ones that are right for you.</p>&#13;
<p class="blockquote"><strong>Scratch challenges</strong> A lot of these focus on graphics and games, but you’ll find some math challenges, too.</p>&#13;
<p class="blockquote"><strong>Scratch math games</strong> This is more likely to turn up math-focused exercises and ideas.</p>&#13;
<p class="blockquote"><strong>MAA <em>Convergence</em></strong> This will lead you to a journal of the Mathematical Association of America, <em>Convergence</em>, that has a nice list of open access problems organized chronologically, geographically, or by subject. The emphasis isn’t usually on programming, but sometimes a little bit of experimentation is a good way to understand what’s going on.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="ch09lev16">Conclusion</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Scratch is like a mental amplifier, letting you see more deeply into patterns than you could on your own. We’ve used Scratch in this book to explore arithmetic, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_174"/>number theory, geometry, cryptography, sequences, and arrays—and that’s just the beginning of what it can do.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Whether you stick with Scratch or go on to other programming languages, the algorithms and the way of seeing the world with computer-aided vision that Scratch provides can help you be a more creative thinker. I hope to see you someday at my Scratch studio (<em><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/29153814">https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/29153814</a></em>), and I’d love to see any variations or extensions of this book’s programs you decide to share. Until then, keep on coding!</p>&#13;

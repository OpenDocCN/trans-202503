    projects . . . but not on Android. The engineers in London made Google apps and
    services work on the plethora of mobile platforms and devices available at the
    time. Prior to the iPhone and Android (and for the first couple of years after
    they launched), there were many phone platforms being used in the world, and Google
    wanted to make its apps available on them.

    such as Cédric Beust,^([1](#c18-footnote-1)) who led a team getting Gmail to work
    on mobile devices. But eventually, Google started a new office in London, with
    the charge of creating software for Symbian and Windows Mobile, two of the most
    prevalent mobile OSes at the time.

    about why London was chosen for this work: “In 2007, the core mobile expertise
    was in Europe, not the US. Europe had 3G well before the US. If you look at the
    mobile OSes developed at the time, the center of excellence was in Europe. Symbian^([3](#c18-footnote-3))
    was developed in London, Series 60 and UIQ^([4](#c18-footnote-4)) were things
    developed on top of Symbian by Nokia and Ericsson. So Google made a conscious
    decision to create a mobile center of excellence in London.'

    attract talent from all over the world, and there are excellent computer science
    schools across Europe. And geographically it makes sense,” since London is one
    of the closest major European cities to California (where Google’s headquarters
    are located) and there are direct flights between the two.

    cell, the magnifying glass from a family projector, a tape recorder, a speech
    synthesizer, and some code he wrote and created a device that would fire a rubber
    band at anyone who entered his room. “I was hooked. My poor sister.”

    ran the engineering team at a startup. By 2007, he decided he wanted more experience
    than he could get at that small company, so he took a job at Google leading the
    new mobile team. He wanted to move to Silicon Valley at the time, but London was
    where the opportunity was.^([5](#c18-footnote-5))

    search and browser-related work. The team made Google’s software in these areas
    work on a variety of non-Android devices. On the side, Dave started playing around
    with Android, learning the APIs and how to program Android apps.'

    be a large event in London, and Rich Miner asked Dave to give a talk about Android,
    introducing the SDK to that audience. So Dave did some live coding^([6](#c18-footnote-6))
    in front of the crowd, creating a simple web browser application in eight minutes.

    day. “I got an email from Andy Rubin, going ‘Who the hell is this guy and why
    is he talking about my project publicly?’” Apparently, Rich hadn’t gotten around
    to telling Andy that he’d asked Dave to do this.

    a PhD program in Wales. Eventually the money ran out on the research grant, and

    London and started there in April of 2007, working on Andrei’s Lithium project.

    if the browser you use on your phone didn’t come with the phone, but had to be
    downloaded as a separate application. The prototype was promising, but . . . huge.
    Lithium required users to download what was a very large (especially for that
    time) binary for their phones. The project was killed and Andrei’s team started
    working on Google Gears instead.

- en: Google Gears was an effort at Google to provide richer capabilities for browsers
    at that time, such as local storage and geolocation.^([9](#c18-footnote-9)) Gears
    was eventually discontinued when these capabilities became standard in browsers
    with HTML5\. Gears launched for desktops in 2007, and Andrei’s team made it work
    on mobile browsers.

    SDK launched, it was clear that the Android platform and product would exist at
    least to some extent. So the team worked on porting Gears to the Android browser.
    Gears continued to ship as part of the browser until it was finally deprecated
    in the Donut release, in late 2009; it made more sense to integrate those features
    directly into the browser instead.

    just casually contribute code to Android. In fact, they couldn’t; nobody outside
    of the Android team even had the rights or permission to do so.^([10](#c18-footnote-10))
    But the work on Andrei’s team was important enough to the Android platform to
    include them. Andy granted Andrei’s team full source code access, making them
    the only team outside of Android with access at that time.

    part of the overall browser team. Andrei’s team focused primarily on forward-looking
    browser features. For example, they worked on creating and implementing the web
    standard for geolocation. They also made the video element^([11](#c18-footnote-11))
    (another feature in HTML5) work in the browser.

    disbanded the mobile effort, including Dave Burke’s London team. Mobile projects
    were absorbed into the individual product teams instead. The landscape of mobile
    computing and devices had changed radically since the time that the mobile effort
    was first begun. The iPhone had been out (and popular) since mid-2007, and Android
    was launching soon. Smartphones were ushering in a new world where mobile apps
    were going to be increasingly important for the company, and the company was incorporating
    mobile capabilities more directly into its products.

    to dedicate increasing effort and people to the project. In 2013, the Android
    browser (and WebView) was replaced by Chrome on Android, when the company decided
    that having multiple teams and projects focused on similar technology goals probably
    didn’t make sense. WebView and the browser are still an important part of the
    mobile technology stack, allowing users to browse rich websites and allowing developers
    to write applications using web technologies.

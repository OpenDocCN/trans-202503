<p class="noindent">The word <em>digit</em> derives from the Latin word <em>digitius</em>, meaning finger or toe. Of course we take this as the origin of our counting digits zero through nine, which we can match with our fingers (or toes). These digits form the basis of our base-10 or decimal number system. The positional number system commonly in use today is called the <em>Hindu–Arabic numeral system</em>. The works of Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizm̄ī (for example <em>On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals</em>, c. 825) were influential in the introduction of this system. The innovation was using the position of each digit to represent which power of 10 to multiply the digit by. This made calculations much simpler than using other systems, such as Roman numerals.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The decimal number system assigns to each digit position a power of 10, starting with the rightmost digit in a string of digits. The meaning of a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_318"/>string of digits is then derived by multiplying each digit by the corresponding power of 10, as seen in <a href="app01.xhtml#chAfig1">Figure A-1</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/Afig01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap" id="chAfig1"><em>Figure A-1: Base-10 positional values</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This is taken to mean the following:</p>&#13;
<p class="center">271828 = 2 ⋅ 10<sup>5</sup> + 7 ⋅ 10<sup>4</sup> + 1 ⋅ 10<sup>3</sup> + 8 ⋅ 10<sup>2</sup> + 2 ⋅ 10<sup>1</sup> + 8 ⋅ 10<sup>0</sup></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A concise way to represent this value is as follows:</p>&#13;
<div class="image1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/p0318-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Here <em>d</em><sub>0</sub> = 8, <em>d</em><sub>1</sub> = 2, …, <em>d</em><sub>5</sub> = 2—the digits from least to most significant.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The decimal system isn’t the only possible number system. Any integer greater than 1 can be used as the base of a number system. If you were a citizen of a universe where people only had eight fingers (see <a href="app01.xhtml#chAfig2">Figure A-2</a>), you’d probably use the octal (or base-8) number system.</p>&#13;

<p class="figcap" id="chAfig2"><em>Figure A-2: The octal digits</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Numbers in bases other than 10 are normally printed with the base as a subscript of the number. A number in the octal system would be printed as 1234<sub>8</sub>. We can convert this to decimal as follows:</p>&#13;
<div class="image1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/p0318-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">As is well known, computers internally work strictly on the binary (or base-2) number system. Three binary digits are capable of representing the numbers from 0 to 7, which, as we’ve seen, form the basis of the octal number system. Four binary digits can represent the numbers from 0 to 15 (the base-16 digits). Since the numbers 10 through 15 take more than one decimal digit to represent, the letters A through F are used instead. That is, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_319"/>A=10, B=11, etc. This is known as the hexadecimal number system. For example, the number FACE<sub>16</sub> = 64206, as shown below.</p>&#13;
<div class="image1"><img alt="Image" src="../images/p0318-03.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Two hexadecimal digits (or eight binary digits) constitute what’s called a byte. Bytes aren’t usually used as a number basis, but they’re a common unit used to designate the size of computer memory.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here’s some Racket code that takes a positive decimal integer and returns a list consisting of the digits that form the binary representation of the number.</p>&#13;
<pre>(define (decimal-&gt;bin n)&#13;
  (let loop ([n n] [l '()])&#13;
    (if (zero? n) l&#13;
        (let-values ([(n d) (quotient/remainder n 2)])&#13;
          (loop n (cons d l))))))</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">This works by extracting the least significant (rightmost) binary digit and reducing the value of <em>n</em> by dividing by 2 to get to the next digit.</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; <span class="codestrong1">(decimal-&gt;bin 15)</span>&#13;
'(1 1 1 1)&#13;
&gt; <span class="codestrong1">(decimal-&gt;bin 10)</span>&#13;
'(1 0 1 0)&#13;
&gt; <span class="codestrong1">(decimal-&gt;bin 64206)</span>&#13;
'(1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Racket also provides the ˜<span class="literal">r</span> function, which takes a base-10 value and outputs a formatted string in another base.</p>&#13;
<pre>&gt; <span class="codestrong1">(~r 64206 #:base 2)</span>&#13;
"1111101011001110"&#13;
&#13;
&gt; <span class="codestrong1">(~r 64206 #:base 8)</span>&#13;
"175316"&#13;

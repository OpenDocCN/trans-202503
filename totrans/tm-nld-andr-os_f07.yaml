- en: Thanks to Romain Guy, without whom this book would never have happened. Not
    only did he bring me onto the team (even having to try twice before it actually
    worked), but he was instrumental in helping me develop the ideas of the book (some
    of which came from presentations we’ve given together at tech conferences). He
    also assisted in many of the interviews I conducted for the book. Oh, and he wrote
    a lot of the code that many of us still work on and billions of people use today.

  zh: 感谢Romain Guy，没有他，这本书就永远不会实现。他不仅让我加入了团队（即使我尝试了两次才成功），而且在帮助我发展这本书的构思方面发挥了重要作用（其中一些想法来自我们一起在技术会议上做的演讲）。他还协助了我为这本书进行的许多采访。哦，他还写了很多我们现在仍在使用的代码，数十亿人每天都在使用这些代码。
- en: Thanks to my wife Kris, for her thoughtful insights and assistance in the very-early
    and very-late stages of this project, along with her expert editorial feedback
    many times along the way. Also, thanks for not killing me for allowing the project
    to dominate our home lives for so very, very long. It’s done now. I think.

  zh: 感谢我的妻子Kris，在这个项目的早期和晚期阶段给予的深思熟虑的见解和帮助，还有她在过程中多次提供的专业编辑反馈。另外，感谢她没有杀了我，因为我让这个项目占据了我们家庭生活这么久。现在它完成了。我想是的。
- en: Thanks to Tor Norbye, my long-time co-host (along with Romain) for *Android
    Developers Backstage*,^([2](#f07-footnote-3)) a podcast where we talk to other
    Android developers about how Android works. Some of the interviews we’ve done
    (including those with Ficus Kirkpatrick, Mathias Agopian, and Dave Burke) contributed
    directly to this story, since they were about Android history. But all of them
    contributed to my love of talking to people about what they do that became the
    genesis, heart, and soul of this project.

  zh: 感谢Tor Norbye，我的长期合作伙伴（与Romain一起）*Android Developers Backstage*播客的共同主持人，在这个播客中，我们与其他Android开发者讨论Android的工作原理。我们做过的一些访谈（包括与Ficus
    Kirkpatrick、Mathias Agopian和Dave Burke的访谈）直接为这个故事做出了贡献，因为它们讲述了Android的历史。但所有的访谈都激发了我与人们交谈他们工作内容的兴趣，这成为了这个项目的起源、核心和灵魂。
- en: Thanks to Dan Sandler for his excellent, fun artwork adorning the cover and
    pages of this book. I always enjoyed seeing his cartoons left like fingerprints
    on whiteboards when he would visit the Mt. View offices and I love seeing his
    drawings here, capturing the playfulness in the team and the product.

    polished, pulled together, cleaned up, and generally readable. I first worked
    with Laureen on technical articles I wrote (and she edited) while we were at Sun
    Microsystems many years ago. It was a pleasure to renew that relationship and
    have her return to clean up my messes once again.

- en: And a special callout to Dave Burke, VP of Android engineering at Google. Dave
    agreed that this was a story worth telling and helped me cross the hurdles that
    tend to crop up when telling a story from the inside about a company, its people,
    and its products.

- en: Apologies to all of those people who also helped out building Android in those
    early days whom I didn’t get a chance to talk to. I would happily have carried
    on doing interview after interview (by far the most fun part of the entire project),
    learning about the people, what they worked on, where they came from, and how
    they helped create this thing. But at some point, I needed to actually finish
    the book.

  zh: 对于那些在早期帮助构建Android的人，我感到抱歉，因为我没有机会与他们交谈。我本可以继续进行一次又一次的采访（这是整个项目中最有趣的部分），了解那些人、他们做的工作、他们的背景，以及他们如何帮助创造这个东西。但到了某个时候，我必须实际完成这本书了。
- en: And thanks to all of the Android employees, past and present, who selflessly
    gave of their time, opinions, and stories, so that I could better tell the story
    of what actually happened way back then. I’d particularly like to thank everyone
    that helped out with interviews, both conversational and through email. Nearly
    everyone I asked was not only willing to put up with my questions, but was enthusiastic
    about the project and our conversations.

- en: I’d also like to thank the many people who took the time to read the draft and
    offer feedback. Code is always better for being reviewed, and so is this book.
    I would particularly like to call out the significant efforts of a few of the
    people who carefully went through the entire thing, identified gaps, caught redundancies,
    corrected mistakes, provided additional information, and generally added hugely
    to the final product by their careful review of the manuscript. I’m pretty sure
    that there was another entire book written in the feedback comment threads of
    this book. In particular, Dianne Hackborn, Brian Swetland, and Andy McFadden were
    all incredibly responsive, thoughtful, and complete in their reviews, which helped
    with the technical accuracy of the result. Also, thanks to my friend Alan Walendowski
    for an eleventh-hour read and review that helped catch lingering issues that are
    so difficult to see after re-reading and re-editing the same text so very, very
    many times.

    Hackborn、Brian Swetland 和 Andy McFadden 都在审阅过程中非常积极、细心和全面，这对结果的技术准确性帮助很大。同时，感谢我的朋友
    Alan Walendowski 在最后关头进行了审阅，帮助发现了那些在多次重读和修改后仍然难以察觉的潜在问题。

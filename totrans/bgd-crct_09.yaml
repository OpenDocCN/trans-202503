- en: In this circuit, you’ll build a musical instrument with four buttons that play
    four different tones.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To create sound, you need to send an oscillating voltage to the speaker. So,
    you’ll use a 555 timer to create a voltage that goes on and off rapidly—meaning
    a few hundred times per second!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The value of capacitor C1, the value of resistor R5, and the resistance between
    pins 6 and 7 will set the tone of the sound. You’ll place resistors between each
    pushbutton, so pressing a button affects the circuit’s resistance. That means
    the resistance between pins 6 and 7 will differ depending on which button you
    push, resulting in a different tone for each.

- en: A pushbutton has four pins. When you look at it from the point of view shown
    in [Figure 8-1](ch08.xhtml#ch08fig1), the two pins in front are always connected
    to each other. The same is true for the two pins in the back. When you push the
    button, the front pair gets connected to the back pair.

- en: My preferred way to connect the pushbuttons for this project is across the gap
    in the middle of the board, as shown in [Figure 8-2](ch08.xhtml#ch08fig2). This
    gives you plenty of room to connect the resistors and necessary wires. Don’t worry
    about the rotation, as the pushbuttons will only fit one way.

    button S1\. Then add the three other buttons once you’ve gotten the first one
    working.

- en: '*Make sure the resistor R6 is in series with the speaker for two reasons: (1)
    to limit the current to the speaker so that even very small speakers don’t break
    and (2) to make sure you don’t destroy the IC by squeezing out more current than
    it can handle.*'

- en: In the previous chapter, you learned how the 555 timer works. This circuit works
    in the same way, except that in [Project 7](ch07.xhtml#ch07) the output turned
    on and off slowly, maybe one time per second. In this circuit, the output switches
    on and off several hundred times per second!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The capacitor C1 and the resistors R1 to R5 determine how frequently the output
    (pin 3) switches between a high and a low voltage. To calculate the exact frequency
    of the sound you hear, you’ll use the formula for the switching frequency of a
    555 timer:'

    the value of resistors R2 to R5\. Try changing in increments of 100 Ω first, and
    then in smaller and smaller increments to fine-tune the tone. Connecting two resistors
    in series gives you a total resistance equaling their sum.

    exercise, from defining a topic to creating the exercise materials. By the end,
    you’ll have chosen a topic, crafted a scenario and injects, designed a storyboard
    and ground truth document, and assembled your presentation deck.

- en: Depending on the particulars of each tabletop exercise, you might occasionally
    skip some of the steps outlined in this chapter. For example, the exercise topic
    might emerge quickly after a vice president tells you, “We need to practice our
    ability to respond to a business email compromise.” Many tabletops are developed
    in this fashion; you’ll know some of the initial components (such as the scope
    and topic) and fill in the rest (like duration and goals) based on what is already
    in place. As with each chapter, you should take stock of the organizational dynamics,
    business requirements, and unique threat landscape of your organization before
    you proceed.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The tabletop exercise’s *topic* is the overarching issue to explore. It could
    be an information security–related issue (such as ransomware, an insider threat,
    or phishing) or a disaster scenario impacting the organization’s ability to respond
    to information security events (such as a hazardous train derailment or hurricane
    that prevents the organization’s staff from being able to work). Ideally, you
    should choose a topic that your organization wants to prepare for and won’t flummox
    exercise participants when revealed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The specific topic isn’t as important as you might believe, however, because
    you can take almost any topic in a variety of directions. For example, an exercise
    with ransomware as its topic could explore the lateral movement of the attacker
    (that is, how an attack spreads throughout a network), responses to regulatory
    entities, business continuity issues, or investigatory actions. You could just
    as easily explore those issues in exercises based on the topic of a nation-state
    attack or a vendor security failure.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The topic can be used as an opportunity to consider an area that piques participants’
    interest. If the organization has a certain issue on its radar, selecting a related
    topic could make the exercise especially salient to participants and other stakeholders.

    outlining the possible business impact of various disruptions to business functions
    and processes—you can use it to help choose your tabletop exercise topic.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Granted, the BIA may focus on a wide spectrum of events, from natural disasters
    to civil unrest to supply chain interruptions; however, it also likely touches
    on cybersecurity issues, including ransomware, leaks of protected data (such as
    intellectual property and personally identifiable information, or PII), and loss
    of critical computing infrastructure. The BIA may also describe an entire scenario
    in which a cybersecurity event impacts the organization. If so, you could use
    this as your topic.
  prefs: []

    to pull in yet another collaborator: the subject matter expert who spearheaded
    the BIA, whether their background is in disaster recovery, risk management, or
    another area. You can enlist this expert to briefly speak at the beginning of
    the tabletop exercise to explain that the topic was chosen because of its significant
    impact on the organization, reinforcing the exercise’s importance.'

    (such as an incoming hurricane or snowstorm) but neglected to plan for a cybersecurity
    incident that could have some of the same impacts. The tabletop exercise could

    with the information security teams to ensure that they consider cybersecurity
    events in the future.

    the executive sponsor. More likely than not, they have a particular cybersecurity
    concern in mind. And even if the topic you choose doesn’t reflect the sponsor’s
    individual interests, you should seek their feedback to ensure that they’re supportive
    of and invested in the tabletop exercise topic; not having an executive sponsor
    supportive of your tabletop exercise topic is counterproductive and should be

    but hasn’t provided parameters for the scenario. If you find yourself in this

    scenario that highlights a known or potential weakness in the organization’s environment.
    Organizations often perform tabletop exercises following a cybersecurity incident
    as part of the “lessons learned” process, when they’ve shored up known deficiencies
    and want to determine whether there are residual shortcomings to address.

    in their security practices, such as retaining important logs for only a few days.
    This may occur because the team has been unable to obtain funding to store logs
    for a longer duration. The exercise provides an opportunity to explore the impact
    of the deficiency during a cybersecurity incident response. Playing out the scenario
    in front of leadership might prompt the organization to address the weakness and
    secure additional funding.

    Cybersecurity Advisory highlighting a new ransomware variant.

    to the selected scenario, as it has already been shown to be plausible and to
    have a demonstrable impact on the organization.

    vulnerabilities, but the business unit resisted risk management’s calls to address
    it, weaving these details into a scenario will likely earn support from the risk

    organization that its data may have been stolen, to name a few. This catalyzing

			<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="DropCap">B</span>arreller Bot has seemingly eternal forward propulsion in a given direction. Put simply, it has a motor that acts as an off-centered weight inside a can. When gravity pulls the weight (that is, the motor) down, the can rolls forward. A normal can would likely stop rolling at that point, but this can has a tilt switch that turns the motor on when it drops, causing the motor to rotate back upward (and turn off again), which restarts the process. If you can imagine<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_86" title="86"/>this happening really quickly and for a sustained amount of time, you’ll understand what this bot does. The Barreller has the appearance of rolling forward on its own and even doing seemingly impossible things like rolling up inclines. This bot is great fun. If you don’t believe me, build one for yourself. It’s quick and easy to do.</p>

			<h2 id="h1-500235c08-0001">Barreller Overview</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">The Barreller is built inside a paint can (I used a clear novelty can). Before you do anything, make sure you have modified the continuous servo motor for direct drive (<span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 4">Chapter 4</span>) or are using one of the geared motor alternatives, as outlined in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Appendix A">Appendix A</span>. Once that is complete, the next step is building the inner “weight” mechanism, which is essentially a circuit consisting of a motor, battery pack, and tilt switch. You’ll insert this mechanism into the can and attach it to the center.</p>

				<li><span class="RunInHead">Step 1.</span> Take apart both paintbrushes such that you are left with the two wooden handles.

					</li>
				<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_87" title="87"/><span class="RunInHead">Step 2.</span> Put batteries into the battery holder and lay it down on top of a zip tie with the batteries facing down. Place the motor on top of the battery holder so that the servo horn sticks off perpendicularly in one direction and the wooden handles are sticking off in the opposite direction. Zip-tie everything firmly together until it is one singular unit and won’t pull apart.

					</li>
				<li><span class="RunInHead">Step 3.</span> Twist together the black wire from the motor with the black wire from the battery holder and solder the connection. Solder the red wire from the battery holder to the little spike that sticks out of the tilt switch. Solder the red wire from the motor to the conductive metallic shell of the tilt switch. When the tilt switch is activated, electricity will flow between the spike and the outer shell.

				<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_88" title="88"/><span class="RunInHead">Step 4.</span> Prepare the can by removing anything that will prevent it from rolling, such as handles, and clean out anything that may be inside.</li>
				<li><span class="RunInHead">Step 5.</span> Print (or trace) and cut out the template. Tape the template to the bottom of the can and drill the four smaller holes with a 1/8-inch drill bit or one appropriately sized for your zip ties.

			<p class="ChapterIntro">Some of the coolest computers you can hack into are all around you every day, but you probably don’t think of them as computers. Many home appliances—like thermostats, security cameras, refrigerators, and Alexa or Google Home speakers—have a computer inside. These days, even cars have internet connections and computer systems that can be attacked by unethical hackers.</p>
			<p>
				Internet-connected computing devices embedded in everyday objects are known as the <em>Internet of Things (IoT)</em>. IoT devices make our lives easier or better, but they can also pose serious security risks. Internet-connected medical devices may help keep us healthy and allow the manufacturer to monitor and update them remotely, but imagine if an attacker could hack someone’s pacemaker or insulin pump to harm the user. Likewise, satellite radio, GPS navigation, and 4G/5G wireless entertainment systems in your car make long road trips more convenient and fun, but all of those <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_126" title="126"/>networks bring additional vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit. Imagine if someone hacked into your car and made it brake suddenly on the highway.</p>
			<p>Ethical hackers hack IoT devices to find issues before attackers use them to do real damage. In this chapter, you’ll see how it works. You’ll hack into a simulated car network, watch the network messages the car sends, and write commands to control the car’s dashboard.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502000c10-0001">Installing the Car-Hacking Software</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">For this hack, we’ll install a software package called <em>Instrument Cluster Simulator (ICSim)</em>, a virtual dashboard that will let you see and interact with a speedometer, turn signals, and door locks just as you would in an actual vehicle. Craig Smith (aka zombieCraig) and the OpenGarages team built the ICSim to help hackers and researchers learn how to work with automobile networks safely and ethically, without damaging or destroying an actual vehicle or unsuspecting pedestrian.</p>
			<ol class="decimal">
				<li value="1">Open a terminal window and update Kali’s software package list:
					<pre><code>kali@kali:~$ <code class="bold">sudo apt update</code></code></pre>
			</li>
				<li value="2">Now install ICSim’s dependencies by entering the following:
					<pre><code>kali@kali:~$ <code class="bold">sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev can-utils</code></code></pre>
					<p class="ListBody">Note that both of the <code>libsdl2</code> packages are spelled with a lowercase letter <em>L</em> before the number 2.</p>
					</li>
				<li value="3">Install ICSim like this:
					<pre><code>kali@kali:~$ <code class="bold">cd ~ </code>
kali@kali:~$ <code class="bold">git clone https://github.com/zombieCraig/ICSim.git</code> </code></pre>
			</li>
				<li value="4">Set up can-utils on your machine:
					<pre><code>kali@kali:~$ <code class="bold">cd ~</code>
kali@kali:~$ <code class="bold">git clone https://github.com/linux-can/can-utils</code>
kali@kali:~$ <code class="bold">cd can-utils</code>
kali@kali:~/can-utils$ <code class="bold">make</code>
kali@kali:~/can-utils$ <code class="bold">sudo make install</code></code></pre>
			</li>
				<li value="5">Set up the ICSim dashboard simulator software with these commands:
					<pre><code>kali@kali:~/can-utils$ <code class="bold">cp lib.o ~/ICSim</code>
kali@kali:~/can-utils$ <code class="bold">cd ~/ICSim</code>
kali@kali:~/ICSim$ <code class="bold">make clean</code>
kali@kali:~/ICSim$ <code class="bold">make</code></code></pre>
			</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now to run our virtual car instrument panel and start hacking!</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502000c10-0002"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_127" title="127"/>Preparing the Virtual CAN Bus Network</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">An automobile’s network is known as a <em>CAN bus</em>, or simply <em>CAN</em>. The CAN bus has been used in most automobiles since the 1990s to control various systems and sensors, like steering and braking, radios, air conditioners, and entertainment centers. The ICSim software you just installed creates a <em>virtual CAN (VCAN)</em> bus network that we’ll learn to attack. We’ll create that network now and finish setting up your car-hacking environment.</p>
			<ol class="decimal">
				<li value="1">To set up the VCAN, enter this command at the terminal inside the ICSim folder:
					<pre><code>kali@kali:~/ICSim$ <code class="bold">sh setup_vcan.sh</code></code></pre>
			</li>
				<li value="2">Ensure that VCAN was set up correctly by entering <code class="bold">ip addr</code> in a terminal. You should see your IP address along with a new network named <em>vcan0</em>.
					<pre><code>kali@kali:~/ICSim$ <code class="bold">ip addr
</code><var>--snip--
</var>3: vcan0: &lt;NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 72 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000 link/can</code></pre>
			</li>
				<li value="3">Enter the following in the terminal to tell it to first run ICSim using the vcan0 network we just created and then wait for our commands:
					<pre><code>kali@kali:~/ICSim$ <code class="bold">./icsim vcan0 &amp;</code></code></pre>
					<p class="ListBody">You should see a simulated dashboard like the one shown in <a href="#figure10-1" id="figureanchor10-1">Figure 10-1</a>.</p>

			<p>The controller app is the only way to interact with the VCAN—unless we hack it.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502000c10-0003">Hacking the Car</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Our car-hacking adventure will follow the same steps you’d use to test the security of most IoT devices:</p>
			<ol class="decimal">
				<li value="1">Use a program to view and record traffic on the vcan0 network between the controller app and the dashboard. This kind of program is called a <em>packet sniffer</em> because messages sent on the network are called <em>packets</em>.</li>
				<li value="2">Identify what network packets and commands control what car systems or functions.</li>
				<li value="3">Take control of the car by resending the packets you’ve captured back over the vcan0 network or by writing your own commands from your terminal.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 id="h2-502000c10-0001">Viewing Packets</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">We’ll use <code>cansniffer</code>, the packet sniffer built into can-utils, to listen to our simulated car network.</p>
			<ol class="decimal">
				<li value="1">In your terminal window, launch <code>cansniffer</code> with the following command:
					<pre><code>kali@kali:~/ICSim$ <code class="bold">cansniffer -c vcan0</code></code></pre>
			</li>
				<li value="2">Make the terminal window tall and narrow (as shown in <a href="#figure10-3" id="figureanchor10-3">Figure 10-3</a>) to make the <code>cansniffer</code> messages easier to see. You may also need to reduce the font size by pressing <span class="KeyCaps">CTRL</span> and − a few times.</li>
				<li value="3">Click in the CANBus Control Panel window and send some commands to the virtual car. Try accelerating, using the turn signals, and so on.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				The <code>cansniffer</code> tool intercepts packets being sent on vcan0 between the controller app and the dashboard and displays them in the terminal window. Each line in the window represents one packet. The network transmits several hundred packets per second, so they go by quickly.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_130" title="130"/>Let’s look at an example packet to see what information we can find. Here’s one of the packets shown in <a href="#figure10-3">Figure 10-3</a>:</p>
			<pre><code><span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotationCode">1</span>0.204188 <span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotationCode">2</span>244 <span aria-label="annotation3" class="CodeAnnotationCode">3</span>00 00 00 01 06 <span aria-label="annotation4" class="CodeAnnotationCode">4</span>.....</code></pre>

				The first column is a <em>timestamp</em> <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">1</span> that represents when the packet was sent. The second column <span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotation">2</span> is the ID number of the system a message is being sent to or from. As we’ll discover, CAN ID# 244 represents the speedometer. The third column <span aria-label="annotation3" class="CodeAnnotation">3</span> is the CAN message data, represented by hexadecimal values, and the fourth column <span aria-label="annotation4" class="CodeAnnotation">4</span> contains the same data represented in printable characters.</p>

							The <em>hexadecimal</em>, or base 16, number system uses the numbers 0 through 9 and the letters <em>A</em> through <em>F</em> to represent “digits” from 0 to 15. The letter <em>A</em> in hexadecimal represents the value 10 in decimal (our normal number system), <em>B</em> is 11, and so on.</p>

			<p>Experienced hackers know how to analyze the traffic picked up by a packet sniffer to determine what different packets mean. This takes practice and patience. For now, try accelerating a few times by pressing the up arrow in the controller app while watching for ID# 244 in the terminal window. Look for changing values in the message data column as you speed up and slow down. Recognizing this pattern is a clue that ID #244 refers to the speedometer.</p>
			<p>
				Now press the turn signals (the left and right arrows) and watch for ID# 188. It should appear when you touch the turn signals and disappear a few moments after you turn them off. Lock and unlock the doors using the left and right <span class="KeyCaps">SHIFT</span> keys, or the right <span class="KeyCaps">SHIFT</span> key plus X, Y, A, and B, and watch what changes in the data next to ID# 19B. The row for 19B should appear only for a moment when you’re locking or unlocking doors.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_131" title="131"/>Press <span class="KeyCaps">CTRL</span>-C in the terminal window to stop <code>cansniffer</code> when you’ve experimented enough. Don’t worry if the packets were going by too quickly for you to pick out specific IDs. The next step will be to record some packets so you can study them in your own time.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-502000c10-0002">Capturing Packets</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">The can-utils tool <code>candump</code> records messages from a CAN bus so that we can analyze them further or even replay them.</p>
			<ol class="decimal">
				<li value="1">To start recording packets from vcan0, enter this command:
					<pre><code>kali@kali:~/ICSim$ <code class="bold">candump -l vcan0</code></code></pre>
					<p class="ListBody">The <code>-l</code> option (that’s a hyphen and a lowercase <em>L</em>) is short for <em>log</em>, because we’re asking <code>candump</code> to log its output by saving the data into a file.</p>
					</li>
				<li value="2">Switch back to the CANBus Control Panel window and drive for a few seconds. Speed up and slow down, use your left and right turn signals, and unlock and lock the doors.</li>
				<li value="3">Press <span class="KeyCaps">CTRL</span>-C to stop recording.</li>
				<li value="4">In the terminal window, enter <code class="bold">ls</code> (short for <em>list</em>) to show the contents of the <em>ICSim</em> directory. You should see a new file in the format <code>candump-</code><var>YYYY</var><code>-</code><var>MM</var><code>-</code><var>DD</var><code>_</code><var>time</var><code>.log</code> (time is defined in hours, minutes, and seconds—<var>HHMMSS</var>), such as in this example:
					<pre><code>candump-<var>2021</var><code>-</code><var>05</var><code>-</code><var>18_113713</var>.log</code></pre>
			</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				The <code>candump</code> logfile is a simple text file. You can view the file in a text editor and use <span class="KeyCaps">CTRL</span>-F to find specific CAN ID values, like 188 for the turn signals, as shown in <a href="#figure10-4" id="figureanchor10-4">Figure 10-4</a>.</p>

			<h3 id="h2-502000c10-0003"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_132" title="132"/>Replaying Packets</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">By resending the packets we captured in the logfile on the vcan0 network, we can make the dashboard “relive” the recorded driving session. This kind of hack is called a <em>replay attack</em>.</p>
			<ol class="decimal">
				<li value="1">First, close the CANBus Control Panel. The controller window sends signals constantly even when idle, and we want to use only the packets we’ve captured to control the dashboard.</li>
				<li value="2">Enter the following command into the terminal window to replay the logfile with the <code>canplayer</code> tool, replacing <code>candump-</code><var>YYYY</var><code>-</code><var>MM</var><code>-</code><var>DD</var><code>_</code><var>time</var><code>.log</code> with your logfile name:
					<pre><code>kali@kali:~/ICSim$ <code class="bold">canplayer -I candump-</code><var class="bold">YYYY</var><code class="bold">-</code><var class="bold">MM</var><code class="bold">-</code><var class="bold">DD</var><code class="bold">_</code><var class="bold">time</var><code class="bold">.log</code></code></pre>
			</li>
				<li value="3">Your ICSim dashboard should begin moving exactly the same way it did when you captured the packets originally. In <a href="#figure10-5" id="figureanchor10-5">Figure 10-5</a>, for example, I’m turning right and unlocking all four doors while driving over 90 miles per hour! (I don’t recommend doing this in your real car.)</li>
			</ol>

				<figcaption>
					<p><a id="figure10-5">Figure 10-5</a>: The replayed packets are controlling the dashboard.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Many IoT devices are vulnerable to replay attacks like this one. For example, when they first came out, many Bluetooth door locks were subject to such attacks. With a laptop running a Bluetooth wireless sniffer (like Kismet, which is included with Kali) and a physical Bluetooth antenna (like the Ubertooth One for around $100), you could capture packets while someone was opening the door with their smartphone and replay those packets to unlock the door anytime you wanted. Nowadays, to prevent replay attacks, a special value is added to each message so the system can tell whether it’s receiving a new message or one it’s seen before.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-502000c10-0004">Sending New Commands</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Car hackers can analyze <code>candump</code> logfiles to decipher CAN ID numbers and figure out what the data values in each message mean. Armed with that knowledge, hackers can send specific commands to the system to make the car do what they want. For example, sending the message <code>02000000</code> to ID# 188 turns on the right turn signal. Let’s try it out!</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_133" title="133"/>Enter the following command into the terminal with ICSim open and the controller window closed:</p>
			<pre><code>kali@kali:~/ICSim$ <b>cansend vcan0 188#02000000</b></code></pre>
			<p>
				We use <code>cansend</code> to send a CAN message to vcan0. The message contains the ID number of the turn signals (<code>188</code>), then the hash mark (<code>#</code>) as a separator, and finally the data value that represents the right turn signal  (<code>02000000</code>). The right turn signal on your dashboard should light up green.</p>
			<p>If you want to turn on the left signal instead, send this message:</p>
			<pre><code>kali@kali:~/ICSim$ <b>cansend vcan0 188#01000000</b></code></pre>
			<p>
				To turn off the signals, send the message <code class="bold">188#00000000</code>. Or use this command to turn <em>on</em> both signals at the same time:</p>
			<pre><code>kali@kali:~/ICSim$ <b>cansend vcan0 188#03000000</b></code></pre>
			<p>
				Now take a look at the data values in CAN packets related to the speedometer (ID# 244) in your <code>candump</code> logfile. It looks like the last four hexadecimal digits go up as the speed increases. The data value <code>0000000000</code> is 0 miles per hour, and <code>0000003894</code> corresponds to about 90 miles per hour. Let’s see what the value <code>0000009999</code> would do:</p>
			<pre><code>kali@kali:~/ICSim$ <b>cansend vcan0 244#0000009999</b></code></pre>
			<p>
				As you can see in <a href="#figure10-6" id="figureanchor10-6">Figure 10-6</a>, the speedometer jumps to 240 miles per hour! You can go even higher using hexadecimal—try changing the last four digits to <code>A000</code>, <code>B000</code>, or even <code>FFFF</code>.</p>
			<figure>
				<img alt="f10006" class="" src="image_fi/502000c10/f10006.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p><a id="figure10-6">Figure 10-6</a>: We can control the dashboard by sending signals directly to the CAN bus using <span class="LiteralInCaption"><code>cansend</code></span>.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Similarly, we can lock all the doors by sending the message <code>19B#00000F000000</code> and unlock all the doors with the message <code>19B#000000000000</code> (that’s 12 zeros after the hash mark):</p>
			<pre><code>kali@kali:~/ICSim$ <b>cansend vcan0 19B#00000F000000</b> kali@kali:~/ICSim$ <b>cansend vcan0 19B#000000000000</b></code></pre>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_134" title="134"/>Our virtual car thinks it’s turning both left and right and unlocking all four doors while zipping around at 240 miles per hour!</p>
			<h2 id="h1-502000c10-0004">How Attackers Hack Real Cars</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">To use the same <code>can-utils</code> tools and skills you just learned about to hack a real car, all an attacker needs is a laptop running Kali Linux and a cable to connect the laptop to the <em>on-board diagnostic, version two (OBD-II)</em> port, located under the steering wheel in most cars. Many such cables are available for under $100. However, real-world car hacking is a serious matter that can lead to significant property damage or injury. Researchers practice car hacking in controlled conditions to look for security vulnerabilities. If you practice car hacking, be sure to do it safely in your garage or driveway or on a closed course; never hack a car on the road or anywhere someone could get hurt.</p>
			<p>Car hackers don’t always have to maintain a wired connection with a vehicle to send commands. After finding useful CAN ID numbers and messages by connecting directly to a particular make and model of car, an attacker or security researcher could attempt to connect to the car wirelessly via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or 4G/5G to try to send CAN messages remotely. One high-profile hack used the driver’s hands-free smartphone connection to take remote control of the car through the car’s dashboard entertainment system. Another used Tesla’s 4G wireless over-the-air update system to install malicious software and tamper with the car from far away.</p>
			<p>One piece of good news is that every car is slightly different, and the CAN ID numbers in one car usually aren’t the same as the CAN IDs in another car. Every manufacturer uses different codes, and sometimes every model from the same manufacturer uses a different set of codes, and those codes can change from one model year to the next! Plus, there are several different types of controller networks on modern cars; the CAN is just the most common one. In short, it takes a lot of patience to crack the codes on a real car.</p>

			<h2 id="h1-502000c10-0005">The Takeaway</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">In this chapter, we used ICSim and <code>can-utils</code> to hack a virtual car network. We set up these tools on our Kali virtual machine. Then we sniffed network traffic with <code>cansniffer</code> to see what CAN data looks like. We captured CAN signals using <code>candump</code>, and then we replayed those packets using <code>canplayer</code> to change the dashboard without using the car’s keyboard controls. We also sent specific CAN messages using <code>cansend</code> to use the turn signals, change the speedometer, and unlock the doors directly from the command line. Finally, we learned that it takes only about $100 worth of tools and a lot of patience to hack a real car.</p>

    into projects, and initiating auto analysis. Once Ghidra’s initial analysis phase
    is complete, it is time for you to take control. As discussed in [Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml#ch04),
    when you launch Ghidra, your adventure starts in the Ghidra Project window. When
    you open a file within one of your projects, a second window opens. This is the
    Ghidra CodeBrowser, and it’s your home base for much of your SRE efforts. You’ve
    already used the CodeBrowser to auto analyze your file; now we’ll take a deeper
    dive into the CodeBrowser menu, windows, and basic options to increase your awareness
    of Ghidra’s capabilities and allow you to create an SRE analysis environment that
    is consistent with your personal workflow. Let’s begin with the principal Ghidra
    data displays.

    a file for analysis, we are opening an empty instance so that the functionality
    and configuration options can be demonstrated without specific file-related content
    influencing the display, as shown in [Figure 5-1](ch05.xhtml#fig5_1). In its default
    configuration, CodeBrowser has six subwindows. Before we get into the details
    associated with each of these displays, let’s spend a little time looking at the
    CodeBrowser menu and its associated functionality.

    a tool tip that displays the start and end address of the flow along with the

    in the disassembly. For example, an instruction at address A jumping to an instruction
    at address B would result in the creation of a cross-reference from A to B. Hovering
    over a reference address causes a reference pop-up to appear with the referencing
    location. The reference pop-up is in the same layout as the Listing window but
    has a yellow background (similar to a tool tip pop-up). The pop-up window allows
    you to view the content but does not allow you to follow the references. Cross-references

    as you mouse over them to indicate direction. Basic blocks that terminate with
    a conditional jump generate two possible flows: the *Yes edge* arrow (yes, the
    tested condition was met) is green by default, and the *No edge* arrow (no, the
    tested condition was not met) is red by default. Basic blocks that terminate with
    only one potential successor block use a *Normal edge* (blue by default) to point
    to the next block to be executed. You can click any arrow to see the associated
    transition from one block to another. Since the graph and listing tools are synchronized
    by default, your file location will generally remain consistent when switching

    As part of the loading process, the loader utilizes various algorithms, including
    file structure analysis and byte sequence matching to infer the compiler that
    was used to create the file. During the analysis phase, the *Function ID* analyzer
    utilizes the compiler identification information to perform hash-based function
    body matching in order to identify the presence of library function bodies that
    may have been linked into the binary. When a hash match is made, Ghidra retrieves
    the matched function’s name from the hash database (contained in Ghidra *.fidbf*
    files) and adds the name as a function symbol. Hash matching is particularly useful
    on stripped binaries, as it provides a means of symbol recovery that is independent
    of the presence of a symbol table. This functionality is discussed in more depth

- en: Decompilation is an extraordinarily complicated process, and decompiler theory
    remains an active research area. Unlike disassembly, whose accuracy can be verified
    against manufacturers’ reference manuals, there are no reference manuals that
    provide canonical translations of assembly language back to C (or C to assembly
    for that matter). In fact, while Ghidra’s decompiler always generates C source
    code, it may be the case that the binary the decompiler is analyzing was originally
    written in a language other than C, and many of the decompiler’s C-oriented assumptions
    may not hold at all.

- en: As with most complex plugins, the decompiler has idiosyncrasies, and the quality
    of its output depends, to a large extent, on the quality of its input. Many of
    the issues and irregularities in the Decompiler window can be traced back to issues
    with the underlying disassembly, so if the decompiled code doesn’t make sense,
    you may need to spend time improving the quality of the disassembly. In most cases,
    this involves annotating the disassembly with more accurate data type information,
    which is discussed in [Chapters 8](ch08.xhtml#ch08) and [13](ch13.xhtml#ch13).
    We continue to explore the decompiler’s capabilities in subsequent chapters and
    discuss it in depth in [Chapter 19](ch19.xhtml#ch19).

    By default, the Bytes window opens on the upper-right side of the CodeBrowser

    per line. The window doubles as a hex editor and can be configured to display
    a variety of formats by using the Settings tool in the Bytes window toolbar. In
    many cases, it might be helpful to add the ASCII display to the Bytes window,
    as shown in [Figure 5-19](ch05.xhtml#fig5_19). The figure also shows the Byte

    using the Snapshot icon (see [Figure 5-19](ch05.xhtml#fig5_19)) in the Bytes window
    toolbar. By default, the first Bytes window has a connection to the Listing window,
    so scrolling in one window and clicking an element causes the other window to
    scroll to the same location (same virtual address). Subsequent Bytes windows are
    disconnected, which allows you to scroll through them independently. When a window
    is disconnected, the window name appears within square brackets in the window
    title bar.

    Version\Run"` listed and wonder why an application is referencing this particular
    key within the Windows registry, and then discover that the program is setting
    that registry key to automatically start itself when Windows boots.

    a single click on a location in the Symbol Table window causes a related move

    Symbol Table location entry will immediately jump the Listing view to display
    the selected entry. This provides a useful tool for rapidly navigating to known

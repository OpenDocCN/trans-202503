    to attend such an interview due to the various signaling steps, proxy prerequisites,
    and human resource checkboxes that may erroneously screen them out. We explore
    these hiring processes in terms of why they may not achieve the desired outcome.

    enough people—and the right people—to perform all the necessary work. While part
    of this stems from the fact that cybersecurity is a relatively new field with
    a high technical barrier to entry, current candidate assessment methods are also
    problematic. Too many private-sector companies place too much value on recruiting
    candidates who check the right résumé boxes or do well on whiteboard puzzles,
    but cannot perform the job’s day-to-day functions. Candidates, recruiters, and
    training programs have noted what it takes to get a job and are positioning themselves
    accordingly, lessening the effectiveness of traditional methods of candidate evaluation.
    Universities churn out computer science graduates who cannot solve the FizzBuzz
    problem, designed to test basic programming skills. Candidates provide potential
    employers with biased or made-up references. Employees pursue meaningless job
    titles that look good on a résumé but rarely correlate with their work experience
    or capabilities. Career climbers attain IT or security certifications by cramming
    for tests (and often forget that information almost immediately); publish shallow,
    pointless articles for the visibility; and file for patents by adding their names
    to projects they had almost nothing to do with.

  zh: 网络安全行业的爆炸性增长导致了招聘足够人员——尤其是合适人员——以完成所有必要工作的难题。虽然其中一部分原因是因为网络安全是一个相对较新的领域，且具有较高的技术入门门槛，但目前的候选人评估方法同样存在问题。许多私营企业过于重视招聘那些履历上符合条件或在白板题目上表现出色的候选人，但这些人却无法执行工作中的日常任务。候选人、招聘人员和培训项目都已经了解了如何获得工作机会，并据此调整自己，从而削弱了传统候选人评估方法的有效性。大学不断培养出无法解决FizzBuzz问题的计算机科学毕业生，而这个问题的设计就是为了测试基本的编程技能。候选人向潜在雇主提供偏颇或编造的推荐信。员工追求那些在简历上看起来很吸引人的无意义职位头衔，但这些职位头衔与他们的工作经验或能力很少相关。职场晋升者通过死记硬背考试获得IT或安全认证（通常很快就会忘记这些信息）；为提高知名度而发布肤浅、无意义的文章；并通过将自己的名字添加到几乎与自己无关的项目上申请专利。

    companies for numerous reasons, including the obscurity of the highly technical
    profession, the evolution of technology, leadership’s lack of awareness or exposure
    to an employee’s more advanced capabilities, and the importance of nondemarcated
    creativity to success. To perform well and influence organizational security,
    employees need leadership buy-in and the green light to exercise their skills
    without fear of punishment or outright sabotage of their abilities.

    assesses recruits’ learning potential, aptitude, and general technical ability.
    The scores are used to assign candidates to occupational specialties in which
    they are likely to thrive if successfully trained. The ASVAB has been highly effective
    for the military, but it’s worth noting that certain cyber jobs have reported
    unexpectedly high rates of training failure and poor field performance, likely
    due to the jobs’ demanding attributes that the ASVAB does not always test for.
    In the structured world of the military, it can be difficult to identify or train
    people who want to approach challenges with creative, fearless, independent, problem
    solving–based thinking—a skill set closely associated with hackers.

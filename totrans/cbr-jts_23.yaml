    Nepotism might have been a problem as well. While one’s chances of becoming a
    successful shinobi might increase with the early expectations, opportunities,
    and grooming that came with being born into a shinobi village (most notably Iga
    and Koka), being born to shinobi parents did not guarantee success. Such children
    could, in fact, become low-quality candidates who possessed any number of the
    negative qualities mentioned above.^([4](b01.xhtml#endnote-170))

    be usefully adapted for interviewing recruits.

    their answers; such flattery makes you seem less intelligent and seems to demonstrate
    awe in the candidate’s abilities. Done convincingly, this technique loosens up
    your target, boosts their confidence, and makes them enjoy telling you about themselves,
    which could lead to all manner of valuable intelligence. For instance, once they’re
    comfortable, you can change conversational topics and see how they react to unexpected
    inquiries. Do they have their own opinions, or are they simply parroting other
    people’s wisdom?^([6](b01.xhtml#endnote-172))

    for shinobi. They often had to decide whether to entrust a person with their life
    or whether that person would let them down during a perilous mission. As a result,
    shinobi likely internalized these techniques and other rubrics to become expert
    people readers, able to quickly and unobtrusively size up someone’s capability,
    knowledge, and character.^([7](b01.xhtml#endnote-173))

    and identify opportunities to incorporate the wisdom of the shinobi into recruiting
    and training talent. Many hiring managers and even the historical shinobi seem
    to believe that they can assess the suitability of a person after a thorough interview.
    While this may work some of the time, many candidates never get the opportunity
    to attend such an interview due to the various signaling steps, proxy prerequisites,
    and human resource checkboxes that may erroneously screen them out. We explore
    these hiring processes in terms of why they may not achieve the desired outcome.

- en: The explosive growth of the cybersecurity sector has led to problems recruiting
    enough people—and the right people—to perform all the necessary work. While part
    of this stems from the fact that cybersecurity is a relatively new field with
    a high technical barrier to entry, current candidate assessment methods are also
    problematic. Too many private-sector companies place too much value on recruiting
    candidates who check the right résumé boxes or do well on whiteboard puzzles,
    but cannot perform the job’s day-to-day functions. Candidates, recruiters, and
    training programs have noted what it takes to get a job and are positioning themselves
    accordingly, lessening the effectiveness of traditional methods of candidate evaluation.
    Universities churn out computer science graduates who cannot solve the FizzBuzz
    problem, designed to test basic programming skills. Candidates provide potential
    employers with biased or made-up references. Employees pursue meaningless job
    titles that look good on a résumé but rarely correlate with their work experience
    or capabilities. Career climbers attain IT or security certifications by cramming
    for tests (and often forget that information almost immediately); publish shallow,
    pointless articles for the visibility; and file for patents by adding their names
    to projects they had almost nothing to do with.
  prefs: []

- en: Measures to combat these hiring loopholes, such as take-home tests, are easily
    bypassed with online help or outright plagiarism. On-the-spot interview whiteboard
    puzzles, while once novel, are now routine. Candidates come in having practiced
    for them and may have even gotten the exact exercises from leaks at the company.
    Even if they weren’t easily compromised, none of these assessments accurately
    gauge a candidate’s ability to do the work of cybersecurity.

- en: To be fair, candidates have just as much reason to be suspicious of cybersecurity
    employers. Even if an organization hires an incredible professional worthy of
    the title “cyber ninja,” there is no guarantee that the employer will use them
    effectively. While this risk exists in any industry, it’s compounded for cybersecurity
    companies for numerous reasons, including the obscurity of the highly technical
    profession, the evolution of technology, leadership’s lack of awareness or exposure
    to an employee’s more advanced capabilities, and the importance of nondemarcated
    creativity to success. To perform well and influence organizational security,
    employees need leadership buy-in and the green light to exercise their skills
    without fear of punishment or outright sabotage of their abilities.

    is the US military, who can take nearly computer-illiterate high school dropouts
    and, over the span of 18 months, train them to become capable cyber warfare specialists.
    Of course, not every recruit makes it through the training, as multiple layers
    of requirements filter out poor candidates—a practice that aligns closely with
    those described for shinobi recruits in *Bansenshūkai*.^([8](b01.xhtml#endnote-174))

    Aptitude Battery test (ASVAB).^([9](b01.xhtml#endnote-175)) Unlike corporate recruiting,
    which emphasizes past accomplishments and professional credentials, the ASVAB
    assesses recruits’ learning potential, aptitude, and general technical ability.
    The scores are used to assign candidates to occupational specialties in which
    they are likely to thrive if successfully trained. The ASVAB has been highly effective
    for the military, but it’s worth noting that certain cyber jobs have reported
    unexpectedly high rates of training failure and poor field performance, likely
    due to the jobs’ demanding attributes that the ASVAB does not always test for.
    In the structured world of the military, it can be difficult to identify or train
    people who want to approach challenges with creative, fearless, independent, problem
    solving–based thinking—a skill set closely associated with hackers.

    talent themselves or compete against other organizations for the limited supply
    of experienced cybersecurity experts. Many of the recommendations below are suited
    for developing talent but may be suitable for a hybrid approach as well. Many
    cybersecurity professionals may agree that current hiring practices are broken

    consider the below approaches to hiring and maintaining talent.

    quizzes, random whiteboard puzzles, live coding exercises, or take-home projects,
    ask candidates to perform functions of the actual job for which they are being
    evaluated. Have them audition in the same environment and conditions they will
    work in if hired. Test and validate assessments by giving the exercises to current
    employees and reviewing the results, measuring the correlation between performance
    on the test and actual job performance. Keep the assessments modular and regularly
    alter them so candidates cannot benefit from obtaining a leaked exercise or coaching.
    Regularly integrate recent challenges your employees have faced to keep the test
    current with the demands of the job. Ideally, the assessment should be able to
    determine an applicant’s competence in 30 minutes or less, with time enough for
    the candidate to learn through online research and/or rapid trial and error.'

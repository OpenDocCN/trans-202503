<p class="chapterintro">Just as the Batch universe revolves around the all-important <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_1">for</span> command, so does this book. <span class="xref1"><a href="part1.xhtml" class="calibre4">Part I</a></span> will explore the essentials of the scripting language, not the basics, because there’s nothing basic about Batch syntax. You’ll be able to code many Batch solutions by its completion, but chapter by chapter, you’ll feel the gravitational pull of the <span class="sans_thesansmonocd_w5regular_1">for</span> command in <span class="xref1"><a href="part2.xhtml" class="calibre4">Part II</a></span>.</p>
<p class="tx">In this part, you’ll learn about variables, scope, and data types such as strings, integers, and even floats and booleans. I’ll also discuss files, directories, and how to call programs, internal routines, and other bat files. You’ll learn about techniques such as piping and escaping, how to build an interactive Batch user interface, and much more.</p>

    to build. The developer builds the design, but the built design differs from the
    mock-up by something arbitrary like two pixels!

    basically the same.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here’s the thing — small pixel differences really do matter, especially when
    it comes to elements on a page. If one element is close to but not completely
    lined up with another element, it can create a tiny bit of unevenness, and that
    little bit of chaos leads to a feeling of unease and clutter (**[FIGURE 2-2](ch02.xhtml#ch2fig2)**).

- en: The easiest way to make sure that elements line up with one another is to add
    a grid to our design. A grid adds an invisible skeleton to our app, a scaffolding
    that we can use to set up and arrange our elements so the overall layout looks
    tidy and ordered. Aligning elements to an underlying grid will help you achieve
    alignment and consistency throughout your design.

    main *columns* to organize a large amount of information. The spaces between the
    columns highlighted in red are *gutters.* Objects in your grid can span multiple
    columns, and some objects might break out of the grid, but everything more or
    less adheres to the grid.

    To be completely correct, a typeface is a “family,” or collection of fonts. *Arial*
    is a typeface, and *Arial Bold* is a font. That said, the two terms are frequently
    used interchangeably (unless you’re a typographer), and we’ll be doing so here.

    uses a serif font (Tisa Pro), while the headlines use a sans-serif font (literally
    *without* serif — and Tisa Sans Pro is the headline font here) **([FIGURE 2-20](ch02.xhtml#ch2fig20))**.

    end up hindering readability (though, with the advent of newer and crisper screens,
    this distinction is going away).

    of clutter. The space between lines of text in a paragraph is known in typography-land
    as “leading” (from the strips of lead that typographers added between the lines
    of text when they hand-set type into the printing press). In CSS the same concept
    is referred to as “line height” **([FIGURE 2-22](ch02.xhtml#ch2fig22)).**
  prefs: []

    lines of text are too close or too far apart. Give lines of text a little space
    to improve readability and reduce the feeling of clutter, but not so much that
    they become hard to read. 1.6 is a good starting ratio (e.g., 12px font size with
    19.2px line height, 14px font size with 22.4px line height). Feel free to play
    around with your spacing to find what feels right for your specific situation.

    whereas kerning affects only a pair of letters). As with leading, we don’t want
    too much or too little. Thankfully, the defaults set for us when text is displayed
    in browsers are fairly ideal, but CSS allows you to adjust the amount of spacing
    between letters using the letterspacing property. Graphics programs also allow
    you to tinker with kerning. Large headlines sometimes look nicer with some space

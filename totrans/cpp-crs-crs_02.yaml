    Language. [Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml#ch01) sets up a working environment and bootstraps
    some language constructs, including the basics of objects, the primary abstraction
    you use to program C++.'

- en: The next five chapters examine objects and types—the heart and soul of C++.
    Unlike some other programming books, you won’t be building web servers or launching
    rocket ships from the get-go. All the programs in [Part I](part01.xhtml#part01)
    simply print to the command line. The focus is on building your mental model of
    the language instead of instant gratification.

- en: Armed with a foundation in C++’s object model, you’ll be ready to dive into
    [Chapters 7](ch07.xhtml#ch07) through [9](ch09.xhtml#ch09). These chapters present
    expressions, statements, and functions, which you use to get work done in the
    language. It might seem odd that these language constructs appear at the end of
    [Part I](part01.xhtml#part01), but without a strong knowledge of objects and their
    life cycles, all but the most basic features of these language constructs would
    be impossible to understand.

    To make it approachable, [Part I](part01.xhtml#part01) is sequential, cohesive,
    and meant to be read like a story.

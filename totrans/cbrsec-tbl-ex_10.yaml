    failings in the physical world. In fact, a threat actor who breaches the physical
    security of a building can cause just as much damage, if not more, as an attacker
    compromising the information technology network from abroad.

    breakdowns would have enabled Ajay to steal intellectual property. Executive management
    wants to make changes so this does not happen again.

    lead in addressing it? If so, who? Perhaps audit or risk management?

    about information technology processes. This means they are capable of covering
    their tracks by deleting logs. (Also, if the departure of such an employee would
    cause significant hardships, discuss during the exercise the possibility of making
    some employee tasks redundant to ensure that power and knowledge don’t reside
    solely with one person.)

    determine whether the content is malicious. Endpoint agents use it to assess many
    different data types, such as files and memory streams, based on a set of rules
    that the vendor defines and updates. This component, which we’ll refer to as the
    *scanner* for simplicity’s sake, is one of the oldest and best-studied areas in
    security from both the defensive and offensive angles.

    scanner from another (barring major performance differences or other technical
    capabilities). And on the offensive side, it’s the scanner rules rather than the
    implementation of the scanner itself that adversaries must evade.

    Bernd Fix developed some of the first antivirus software, in 1987, to neutralize
    the Vienna virus, but it wasn’t until 1991 that the world saw an antivirus scanning
    engine that resembles the ones in use today; FRISK Software’s F-PROT antivirus
    would scan a binary to detect any reordering of its sections, a pattern that malware
    developers of the time commonly employed to jump execution to the end of the file,
    where they had placed malicious code.

    for many companies. To meet this demand, vendors such as Symantec, McAfee, Kaspersky,
    and F-Secure brought their scanners to market in the 1990s. Regulatory bodies
    began enforcing the use of antivirus to protect systems, further promoting their
    adoption. By the 2010s, it was nearly impossible to find an enterprise environment
    without antivirus software deployed on most of its endpoints.

    Veil, which opened many people’s eyes to this overreliance on antivirus scanners.
    Veil’s entire purpose was to create payloads that bypassed antivirus by employing
    techniques that broke legacy detection rulesets. These techniques included string-
    and variable-name obfuscation, less common code-injection methods, and payload
    encryption. During offensive security engagements, they proved that their tool
    could effectively evade detection, causing many companies to reevaluate the value
    of the antivirus scanners they paid for. Simultaneously, antivirus vendors began
    rethinking how to approach the problem of detection.

    the same problem, these tools undoubtedly moved the needle, leading to the creation
    of more robust endpoint detection solutions. These newer solutions still make

- en: At the heart of every scanner is a set of rules that the engine uses to assess
    the content to be scanned. These rules more closely resemble dictionary entries
    than firewall rules; each rule contains a definition in the form of a list of
    attributes that, if identified, signals that the content should be treated as
    malicious. If the scanner detects a match for a rule, it will take some predetermined
    action, such as quarantining the file, killing the process, or alerting the user.

    of a piece of malware. These features can be specific, like the names or cryptographic
    hashes of files, or they can be broader, such as DLLs or functions that the malware
    imports or a series of opcodes that serve some critical function.

    the scanner. Sometimes other groups even share information about the sample with
    a vendor. The rules can also target malware families or techniques more generally,
    such as a known group of APIs used by ransomware, or strings like <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">bcdedit.exe</samp>,

    their product. Generally, vendors that heavily rely on rules specific to known
    malware samples will generate fewer false positives, while those that make use
    of less-specific indicators will encounter fewer false negatives. Because rulesets
    are made up of hundreds or thousands of rules, vendors can balance the ratio of
    specific to less-specific detections to meet the false-positive and false-negative
    tolerances of their customers.

    = <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">{BE EF}</samp>). Like plaintext
    strings, hexadecimal strings support modifiers that extend their functionality.
    These include wildcards, jumps, and alternatives. *Wildcards* are really just
    placeholders that say “match anything here” and are denoted with a question mark.

    the author to scope their search even further. For example, the string <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">{BE

- en: When trying to evade detection by a file-based scanner such as YARA, attackers
    typically attempt to generate false negatives. In short, if they can figure out
    what rules the scanner is employing to detect some relevant file (or at least
    make a satisfactory guess at this), they can potentially modify that attribute
    to evade the rule. The more brittle the rule, the easier it is to evade. In [Listing
    9-4](#list9-4), we use dnSpy, a tool for decompiling and modifying .NET assemblies,
    to change the GUID in the compiled SafetyKatz assembly so that it evades the brittle
    YARA rule shown earlier in this chapter.

- en: This simple evasion highlights the importance of building detections based on
    a sample’s immutable attributes (or at least those that are more difficult to
    modify) to compensate for the more brittle rules. This is not to discount the
    value of these brittle rules, which could detect off-the-shelf Mimikatz, a tool
    very rarely used for legitimate purposes. However, adding a more robust companion
    (one whose false-positive rate is higher and false-negative rate is lower) fortifies
    the scanner’s ability to detect samples that have been modified to evade the existing
    rules. [Listing 9-5](#list9-5) shows an example of this using SafetyKatz.

    further modify the attributes from which we’ve built the detection, such as by
    moving from P/Invoke, the native way of calling unmanaged code from .NET, to D/Invoke,
    an alternative to P/Invoke that performs the same function, avoiding the suspicious
    P/Invokes that an EDR may be monitoring for. They could also use syscall delegates
    or modify the embedded copy of Mimikatz such that the first 32 bytes of its encoded
    representation differ from that in the rule.

- en: There is one other way to avoid detection by scanners. In modern red teaming,
    most adversaries avoid touching disk (writing files to the filesystem). If they
    can operate entirely in memory, file-based scanners no longer pose a concern.
    For example, consider the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">/ticket:base64</samp>
    command line option in Rubeus, a tool for interacting with Kerberos. By using
    this flag, attackers can prevent a Kerberos ticket from being written to the target’s
    filesystem and instead have it returned through console output.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In some situations, attackers can’t avoid writing files to disk, such as in
    the case of SafetyKatz’s use of <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">dbghelp!MiniDumpWriteDump()</samp>,
    which requires the memory dump to be written to a file. In these situations, it’s
    important for attackers to limit the exposure of their files. This most commonly
    means immediately retrieving a copy of the files and removing them from the target,
    obscuring filenames and paths, or protecting the content of the file in some way.

- en: While potentially less sophisticated than other sensors, scanners play an important
    part in detecting malicious content on the host. This chapter covers only file-based
    scanners, but commercial projects frequently employ other types, including network-based
    and memory scanners. At an enterprise scale, scanners can also offer interesting
    metrics, such as whether a file is globally unique. They present a particular
    challenge for adversaries and serve as a great representation of evasion in general.
    You can think of them as black boxes through which adversary tooling passes; the
    adversary’s job is to modify the attributes within their control, namely the elements
    of their malware, to make it to the other end.

- en: Scanners, especially those related to antivirus engines, are one of the first
    defensive technologies many of us encounter. Though they fell out of favor due
    to the brittleness of their rulesets, they have recently regained popularity as
    a supplemental feature, employing (at times) more robust rules than other sensors
    such as minifilters and image-load callback routines. Still, evading scanners
    is an exercise in obfuscation rather than avoidance. By changing indicators, even
    simple things like static strings, an adversary can usually fly under the radar
    of most modern scanning engines.

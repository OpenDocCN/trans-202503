</blockquote>&#13;
<p class="ChapterIntro">In addition to stationing guards at gates and soldiers at watch posts, <em>Bansenshūkai</em> recommends defending a castle by placing scouts surreptitiously along roads, paths, and other approaches. The defending commander should place scouts at staggered intervals around the castle’s perimeter.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c09-noteref-64" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-64">1</a></sup> These scouts fulfilled one of three roles:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>Smelling scouts (<em>kagi</em>)</li>&#13;
<li>Listening scouts (<em>monogiki</em>)</li>&#13;
<li>Outside foot scouts (<em>togiki</em>)</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p>Smelling and listening scouts, who used trained dogs and dog handlers, placed themselves in shrouded observation posts—they couldn’t see out, but neither could the enemy see in. The scout focused intently on smelling or listening for signs of infiltration. These techniques worked especially well at night, as smelling and listening scouts did not need light to operate.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c09-noteref-65" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-65">2</a></sup></p>&#13;
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="72" id="Page_72"/>Outside foot scouts tried to catch infiltrators by conducting sweeps at the edge of enemy territory; hiding on enemy ground and monitoring movement toward their own camp; or using tripwires, noise, or even physical contact to detect intruders. <em>Bansenshūkai</em> says that <em>togiki</em> scouts should be shinobi themselves, as they must be skilled in stealth and observation, have a preternatural understanding of which direction the enemy will attack from, and be able to successfully detect and engage an enemy ninja.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c09-noteref-66" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-66">3</a></sup></p>&#13;
<p>In addition to human (and animal) scouts, <em>Bansenshūkai</em> recommends using active and passive detection techniques to identify enemy infiltrators. Actively, shinobi might lower or swing a <em>sarubi</em> (monkey-fire, or “fire on a rope”<sup class="endnote"><a id="c09-noteref-67" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-67">4</a></sup>) into or across a dark area such as a moat, trench, or the bottom of a castle wall to quickly and dynamically illuminate it, from a distance, in a way that fixed lanterns couldn’t. Passively, shinobi would build detection systems, for instance, by filling a wide but shallow trench with fine sand, then raking the sand into a complex pattern. Should an enemy bypass exterior defenses, they would leave footprints, alerting guards that the castle had been breached. Footprints in the sand might also tell an observant shinobi which direction the enemy came from and whether they had left the same way—valuable intelligence that could help neutralize an immediate threat and shore up future defenses.<sup class="endnote"><a id="c09-noteref-68" href="b01.xhtml#endnote-68">5</a></sup><sup> </sup></p>&#13;
<p>In this chapter, we will look at the different types of security sensors commonly used in networks, comparing and contrasting modern deployment with the ways shinobi historically used sensors. We will highlight sensor placement, as well as sensor countermeasure techniques, learning from the shinobi to enhance our own cybersecurity defenses. We will also propose sensors based on the sensory scouts of ancient times.    </p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-500549c09-0001">Identifying and Detecting Threats with Sensors</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">In cyber parlance, the term <em>sensor </em>encompasses a variety of detection systems and instruments. Most commonly, a sensor is a monitoring device on a tap, T-split, span, or mirror port that copies activity for observation, recording, and analysis. In one such configuration, sensors sniff and capture raw packets (PCAPs) as they cross the wire, then process and analyze them to alert security to suspicious events. Sensors can also be placed “in line,” meaning a packet travels through a device that can delay, block, or alter the packet’s information, effectively thwarting attacks rather than simply raising a red flag. Secondary sensors, such as Wi-Fi sensors, detect external or other unauthorized signals and connections, while physical security sensors, such as cameras, monitor access to sensitive data centers, <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="73" id="Page_73"/>server racks, and switch closets. In broader terms, certain software endpoint agents also act as sensors, as they collect events, actions, and activity on a host system and report back to a command and control (C2) system to analyze and raise alerts if necessary.</p>&#13;
<p>Organizations often dedicate sensors to certain types of traffic—for example, by configuring email gateway security devices for phishing attempts or spam, intrusion prevention/detection systems for network attacks, firewalls for unauthorized IPs and ports, proxies for suspicious websites, and data loss prevention systems. Sensor-based cybersecurity devices are typically installed at the main egress point of a network, typically at the demilitarized zone (DMZ). Because it is standard to place sensors as far up the network as possible to maximize the amount of traffic they see, if adversaries hide from sensors at the gateway or bypass the main egress to bridge into a network, it’s possible for them to operate within the network free from security sensor inspection.</p>&#13;
<p>Despite this security liability, most organizations are unlikely to drastically increase the number of sensors in their systems, as purchasing many additional sensors—along with the extra work to license, install, update, maintain, and monitor them all—is financially impractical. Unfortunately, many organizations simply assume that if the main egress sensor does not catch a threat, then more of the same sensor would not be more effective. This is an error in judgment that puts their systems at risk. </p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-500549c09-0002">Better Sensors</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">A major problem with sensors is that they almost always require a person to monitor them and act on the information they convey. This problem is compounded by the limitations of security sensors and available analysis platforms. Think of modern security sensors this way: a building has a number of tiny microphones and cameras scattered throughout, but these cameras and microphones are trapped inside little straws—straws that give them narrow fields of capture. Now imagine trying to piece together an active breach while only able to peer through a single straw at a time. Not only that, but each straw is building up thousands of hours of data to store, process, and analyze. This frustrating situation is often alleviated with signatures, algorithms, or machine learning—tools that can help to identify anomalies and malicious activity. However, these automated systems aren’t perfect. Often, they create false positives or create such a large flood of legitimate alerts that it can feel the same as not having sensors at all. To remedy these problems, we can take a page from the shinobi: we can identify the paths an enemy is likely to take, and we <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="74" id="Page_74"/>can hide many types of sensors along those paths to give early warning of attacks. Consider the following guidance as you consider improving the sensors in your organization:</p>&#13;
<ol class="decimal">&#13;
<li value="1"><em>Model your network and identify your weaknesses. </em>Create a network map and information flow model of your environment—one that describes every system and its purpose, how systems are connected, where information enters and leaves your network, the type of information received, what sensors (if any) inspect information, and the egress points. Identify areas that lack sensors and places you believe are properly monitored. Predict where threat actors will attempt to infiltrate your network. Keep in mind that creating a comprehensive map can take months and requires help across the entire enterprise. Your resulting map might not be perfect, but even a flawed map is better than no map at all.</li>&#13;
<li value="2"><em>Conduct red team and pen testing. </em>Contract a red team to attempt infiltration of your network. Consider a “purple team” approach to the exercise, in which your network defenders (the blue team) observe the red team in real time in the same room and can pause the exercise to ask questions. Query the security sensors before, during, and after the attack to see what they detected or reported, if anything. This information should be highly enlightening. Allow your blue team to consider how different sensor placement could have detected the red team faster and more accurately. Discuss architectural defense changes, sensor tuning, and other solutions that are suggested by the testing.</li>&#13;
<li value="3"><em>Detect and block encrypted traffic. </em>Block all encrypted traffic that cannot be intercepted and inspected by your sensors. Also, take appropriate steps to strip your machines’ ability to use unauthorized encryption. Have the red team test your ability to detect encrypted traffic attacks. Most sensors cannot inspect encrypted traffic; therefore, many organizations allow asymmetric encryption, such as elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), which cannot be broken by root certificates. Allowing unbroken encrypted traffic to leave your organization without going through DLP creates a security gap analogous to when castle guards scrutinize every bare-faced person who enters or leaves through the gate but permit anyone wearing a mask to walk through unchallenged.</li>&#13;
<li value="4"><em>Develop “smelling” and “listening” sensors. </em>Explore opportunities to create sensors that can secretly detect certain types of threat activity. For example, configure an external physical sensor that monitors a system’s CPU activity or power consumption and can <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="75" id="Page_75"/>detect unauthorized access or use—such as by a cryptocurrency miner—based on whether performance correlates with known commands or logged-in user activity.</li>&#13;
<li value="5"><em>Implement passive sensors. </em>Establish passive interfaces on switches and servers that should never be used. Also, configure sensors to detect and alert locally if an interface is activated, indicating the likely presence of an adversary on your network. Much like a shallow trench filled with sand, such systems can be built to detect lateral movement between network devices where it should not happen.</li>&#13;
<li value="6"><em>Install </em>togiki<em> sensors. </em>Place inward-facing sensors outside your network to detect infiltration. For example, with the cooperation of your ISP, configure sensors outside your network boundary to monitor inbound and outbound traffic that your other sensors might not detect. Place sensors in a T-split directly off a device working in conjunction with a host-based sensor, and then diff the devices against each other to determine whether both sensors are reporting the same activity. This approach helps identify compromised endpoint sensors and network interface drivers.</li>&#13;

<h2>Castle Theory Thought Exercise</h2>&#13;
<p class="BoxBodyFirst">Consider the scenario in which you are the ruler of a medieval castle with valuable assets inside. You have had three arson events inside your castle in the past week, though a fire watch was on standby and doused the flames before they spread. You believe the arsonist is a shinobi who has learned from your team’s responses and will perform a new attack—one that may not even involve fire. Your resources are thin, but your fire watch asks for additional staff and equipment to better respond, your architect wants to reinforce and fireproof sections of the castle, and your head of security requests more guards on the gates to catch the infiltrator.</p>&#13;
<p>How would you hide sensors to detect the arsonist or other suspicious actors inside your castle? Could you improve fire watch response time and capability while reducing the number of fire watch members, perhaps by using them as sensors rather than as responders? Where and how might you place human sensors to most effectively detect and alert others to suspicious activity? How would you rotate perimeter guards between sweeping inside and outside the castle, and how would you augment their capabilities to prevent an adversary from identifying when or where the guards are patrolling? What passive sensors could you implement to catch the arsonist?</p>&#13;

<h2 id="h1-500549c09-0004"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="77" id="Page_77"/>Debrief</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">In this chapter, we talked about smelling, hearing, and outside sensory scouts used to detect enemy shinobi in ancient Japan. We also looked at active and passive sensors that castle guards deployed to catch intruders. We then discussed various types of security sensors used today—sensors that help defenders see what’s happening on the wires around them. We covered several logistical problems around sensors such as sensor placement, false positives, and sensor management. Lastly, we talked about how to apply ancient shinobi techniques to identify intruders in networked systems. </p>&#13;
<p>Next, we will discuss the different types of bridges and ladders shinobi used to bypass castle defenses—a concept that has some importance in regard to sensors. For instance, imagine your castle is protected by a moat and you have placed all of your sensors at the drawbridge. An enemy shinobi who is able to covertly place a bridge of their own without using the drawbridge also effectively bypasses your sensors—making them useless. We’ll explore how this bridging concept is almost exactly the same in cybersecurity and how difficult it can be to address. </p>&#13;

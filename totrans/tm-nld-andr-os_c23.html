<h2 id="h1-502680c23-0001">Mike Fleming and Telephony</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">It has been said that mobile phones are not just for browsing content, playing games, and checking email and messages; some people have been known to also use them for phone calls.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c23-footnote-1" id="c23-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup> Or at least that was the theory behind the communications software that Android built for 1.0.</p>
<p>There are two important aspects of communication on a device: phone calls and messaging. Android had different teams for these features. And by “teams,” I mean there was a different person working on each.</p>
<p>To make the actual telephone part of Android’s phone platform work, the team brought in Mike Fleming. Mike knew that space already since he wrote the telephony software back at Danger.</p>
<p>Mike Fleming came to Silicon Valley in early 2000 to work for a company called Eazel, where he met Eric Fischer (who would later work on text functionality for Android). Within a year, Eazel ran out of funding and laid off nearly everyone. Andy Hertzfeld,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c23-footnote-2" id="c23-footnoteref-2">2</a></sup> one of Eazel’s founders and an engineer on the original Macintosh team, helped many of the employees find positions at either Apple or Danger.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c23-footnote-3" id="c23-footnoteref-3">3</a></sup> Mike and Eric went to Danger.</p>
<p>Danger had recently shifted its product focus to target mobile phones. Mike was brought in to make the phone application work, which the engineering manager thought would take a couple of weeks. Mike said, “We <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_226" title="226"/>discovered that it was really the entry point to a large set of industry standards and certification. So it was quite a bit more complex than expected.”</p>
<p>Mike stuck around Danger for about four years, before interviewing at Android, where he knew former Danger people. He started in November of 2005 and was given the task of making Android telephony work. At least he had a better idea of how complicated that job would be the second time around.</p>
<p>Mike had mixed feelings in taking the job. “I joined Android because I really wanted it to exist. But honestly, I didn’t really want to work on it. I had done telephony and I was kind of burnt out on it. But somebody had to bring that domain expertise. I joined Google to work on Android, but I had no intention of staying past Android 1.0. So my headspace going into the project was a little bit odd.”</p>

</figure>
<p>With the state of Android at that time, there was no shortage of other work to do in addition to telephony, so Mike took on other tasks as well. For example, he worked with Swetland to make debug logging more efficient and accessible to developers. On Android, this system is known as <em>logcat</em>, which stands for <code>cat</code>-ing<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c23-footnote-4" id="c23-footnoteref-4">4</a></sup> a logfile.</p>
<p>Mike also helped out with the Java runtime. Dan Bornstein was working on making the new Dalvik runtime work, but the team needed a placeholder to use in the meantime. Mike pulled in JamVM, an open source runtime for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_227" title="227"/>Java. This gave the team something to write Java code against and gave him enough functionality to start working on the code for the telephony software, which he finished up once Dalvik was working.</p>
<p>One of the tricky parts in the telephony work was that the G1 phone was launching with 3G connectivity, which was new for T-Mobile. Since T-Mobile was getting it to work on their network at the same time, the Android team needed a way to test it, so T-Mobile parked a dedicated 3G COW<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c23-footnote-5" id="c23-footnoteref-5">5</a></sup> on the Google campus to allow G1 users to test the new network. </p>

</figure>
<p>Although Mike made telephony work on Android, he did not work on the telephone application (also known as Dialer), although he had wanted to do just that. There were deep, architectural disagreements between the different factions of people who had worked at Danger, Be/PalmSource, and WebTV/Microsoft. Eventually, Steve Horowitz, who was running engineering, stepped in and worked out a deal that got the teams past this period of conflict and indecision. Mike remembered, “At some point there was a decision made that the Danger people would work on the lower parts of the system and the Palm and Microsoft people would work on the upper layers. I <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_228" title="228"/>think that Steve Horowitz brokered that compromise with Brian [Swetland]. I remember being unhappy with it at the time. I wasn’t bought into that. But that was the deal that was made.”</p>

</figure>
<p>This segmenting of the Danger and Be/PalmSource/Microsoft teams brought up other tensions and philosophical differences. For example, Dianne proposed a model of <em>Intents</em>, Android’s mechanism for allowing applications to launch other apps to handle specific actions, like “take a picture” bringing up a camera app, or “send an email” launching an email app. An application could register the Intents it could handle in its <em>manifest</em> (a file that is bundled along with an application that contains summary information about the app). Having the information available in the manifest file instead of just in the code of the application itself meant that the system could identify which apps handled which Intents quickly, without having to launch the apps to find out. </p>
<p>But others on the team weren’t convinced. Wei Huang said, “At the time, we’re like, ‘Why are we making this so complicated?’ I remember Chris DeSalvo and Mike Fleming were advocating making it simple: just do it when an app is running. There were a few things where I think Dianne had a much more of an in-depth idea how things would scale on the platform. But <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_229" title="229"/>at the same time, I think that the activity lifecycle<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c23-footnote-6" id="c23-footnoteref-6">6</a></sup> was kind of complicated. And Swetland was very frustrated with how complicated things were.”</p>
<p>Mike Fleming added, “I think that there was never really a forum for discussing an alternative to Activities and Intents. I think that that was probably the thing that I was the most upset with. As someone who’s working on the lower layer, because I happened to have the domain expertise, but also had participated on doing the upper layer at previous companies, I was really upset that I wasn’t able to be a part of the whole vision.”</p>
<p>Wei Huang observed, “These people had a lot of experience in building mobile OSes. It was not without challenges; we had to figure out how to work with each other, because we had different opinions. And strong opinions. Overall, I think we managed to work through these differences. Not all of them, because Mike Fleming left.”</p>
<p>In the Spring of 2008, six months before 1.0, Mike left Android. He said, “The product was struggling to come together. I felt that it was entirely possible that it would not make it out the door. It didn’t work very well on devices. It was slow and crashed a lot. It worked well enough to use, but I found it to be a very frustrating and disappointing product.</p>
<p>“The telephony stuff was in good hands. The Dalvik stuff was in good hands. And I felt that I didn’t have anything else that I could do to help it ship. I didn’t expect to stay beyond completion. I didn’t see what I could do to really help complete it. So I left for a startup.”</p>
<p>Despite Mike’s feelings about Android at the time, he had gotten telephony working before he left, and the product continued on its long journey toward 1.0.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c23-0002">Wei Huang and Messaging</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Users of recent Android releases may wonder at the many messaging applications Google has provided recently, but Android has always had many of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_230" title="230"/>these apps. To some extent, this dynamic is a product of there being so many different kinds of messaging: SMS (text messaging through the carrier), MMS (texting pictures or groups of friends), Instant Messaging (of various flavors), video chat, and so on. Even in the early days, there were multiple ways of messaging people, most using different underlying protocols and requiring different apps, but there was only one engineer working on all of them: Wei Huang.</p>
<p>In the Spring of 2006, Wei was on the Android Browser team, but after many years of working on browsers (at Microsoft, then AvantGo, then Danger, then Android), he was ready for something new. Steve Horowitz suggested that he take on messaging, since Android needed it and nobody else was on it. So Wei worked on the Google Talk application as well as SMS.</p>
<p>Owning both of these apps seems like a lot of work for a single engineer (and, indeed, multiple teams of multiple people are working on equivalent apps now). In fact, the underlying mechanisms for these apps to work was quite different, especially with the carrier requirements necessary for SMS messaging. But back in the early days of Android, this was a typical workload. Wei said, “At the time, we didn’t have the luxury of even one engineer per feature. Other people were owning one or two apps.”</p>
<p>Wei dove into Google Talk first and was able to get a demo working quickly. One of the things that helped get it going was that Google Talk (which already existed as a desktop app, with a complete backend on Google servers) used a very full-featured protocol for sending messages (XMPP<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c23-footnote-7" id="c23-footnoteref-7">7</a></sup>), so it was relatively straightforward for Wei to write an app to set up a connection to the server and send messages back and forth.</p>
<p>One of the hard parts with turning his app from a demo into a product was maintaining that connection between the server and the client. The connection would frequently drop, but the client wouldn’t find out and would continue sending messages without realizing that the messages weren’t going through. Much of the time that Wei spent on the project went into making the connection more reliable, with logic to handle the inevitable drops and retries.</p>
<p>Once the rudiments of the system were working, Michael Morrissey, who was leading the services team, suggested using this connection for all the Google apps (including Gmail, Contacts, and Calendar). Instead of each <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_231" title="231"/>of those apps having to maintain its own connection to the backend, they could all share this single, persistent connection. Software on the device would combine app data to send to the server through this single pipe and would receive responses from the server and deliver them to the appropriate applications. This was a similar architecture to the one at Danger that Michael had helped set up.</p>
<p>This connection was available not only to the existing apps; it was potentially available for pushing messages from other apps as well. Charles Mendis, for his Bounce application, wanted to be able to notify the Maps app when friends’ locations changed. With push messaging enabled over this persistent connection, the Maps server could find out when a location changed and send that to the device, which would send it to the Maps app to update locations on the screen.</p>
<p>Wei worked with Debajit on the implementation, piggy-backing all this infrastructure onto the existing Google Talk connection. They wanted to release it in 1.0 as a connection not only for Google apps, but also for any apps that wanted to use push messaging. But then they talked to the security team, who told them, “There’s no way you’re going to launch this thing.” It wasn’t secure enough.</p>
<p>So even though the functionality and API for pushing messages was available to developers in pre-1.0 releases, it was removed in the .9 release. There’s an item about it in the Android 0.9 SDK Beta release notes:<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c23-footnote-8" id="c23-footnoteref-8">8</a></sup></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p class="Blockquote"><em>Due to the security risks inherent in accepting arbitrary data from “outside” the device, the data messaging facility of the GTalkService will not be present in Android 1.0. The GTalkService will provide connectivity to Google’s servers for Google Talk instant messaging, but the API has been removed from this release while we improve the service. Note that this will be a Google-specific service and is not part of the core of Android.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This functionality made it into Android later (after the team fixed the security issues), eventually showing up in the Google Play Services library as something called Google Cloud Messaging.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c23-footnote-9" id="c23-footnoteref-9">9</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c23-0003"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_232" title="232"/>SMS</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Meanwhile, Wei was also working on getting SMS working. Most of the effort for the project was in implementing and perfecting all the complex features and requirements needed for carrier certification. He said, “It was a pain because of carriers.” </p>
<p>For a long time, Wei was working alone. But as 1.0 got closer, Android worked with engineers from Esmertec in China, especially to help with the integration of SMS and MMS and making them work correctly for carrier compliance. </p>
<p>Ficus, who had been working on camera and then audio drivers, also joined the effort to help make it work more reliably. He had a personal passion to have better messaging on Android. “I was trying to be a good Android dogfooder<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c23-footnote-10" id="c23-footnoteref-10">10</a></sup> and was texting . . . and it just didn’t work. I felt like being younger had some perspective for me that was lacking elsewhere; it was a big part of social life in the mid 2000s. I just started fixing bugs, committing code. I didn’t get any blessing to stop working on my other stuff or start on SMS, I just did it. I just felt that someone should fix it.”</p>
<p>Another person helping out was Peisun Wu,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c23-footnote-11" id="c23-footnoteref-11">11</a></sup> who was managing the project (in addition to other projects on Android). With everything from external contractors to carrier testing, there were many details to be managed.</p>
<p>Carrier testing complicated communications projects like these. Ficus explained: “There was a lot of carrier compliance certification stuff, which made me crazy. The MMS standard in particular is really complex. There are all these things you can do with it, making slideshows and images doing animations and playing sounds. And even though everyone knew that the only thing anyone ever actually wanted to do was send one and only one picture, you had to implement the whole thing because you had to go through carrier certification.”</p>
<p>In June of 2008, Ficus, Wei, and Peisun flew over to China to work with the contractors. Sichuan had just had a major earthquake, so they met in Beijing and worked out of the Google office for two weeks.</p>

<p>Ficus remembered a later trip to work with the same team: “Summer of 2008, trying to ship. None of the prototype devices could leave the supervision of a Google employee. All of the contractors were in Chengdu, China. We’d previously met in Beijing, but this was during the Olympics and we couldn’t get a place to meet. We had to find a place that had a GSM network, and a Google office so that we could have these test devices, and that the engineers could get a visa to. So we met in Zurich for two weeks.”</p>
<p>Both Google Talk and SMS (with MMS) made it in time for the 1.0 launch.</p>

You might think that applications are either running or not, but the reality is much more complex. For example, applications can be running in the foreground (with the user interacting with them) or running in the background (when another application is in the foreground). As applications are started, brought into the foreground, sent to the background, and eventually killed, they go through several stages of their lifecycle. The distinction between these lifecycle phases is one of the things that Android developers need to understand about their applications . . . and it’s always been one of the more complicated bits of Android to fully understand.</p></aside>

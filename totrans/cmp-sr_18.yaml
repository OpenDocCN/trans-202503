- en: You might have heard the term *free Wi-Fi* at a library, café, or hotel. This
    means that wireless internet access is being offered at no charge. If you have
    a laptop or tablet, you can connect to Wi-Fi using the following steps. You can
    also use the same process to connect to a friend or family member’s wireless internet
    connection in their home—as long as they give you the password!

    you that the network security key isn’t correct. In that case, try typing the
    password again. Note that some establishments will load an internet page requiring
    you to accept their terms of use before you can connect.

    intercepted by other people, so you should avoid using a public connection to
    access sensitives sites such as online banking.

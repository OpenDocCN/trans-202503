- en: This concludes the treeware version of *The Book of I*^(*2*)*C*. However, this
    is only the beginning of your journey toward learning how to program I²C devices.
    There are hundreds of different I²C devices in the real world, with more appearing
    all the time. No matter how many devices I describe in this book, it will eventually
    become out of date as manufacturers create new devices.

    the MCP4728 quad DAC and the Raspberry Pi Pico. That’s in addition to the many
    common devices already on the market, with boards produced by Adafruit, SparkFun,
    Seeed Studio, and others.'

- en: As discussed in the introduction, to keep the page count and cost of this book
    reasonable, I’ve chosen to move the discussion of several devices onto my website
    at [https://www.randallhyde.com/bookofi2c](https://www.randallhyde.com/bookofi2c).
    Chapters 17 and beyond of this book will appear on that site, making them easy
    to update and extend as time permits and new devices become popular. Appendix
    B in this book describes currently planned online chapters, but I intend to add
    more in the future. Please visit the website to find additional support material,
    expanded example code, and links to other information on I²C programming.

- en: Even without the online materials, this book has taught you almost everything
    you need to know to begin using I²C peripherals. At this point, you should be
    able to read through a device’s datasheet and use that information to program
    any I²C device out there. Good luck, and happy programming!

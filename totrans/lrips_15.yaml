- en: Travelling with Winsome on the *Doppelganger* was lots of fun. Laurie got to
    see so many strange places and people that sometimes she forgot she was trying
    to find her way back to Hamilton. But her job wasn’t easy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whenever they arrived at an island, Winsome would take a huge bag of letters
    into town and deliver them. She would return a few hours later with a new load
    of letters to take from that island to somewhere else.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Laurie’s job was to deliver the “interesting” packages. (Winsome kept using
    that word. Laurie didn’t think it meant what Winsome thought it meant.) “Interesting”
    customers lived in tall towers in the middle of nowhere, over shaky, scary bridges,
    on top of high hills, or on the sides of cliffs. The packages were heavy (and
    fragile . . . and expensive), and the directions for their destinations were often
    bizarre and incomplete. Just to make it there and back in one piece, Laurie had
    to be clever about her work.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unclear directions were bad enough, but this time, the package Laurie was supposed
    to deliver didn’t have a proper address at all. It just said *FIRST, FOLLOW THE
    BYZANTINE PROCESS.* Winsome had gone off somewhere, so Laurie couldn’t even ask
    her for help.
  prefs: []

    I follow it?” she wondered aloud.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of the main road. Or a river. Or a road beside the river. It’s only logical.”

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    by an enormous stone building. *All Deliveries Enter Here*, a sign read. A long
    red carpet led inside to a semantic turnstile with two guards, just like in Symbol.
    The guards seemed to be in the middle of an argument.

    the Watch—” began Anton.

    of the Watch—” said Anton.

    Senior Officer and Lieutenant Anton is the Junior.”
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    was the Thirtieth of Pentember. I think we all agree that thirty is an even number,
    and so I was the Senior Officer.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    “So Anton should be Junior today, and Basil should be Senior, right?”'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “There is the question of whether zero is even or odd,” said Basil.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Oh.” Laurie had never thought of zero that way. Now she was curious. “So which
    is it? Even or odd?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Zero is even!” said Anton. “It evenly divides by two. Zero divided by two is
    zero.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “That doesn’t prove a thing,” said Basil. “Zero divided by *any* number is zero.
    More to the point, if zero is even, then Anton would have two days in a row as
    Senior Officer, and I won’t stand for that!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Even more to the point,” said Anton, “if zero is odd, then Basil would be Senior
    both today and tomorrow, the First of Hectember. I won’t sit still for *that*!”

    on where you sit,” Basil said.
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    security!”
  prefs: []

    says you can pass, then we say you can pass,” said Anton.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '“He’s down the hall to the right,” added Basil. “Now see here, Anton: If you
    add two odd numbers together you get an even, right? And zero plus zero is zero.
    So if zero is even like you insist, then it must also be odd at the same time
    . . .”'

    *General Constantin Case, Office of Perimeter Security*. She knocked lightly and
    stepped inside the room.

    a large map of a river on his desk; the map was covered in scribbles and arrows.

    and a load of mandelbroccoli across the Concurrent Streams. The boat is only big
    enough for him and one other thing.”

  prefs: []

    Euripides in the Office of Records,” Darius said, handing back Laurie’s Form.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Euripides had his hands full with a problem of his own. People were crowded
    around huge record books lying on tables in the Office of Records. Some people
    were trying to read long strings of numbers from the books. Others wanted to *write*
    new numbers in the books. The readers and writers were thrashing about, getting
    in each other’s way. It looked like a fight could start at any time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    orders. A crowd of people followed him around, shouting over one another, trying
    to get his attention. It looked like he barely had time to think.

    General had to go break up an argument.

    came back.

    and confused. Mandelbroccoli, fence-posts, Passes, General This, General That
    . . . where did it all end? She could still hear the fighting over who got to
    use what book next.

    Of course, he was forty feet tall and had teeth as long as your arm.”

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    arguing with Ponens and Tollens outside of Symbol? I didn’t think you’d find a
    way past them. But you did. Same with that scary old lady Jane.”
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So with nothing else she could do, and nowhere else she could go, Laurie started
    to think.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She needed an Approval from Euripides so she could get one from Darius. Then,
    she needed to use *that* to get an Approval from General Case, and finally, the
    Form had to be signed and countersigned by Basil and Anton. There was something
    familiar about this Byzantine chaos. Something Hugh Rustic had told her. *Think
    of an answer, and then look for a problem that fits.*
  prefs: []

    at once. Maybe she should start there . . .

    or shove, or cut in front of anyone. She waited. Eventually one of the books became
    completely free. Laurie walked over to it and drew a line on the floor.
  prefs: []

    A few moments later, a man came up to read from the book.
  prefs: []

    customer is finished.”
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to read from page 1024.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    after me.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Laurie held the line until the pattern looked like it would keep going on its
    own. Each new person would be told to wait by the others already in line. Then
    she waited for the next book to open up.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As the idea spread, people started drawing lines of their own in front of other
    books. Soon the whole Records Office was calm and organized. After all, it was
    General’s Orders.

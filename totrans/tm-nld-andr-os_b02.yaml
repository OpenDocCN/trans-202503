- en: In the course of writing this book, I read many books, articles, docs, websites,
    and anything else that I could find that related to Android, other mobile technology,
    or just tech history in general. Here are some of the more useful and memorable
    resources I enjoyed.

    This multi-part series of articles covers every release of Android from 1.0, detailing
    the user-visible changes in apps, devices, and the UI. One of the best parts is
    all the screenshots, because you can’t even get them anymore (even if you have
    one of the old devices, chances are it doesn’t talk to the same services anymore).'

    My friend Romain and I gave this presentation several times at different developer
    events, where we talked about some of the internal details of how things were
    developed and what it looked like from the inside of the team.'

    Norbye ([https://adbackstage.libsyn.com/](https://adbackstage.libsyn.com/)): This
    is a podcast that I host with my friends and Android colleagues Romain and Tor.
    I mention it because, while it is mostly a podcast by and for developers, there
    are some episodes along the way that are more about the history of Android. In
    particular, we spoke with Ficus Kirkpatrick (episode 56), Mathias Agopian (episode
    74), Dave Burke (episode 107), and Dan Bornstein (episode 156) about some of the
    old days that I talk about in the book. My favorite part of writing this book
    was the conversations I had along the way with the people on the team; these episodes
    offer a glimpse into what some of those conversations were like.'

    Bos (Pearson, 2014): For anyone who felt that the level of technical depth about
    Android OS internals was lacking, I recommend picking up this textbook on OS design
    and digging into Chapter 10.8 on Android. That chapter was written by Dianne Hackborn
    and covers things like Binder and Linux Extensions in a satisfying level of detail
    that I felt was out of scope for a book that was already bordering on too technical
    and too long.'

    how one of the canonical pieces of Silicon Valley history came to be. It’s also
    a great look into the people and the team behind that project.'

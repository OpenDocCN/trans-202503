    Most places with an internet connection have a wireless modem or router serving
    a multitude of devices, from desktops to phones and internet of things (IoT) devices
    such as TVs, light bulbs, and refrigerators. Without wireless technology, modern
    life would be much less convenient, but convenience often forces us to give up
    some of our online security.

    expands the available address space by many orders of magnitude, but it’s not
    as common as another mitigation: network address translation (NAT), which we described
    in [Chapter 1](nsp-enoka501485-0010.xhtml#ch01). If you don’t use IPv6 in your
    network but leave it enabled, you’re providing adversaries one more potential
    *intrusion vector* (that is, another way to enter or otherwise compromise your
    network). As a general rule, you should disable or uninstall all protocols and
    applications that are not in active use to prevent attackers from using those

    when they connect to the network. These assignments are called *DHCP leases* and

    may change each time the endpoint connects or the lease expires. However, you
    can alternatively assign each endpoint its own static IP address that it’ll keep

    *192.168.1.100* to *192.168.1.105*, limiting the number of devices that can be
    assigned a DHCP address to six. When these IP addresses have been statically assigned
    to the devices within your network, no additional devices can receive an IP address
    from the DHCP server without one of those devices going offline or being removed

    the gateway to the internet. The router handles this access by allowing or disallowing
    devices connected to your guest network to see devices connected to your primary

    option and one that you should implement. If your router has this capability,

    requires an authentication server. WPA2 replaced both the RC4 encryption cipher

    mechanism. All of this made WPA2 far more secure than the earlier encryption protocols

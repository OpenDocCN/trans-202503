<p class="BodyFirst">I, Colleen, would like to thank my parents, John and Nancy, and my grandmother Irene for their support while I was writing this book and for encouraging me to play with mathematics when I was young.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank Justin Moeller for the sports and art conversations that led me into data science as a career, as well as his and Christy Moeller’s support over the long course of writing this book, and Ross Eggebeen, Mark Mayor, Matt Mayor, and Malori Mayor for their ongoing support with this project and other writing endeavors over the years.</p>
<p>My career in this field and this book would not have been possible without the support of Cynthia DeJong, John Pustejovsky, Kathleen Karrer, Dan Feaster, Willie Prado, Richard Schoen, and Ken Baker during my educational years, particularly my transition from the medical/social sciences to mathematics during medical school. I’m grateful for the support of Jay Wigdale and Michael Giske over the course of my career, as well as the support from many friends and colleagues, including Peter Wittek, Diana Kachan, Recinda Sherman, Natashia Lewis, Louis Fendji, Luke Robinson, Joseph Fustero, Uchenna Chukwu, Jay and Jenny Rooney, and Christine and Junwen Lin.</p>
<p>This book would not have been possible without our editor, Alex Freed; our managing editor, Jill Franklin; and our technical reviewer, Franck Kalala Mutombo. We both would also like to acknowledge the contributions of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xviii" title="xviii"/>Bastian Rieck and Noah Giansiracusa. We are grateful for the support of No Starch Press’s marketing team, particularly Briana Blackwell in publicizing our speaking engagements.</p>
<p>We are also grateful to R, which provided open source packages and graphics generated with code, as well as Microsoft PowerPoint, which was used with permission to generate the additional images in this book. We would also like to thank NightCafe for providing a platform to generate images and granting full rights to creators.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">No achievement in life is without the help of many known and unknown individuals. I, Yaé, would like to thank just a few who made this work possible.</p>
<p>To my wife, Owolabi, for your unwavering support. To Colleen Farrelly, for initiating this venture and taking me along. To Franck Kalala, my senior colleague and friend, for his excellent reviewer skills.</p>
<p>To my friends and colleagues: Collins A. Agyingi, David S. Attipoe, Rock S. Koffi, Evans D. Ocansey, Michael Kateregga, Mamana Mbiyavanga, Jordan F. Masakuna and Gershom Buri for the care. To Jan Groenewald and the entire AIMS-NEI family.</p>

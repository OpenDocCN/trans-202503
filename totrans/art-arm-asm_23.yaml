- en: To compile ARM assembly language source files (including those in this book)
    on your computer, you will need the Gas assembler and other tools installed. The
    assembler is part of the GNU C compiler suite, so if you install that package
    on your system, you’ll get the assembler as well. Since the installation instructions
    differ by OS, this appendix will help you locate and install the files you need
    on your machine.

    are already installed on your system, and you’re good to go. However, if either
    command complains that the file is not found (or otherwise does not print the
    help screen), skip to the section for your OS to install GCC and Gas.

- en: To write assembly code on an Apple Silicon machine (such as an M*x* class machine
    or even an iPad or iPhone), you must install Apple’s Xcode development platform
    on your Mac. Go to the Apple App Store and then locate, download, and install
    Xcode. This is a very large file (many gigabytes) and will take a while to download.
    After you run the installer, you should be able to compile the assembly code in
    this book.

- en: Technically, when installing Xcode, you’re installing Apple’s LLVM Clang compiler
    and Clang assembler, not GCC and Gas. However, these tools are mostly compatible
    with GCC and Gas (and can certainly handle all the source code appearing in this
    book). The two assemblers have occasional syntax differences, and the *aoaa.inc*
    file was created to help smooth over those differences (review the *aoaa.inc*
    source code if you are interested in seeing some of them). Various comments throughout
    this book also point out the differences between Gas and the Clang assembler (for
    example, see the discussion of the lea macro in section 3.8, “Getting the Address
    of a Memory Object,” on [page 153](chapter3.xhtml#pg_153)).

    running Debian/Ubuntu Linux or Raspberry Pi OS, enter gcc --version at the command
    line; if the shell doesn’t respond with an error but instead prints information
    on GCC, you’re all set.

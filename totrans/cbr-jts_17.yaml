    or fortification was start a fire—ideally in or around gunpowder storehouses,
    wood stores, food or supply depots, or bridges. A well-set fire spread quickly
    while staying out of sight; could not be contained or extinguished easily; and
    became an immediate danger to the castle’s integrity, supplies, and inhabitants.
    Castle defenders were forced to choose between putting out the flames and fighting
    the enemy army signaled to attack by the arsonist. Attempting to fight both battles
    at once weakened a target’s ability to do either. Those who fought the fire were
    easily overtaken by the advancing soldiers, while those who ignored the fire to
    take up arms ultimately lost the battle no matter how well they fought.^([1](b01.xhtml#endnote-111))

    tactics, and skills used to execute them. Before an attack, shinobi studied a
    castle’s inhabitants to determine when they slept or when key positions went unguarded.
    They then worked with other invaders to coordinate timing. Shinobi engineered
    numerous custom tools for these attacks, such as fire arrows, covert fire-holding
    cylinders, land mines, bombs, and throwable torches.^([2](b01.xhtml#endnote-112))
    Among the most visually dynamic weapons were “heat horses”—horses with special
    torches tied to their saddles and set loose to run wildly inside fortifications,
    spreading fire chaotically, distracting guards and inhabitants, and proving difficult
    to contain. Amid the confusion, shinobi communicated with forces concealed outside
    the castle to cue the attack once the fire had sufficiently spread.^([3](b01.xhtml#endnote-113))

    to network storage to the cloud, holding data hostage or, in the case of nonpayment,
    destroying it through encryption. Like ninja fire attacks, ransomware is often
    used to distract from bigger gambits. For example, adversaries (believed to be

    host intrusion detection systems (HIDS), and Group Policy Objects (GPO). Such

    used to secretly carry flames and weaponize fire. We looked at several high-profile
    cyberattacks, along with ways to defend against them. We also looked more generally
    at ways in which cyber threats act like the digital twin of fire attacks.

- en: One of the most impactful things a shinobi could do after infiltrating a castle
    or fortification was start a fire—ideally in or around gunpowder storehouses,
    wood stores, food or supply depots, or bridges. A well-set fire spread quickly
    while staying out of sight; could not be contained or extinguished easily; and
    became an immediate danger to the castle’s integrity, supplies, and inhabitants.
    Castle defenders were forced to choose between putting out the flames and fighting
    the enemy army signaled to attack by the arsonist. Attempting to fight both battles
    at once weakened a target’s ability to do either. Those who fought the fire were
    easily overtaken by the advancing soldiers, while those who ignored the fire to
    take up arms ultimately lost the battle no matter how well they fought.^([1](b01.xhtml#endnote-111))

    tactics, and skills used to execute them. Before an attack, shinobi studied a
    castle’s inhabitants to determine when they slept or when key positions went unguarded.
    They then worked with other invaders to coordinate timing. Shinobi engineered
    numerous custom tools for these attacks, such as fire arrows, covert fire-holding
    cylinders, land mines, bombs, and throwable torches.^([2](b01.xhtml#endnote-112))
    Among the most visually dynamic weapons were “heat horses”—horses with special
    torches tied to their saddles and set loose to run wildly inside fortifications,
    spreading fire chaotically, distracting guards and inhabitants, and proving difficult
    to contain. Amid the confusion, shinobi communicated with forces concealed outside
    the castle to cue the attack once the fire had sufficiently spread.^([3](b01.xhtml#endnote-113))

    deploying archers to shoot fire arrows, for example—*Bansenshūkai* recommends
    that commanders employ shinobi to set the fire instead. Compared to external attacks,
    fires set by shinobi would not be spotted and extinguished as quickly. Also, the
    shinobi could set them near combustible or strategically valuable items, and an
    agent could feed them until they grew.^([4](b01.xhtml#endnote-114))

    began implementing targeted countermeasures. These included fireproofing fortifications
    with *dozo-zukuri* (“fireproofing with plaster”) or fire-resistant lacquer,^([5](b01.xhtml#endnote-115))
    building with fireproof or fire-resistant materials such as clay or rock, using
    fire-resistant roof tiles, establishing fire watch teams, and creating firebreaks
    by designating inconsequential buildings (i.e., buildings that could be sacrificed
    to prevent fire from spreading to critical infrastructure).^([6](b01.xhtml#endnote-116))
    Guards were also warned that fires might be purposeful distractions to facilitate
    theft, attack, or other actions^([7](b01.xhtml#endnote-117))(advice later mirrored
    in the *Gunpo Jiyoshu* manual^([8](b01.xhtml#endnote-118))).

    that defenders kept a constant lookout for arsonists (much like modern organizations
    that maintain antivirus and threat detection everywhere). Shinobi engineered ingenious
    methods to deliver fire covertly, weaponize it, and exploit combustible targets.
    When imagining how cyberattacks could be delivered and weaponized against targets,
    keep shinobi ingenuity with fire attacks in mind.

    attacks are surprisingly similar to modern hybrid tactics. Fire is a great analogy
    for wormable/self-propagating cyberattacks, as it spreads to everything it can
    touch. We will review examples of destructive cyberattacks, as well as how modern
    adversaries time and coordinate them. We will touch on the various defenses that
    organizations use to prevent, mitigate, contain, and recover from cyberattacks.
    Takeaways from this chapter can be applied to firewalls, as well as new, more
    advanced network defense strategies.

    self-propagating viruses and worms were born. Destructive attacks have only gotten
    more prolific with time. Now, a destructive attack on one organization’s network
    can quickly spread like fire, destroying systems and data across the internet.
    Considering the growing interconnectedness of systems in cyberspace as well as
    inherent security flaws, a network or machine connected to the internet without
    patches or other safeguards is basically kindling just waiting to be lit.

    attacks, malware encrypts a system or network’s data (and deletes the backups)
    until the target pays to unencrypt them. These viruses quickly spread from systems
    to network storage to the cloud, holding data hostage or, in the case of nonpayment,
    destroying it through encryption. Like ninja fire attacks, ransomware is often
    used to distract from bigger gambits. For example, adversaries (believed to be
    North Korean) deployed the FEIB Hermes ransomware attack to divert cyber defenders’
    attention while the attackers executed the SWIFT financial attack, which netted
    them millions of dollars.^([9](b01.xhtml#endnote-119))

    attack surface by hardening systems so that when systems are attacked, fine-tuned
    security controls limit the damage. Also useful is resiliency, in which multiple
    backups of systems and data in other locations and networks give organizations
    a fallback when a cyberattack successfully compromises the primary systems. (Sometimes
    these backups are even analog or manual systems.)

    of the network. However, if an attacker bypasses them, infiltrates the network,
    and starts a self-propagating destructive attack, a firewall may let the attack
    get outside of its network; in other words, firewalls are typically designed to
    block incoming attacks, not outgoing attacks. Other efforts to detect and stop
    destructive attacks include antivirus software, intrusion prevention systems (IPS),
    host intrusion detection systems (HIDS), and Group Policy Objects (GPO). Such
    technical safeguards might immediately identify a destructive attack, respond
    to it, and neutralize it, but they are typically signature based and therefore
    not always effective.

    organization from the legal and financial fallout of a breach. While such an insurance
    policy may mitigate an organization’s liability in the case of a cyberattack,
    it does not defend against attacks, just like fire insurance does not defend against
    flames.

    network segregation and isolation (air gapping) to limit resource access and prevent
    the spread of a self-propagating virus. While this is an exceptionally effective
    way to block a cyberattack, it is not always feasible given its potentially high
    impact on business functions. Also, it can be bypassed by sneakernets and insider
    threats.

    switch that manually disconnects the organization from the internet. Internal
    intranet communications continue, but all external network connections immediately
    disconnect, creating a physical air gap. The need for this capability might seem
    extreme or unlikely, but in the event of a global “cyber fire,” the organization

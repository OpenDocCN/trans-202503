- en: The first time you run a virtual machine in VirtualBox, you might encounter
    errors due to different settings on your Mac or PC. Use this appendix to troubleshoot
    your VirtualBox setup. If you try everything listed in these steps and still have
    trouble, go to the book’s website, [https://www.nostarch.com/go-hck-yourself/](https://www.nostarch.com/go-hck-yourself/),
    for the latest help, or do a web search for the specific error you’re seeing.
    Setting up a virtual hacking lab may take a few tries, but it’s worth it!

    different BIOS, so just look for menu options that say something like “Virtualization
    Technology,” “VT-x,” or “VT-d.” These are usually under Advanced, System, or CPU
    settings.

- en: If your VM still won’t start after you’ve tried all the virtualization settings
    just discussed, and after you’ve downloaded and reinstalled the correct VirtualBox
    and VM files, your computer’s antivirus software might be blocking VirtualBox.
    Search online for whether others are encountering the same issue (my students
    have had trouble with WebRoot SecureAnywhere, as well as some versions of Avast
    and Symantec), as you might be able to add an exclusion for VirtualBox so that
    the antivirus software won’t block it. As a last resort, try using a computer
    with a different antivirus app or changing antivirus programs.

    of a browser or in a text editor ([Chapter 1](chapter1.xhtml)). Then, you’ll learn
    how to represent individual pieces of data with variables and constants, and how
    to manipulate that data through statements and expressions ([Chapter 2](chapter2.xhtml)).
    Next, you’ll see how to group individual values into more meaningful structures
    using JavaScript’s compound data types, arrays and objects ([Chapter 3](chapter3.xhtml)).'

    code. First, you’ll incorporate logic into your programs with conditionals and
    loops, which together allow you to make decisions and control the flow of code
    execution ([Chapter 4](chapter4.xhtml)). Then, you’ll learn techniques for reusing
    and organizing code with functions ([Chapter 5](chapter5.xhtml)) and classes ([Chapter
    6](chapter6.xhtml)).

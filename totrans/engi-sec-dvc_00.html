<p class="noindent">Internet connectivity, digital business models and data-driven services, remote access, and data analytics—all contribute to a variety of needs and challenges across nearly every industry. To put it simply, most modern products need some kind of computer integrated into them. More specifically, they usually require an <em>embedded system</em>, which means an electronic system including a processing unit, memory, and input/output interfaces that are embedded within a larger mechanical or electronic system.</p>
<p class="indent">The application domains of embedded systems are extremely wide. They’re used in controllers, sensors, and actuators in industrial automation, transportation, and critical infrastructure systems. Communication and network hardware like routers, switches, and base stations are based on them too. In the consumer market, typical products with embedded systems include smart washing machines, intelligent heating systems, and gaming consoles. Even the plastic cards we use for banking and building access control can be considered a type of embedded system.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxii"/>Compared to personal computers (PCs) and server systems, these devices often face constraints, like the need to keep down manufacturing costs or run on hardware with low to moderate computational power, in addition to the rather limited options for input and output capabilities. Embedded systems are used in very specific, sometimes critical areas, and they usually operate with few user interactions, if any. Further, these devices are built from a wide range of hardware, firmware, and operating systems in use across different products, manufacturers, and industries.</p>
<p class="indent">On top of those limitations, adding security requirements to the equation doesn’t make the life of an embedded systems engineer easier. The development of security measures for these devices, their specific application environments, and their constrained resources lead to challenging tasks for architects and developers. As if all these things weren’t enough, in many cases, embedded systems also face physical attackers, which are a more powerful attack model in comparison to remote access on cloud or web services, for example.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1_1"><strong>The State of Embedded System Security</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">If we look at different application domains and industries, the state of security measures in embedded systems varies greatly. For example, smart card solutions for pay-TV were confronted with fraud cases as early as the 1990s. If people could circumvent the scrambling and shuffling algorithms, they were able to watch pay-TV for free. In addition, if attackers succeeded in cloning those smart cards, they could sell them at a lower price, leading to a loss in revenue for the original provider. Since the business model was under pressure, the security awareness of these companies was relatively high, and corresponding investments and developments in smart card security were prioritized.</p>
<p class="indent">Another field of embedded systems in entertainment exhibits a similar pattern: gaming consoles. The natural interest of console manufacturers is that only original game media can be played on their devices. If attackers succeed in running cloned discs, the business model suffers. After the reverse engineering community gained interest in analyzing game consoles, which, for example, led to the renowned book <em>Hacking the Xbox</em> by Andrew Huang (No Starch Press, 2003), the industry responded with increased security mechanisms. As a result, they reached a solid state of embedded system security that requires attackers to invest in a lot of resources, expertise, and sophisticated tools to successfully bypass protection measures.</p>
<p class="indent">However, in other application areas of embedded systems, the components don’t have such mature security features. In 2016, this became quite obvious with the discovery of the <em>Mirai</em> malware that exploited hundreds of thousands of internet of things (IoT) devices, mainly IP cameras and home routers, turning them into botnets that performed enormous distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against websites. Further, the compilations of vulnerabilities dubbed <em>Ripple20</em> and <em>Amnesia:33</em> showed various weaknesses in TCP/IP stacks for embedded systems in 2020. According <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxiii"/>to estimates, more than 15 million devices were affected, from medical to building automation to industrial control systems (ICS).</p>
<p class="indent">Strangely enough, devices used in industrial automation and critical infrastructures, where robustness and reliability are crucial, also have long security to-do lists. Although the <em>Stuxnet</em> incident reports in 2010 were a wake-up call for industrial automation manufacturers, more than 10 years later, the market still has a significant lack of well-protected devices. In 2022, a collection of vulnerabilities in operational technology (OT) components was published under the name of <em>OT:ICEFALL</em>. The authors characterized the security engineering failings as <em>insecurity by design</em> because the analyzed products missed even the most basic security controls.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1_2"><strong>Emerging Requirements, Laws, and Standards</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">As strange as it sounds, without these incidents, vulnerabilities, and attacks, only marginal security awareness would probably exist. However, since we’ve seen many of these issues during the last 20 years while at the same time online connectivity, digital services, and data analytics grew increasingly relevant to companies, cybersecurity “suddenly” has become a requirement—for example, in the procurement process.</p>
<p class="indent">This doesn’t mean customers immediately show deep and comprehensive security knowledge, but they increasingly demand risk analyses, protection measures, or a (random) collection of standards to be fulfilled by product manufacturers. From my experiences in the industrial context, this sometimes initiates communication between customers and manufacturers to find a compromise between the practical need for security and the associated costs, which can be a reasonable and fruitful discussion for both parties.</p>
<p class="indent">Governments, on the other hand, are increasingly concerned with developing national laws and signing international agreements pushing for basic security requirements that every product on the market should fulfill. In Europe, the Cybersecurity Act (CSA) of 2019 aims to establish a security certification framework for all products and services sold in the European Union, and the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) of 2024 regulates cybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements. The European Standard ETSI EN 303 645 already defines baseline security requirements, especially for consumer IoT products. On the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, Biden’s Executive Order 14028 from May 2021 takes a similar line and aims to improve cybersecurity in IoT devices and software solutions. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) already provides recommendations for cybersecurity labeling of these products.</p>
<p class="indent">In parallel, consortia in various industries try to agree on common security standards in their fields. A prominent example is International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard 62443, targeting ICS security and the industrial IoT (IIoT). It combines security requirements for operators, system integrators, and component manufacturers, which allows for a unified and interrelated security view of industrial systems. Regarding secure <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxiv"/>device engineering, Parts 4-1 and 4-2 of IEC 62443 are the most relevant: Part 4-1 covers practices for a secure development process, and Part 4-2 is concerned with technical product security requirements.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1_3"><strong>Who Should Read This Book?</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">If you’re an embedded systems architect who is involved in customer discussions like those described previously, this book provides you the necessary knowledge to debate with your partners at eye level.</p>
<p class="indent">If you’re an embedded systems engineer or an IoT developer who is in charge of implementing security features and you want to know about the reasoning behind these features and typical obstacles, this book will prepare you for the journey ahead.</p>
<p class="indent">If you’re part of a product’s requirements engineering process or do embedded systems testing in your day-to-day work, this book will help you understand the value of certain security features and why your colleagues from the development team might be reluctant to implement them.</p>
<p class="indent">If you’re a student and wonder why many protection measures can’t be taken for granted in IoT products, this book will confirm that you have the right mindset, and you’ll learn that embedded system security is an important but sometimes tedious task.</p>
<p class="indent">And if, some minutes ago, somebody yelled at you, “We need to implement this f****** device security! NOW!!!” take a deep breath, cancel all appointments, and read through this book carefully. Afterward, you’ll be ready for a friendly, objective discussion about “security.”</p>

<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1_5"><strong>A Note on the Case Studies in This Book</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Several chapters in this book contain practical case studies. Their purpose is <em>not</em> to serve as copy-and-paste examples to be reproduced easily on your own device or even to be used for productive development. That would require a level of detail beyond the scope of this book, and the relevant security insights would vanish in a sea of implementation issues.</p>
<p class="indent">Some of the case studies illustrate gaps between the theory and the messy real world. Others demonstrate the advantages or disadvantages of different implementation options, and some of the case studies just provide a specific application context that should help you understand the preceding ideas and concepts.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxvi"/>As mentioned earlier, embedded systems are a diverse class of devices and so are their processors, memories, and interfaces. In order to provide a reasonable demonstration device—not too high end, not too tiny and constrained—I chose a hardware platform with medium performance that also includes hardware-based security measures that can be analyzed in practical case studies: the STM32MP157F-DK2 evaluation board from STMicroelectronics (ST). (For the record, I have no affiliation with ST.)</p>
<p class="indent">Whenever it comes to operating systems for medium- and high-performance embedded systems, Linux is the natural choice. It’s used in cars, dishwashers, programmable logic controllers (PLCs), TVs, energy monitoring systems, and also in the case studies within this book. Specifically, I used ST’s OpenSTLinux distribution with a Linux 5.15 kernel.</p>

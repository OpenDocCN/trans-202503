<p class="noindents">In the introduction, I explained how there wasn’t space in this book for many of the topics that Volume 2 promised would be included here. Expect to see those topics in Volumes 4, 5, and 6:</p>
<ul>
<li class="noindent"><em>Volume 4: Designing Great Code</em></li>
<li class="noindent"><em>Volume 5: Great Coding</em></li>
<li class="noindent"><em>Volume 6: Testing, Debugging, and Quality Assurance</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Assuming I’m still alive to finish this series, I might add a book on user documentation to the list. About the only thing I can promise is that there won’t be as large a gap between Volumes 3 and 4 as there was between Volumes 2 and 3!</p>
<p class="indent">Volume 4, <em>Designing Great Code</em>, will pick up where the second half of this book left off. In this volume you’ve learned how to document the software development process; in Volume 4 you’ll learn more about the design process and how to apply the knowledge you’ve gained to design great code.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_318"/></p>

    to follow along with the examples. Whenever you solve a practice problem or Try
    It Out exercise, you can check your answers with the files in the *Solutions*
    folder. Learn even more about Scratch by reading the information about the Paint
    Editor, mathematical functions, and drawing geometric shapes in the *Extra Resources*
    folder. If you want to try out more guided examples, you’ll even find extra games
    and simulations to go along with several chapters in the *Bonus Applications*
    folder.

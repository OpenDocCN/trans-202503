- en: Design work may never feel easy, especially when you first start out. Your first
    sketches and mock-ups are more likely to feel terrible than good. Designing, unlike
    programming, is so qualitative rather than quantitative — we rely on our gut to
    tell us whether something looks and feels right; you will likely think that your
    first pieces of work are *not* working right.

    you’re working on a new design and it doesn’t feel like it’s going well, you’re
    going through the same process as every other designer. Through iteration, inspiration,
    research, and work, your design will improve.

    iteration to iteration, new design work to new design work.

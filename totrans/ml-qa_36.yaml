- en: This book has taken you on a journey that began with the foundational concepts
    of machine learning, such as embeddings, latent spaces, and representations, and
    advanced techniques and architectures, including self-supervised learning, few-shot
    learning, and transformers. It also covered many practical techniques, such as
    model deployment, multi-GPU training, and data-centric AI, and dove into specialized
    domains like computer vision and natural language processing.

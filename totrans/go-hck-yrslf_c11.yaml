- en: You’ve come to the end of this book, but you’re just beginning your journey
    as an ethical hacker. You now know the tricks and tools the bad guys use—and how
    to defend against the major sources of attacks (physical hacks, social engineering,
    search engine recon, car and IoT hacking, malware, password cracking, web server
    hacking, and mobile device hacking). In other words, you’ve learned to hack yourself
    first! This last chapter is a quick review of the 10 most important things you
    can do to protect yourself and the people you care about from attacks online and
    in the real world.

    and then they wind up becoming victims of malicious hacks. This book has shown
    you that it’s surprisingly simple to hack most devices, and no one is completely
    safe from online threats. By taking a few smart precautions, however, you can
    at least avoid being an *easy* target for attackers. Knowing that you’re a potential
    target—and that your personal information is valuable to the average black hat
    hacker—is an important first step in protecting yourself and the people you care
    about.

    stop and think about whether it’s in your best interest. From pushy used-car salespeople
    to cybercriminals to online predators, attackers use human psychology to try to
    trick us into doing what they want.

    for your personal information, consider who they are really. What are they asking
    for, and why do they need that information? Where possible, avoid being put in
    the position of giving up your information altogether: block unwanted contacts
    and social media connections, delete suspicious emails without replying, hang
    up on robocalls, and delete spam SMS text messages. Any of these nuisances can
    be an attacker’s way in.'

    social media. Before you post, snap, tweet, or share, think about who can see
    your posts and what they could do with that information. Pictures of yourself
    and your friends, places you go (*never* post vacation photos while you’re still
    on vacation), and things you like can all be used by an attacker to trick you
    into trusting them.

    stalking, or harassment to your local authorities.

    you are about online safety. Lock your doors, protect your belongings, and be
    careful what you plug into your computer. If you walk away from your laptop in
    a coffee shop for even a few minutes, an attacker can access your files or walk
    off with the whole computer. A flash drive or other device plugged into your computer
    can be used to steal files or launch malware.

    not using them. In addition to saving battery life, you’ll be blocking attacks.
    The same goes for mobile devices, where you should also close apps when you’re
    done with them. Turn off your computer and phone overnight if you can. You’ll
    sleep better with the added peace of mind—and you’ll lower your electric bill
    by a few bucks a month!

    Examine web links carefully—or run them through VirusTotal—before clicking. Better
    yet, open a new browser and search for the real site rather than clicking through
    an email, even if it looks legit.
  prefs: []

- en: Don’t download or install software over the web unless you trust the source,
    and even then, check it in VirusTotal or your virus scanner first. Don’t open
    suspicious attachments, including Office documents, PDFs, and videos; verify the
    source or scan the files for viruses to be safer. And don’t share or download
    illegal files or pirated software, music, or movies. Malicious hackers love to
    hide evil surprises in these “free” files.

    read the list of permissions the app is asking for. A game or simple app shouldn’t
    need access to your contacts, call logs, or text messages—and other than augmented-reality
    or location-based apps like *Pokémon Go*, an app shouldn’t require your location.
    If an app asks for more permissions than you think it should need, delete it and
    find one that does what you want with fewer permissions.

- en: Most people’s passwords can be cracked in seconds or minutes. Eight characters
    for a password is never enough. Use a memorable passphrase of four or more words
    with a mixture of character types (including letters, numbers, symbols, and even
    non-keyboard characters). Don’t reuse the same password for multiple sites; even
    if you add numbers or special characters, it takes only a few seconds for a hacker
    to crack a password that’s similar to one they already know.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Don’t store passwords in a browser—remember, you can reveal those passwords
    with just a few clicks! Instead, use a *password manager*, like KeePass, Dashlane,
    LastPass, or similar. A password manager randomly generates hard, complex (20+
    character) passwords for all your accounts and stores them in encrypted form.
    You set one long passphrase to access your password manager, then let the password
    manager handle all the other passwords automatically so you don’t have to remember
    them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Password managers are considered safe because they actually encrypt your passwords
    using military-grade encryption. This is very different from security through
    obscurity like we saw your browser using in Chapter 1\. Rather than simply hiding
    your other passwords, a password manager secures them by making them unrecoverable
    if an attacker doesn’t have your long passphrase. By analogy, a password manager
    is like putting your house key in a two-ton bulletproof safe with a 20-number
    combination lock anchored to your curb rather than hiding the key under your doormat.
    By actually encrypting your passwords before storing them, a password manager
    (with a good passphrase) offers real security, not just obscurity.
  prefs: []

- en: 'There’s just one exception to using a password manager: make sure to keep your
    email password separate and memorize it (rather than just storing it in the manager),
    just in case you ever forget the passphrase for your password manager and need
    to reset all of your passwords using your email. This also protects you in case
    someone tricks you into giving away the passphrase for your password manager—you
    can still reset your other passwords by having reset links sent to your email.
    Ultimately, you only need to remember two passphrases—one for your email and one
    for your password manager—and you can still have unique, almost uncrackable passwords
    for every account.'

- en: For added protection in case an attacker is able to steal or guess one of your
    passwords, turn on two-factor authentication for your most important accounts.
    Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring additional
    verification besides your password to access your most sensitive accounts. Usually,
    the extra verification step involves sending a security code to your cell phone.

    and other apps regularly. It’s best to run updates at least monthly. Pick a certain
    day of the month, like the 1st or 30th, and mark your calendar to update your
    desktop/laptop and all applications. Think of it as another must-do task like
    paying your bills. Update your phone, smart TV, and other devices as soon as you
    can when an update is available.

    vulnerabilities they could exploit in older versions. Once an attacker sees that
    a problem has been fixed, anyone who hasn’t downloaded that fix becomes a sitting
    duck. That’s why most of the 2,000+ exploits in Kali attack older versions of
    software. Keeping all of your software up-to-date will eliminate over 99 percent
    of the known attacks on the internet.

    Instead, do sensitive work only on your most protected computer—one that is kept
    in a secure location and that has a good antivirus program, firewall, up-to-date
    software, strong account controls, and very few installed programs. Use a complex
    password and secure Wi-Fi at home and check your router for unknown devices regularly,
    at least once a month.

- en: Consider keeping your most private data, like credit card information, tax forms,
    and health records, off your computer altogether. Otherwise, for sensitive information
    on your computer that you want to protect at the maximum level possible, consider
    encrypting the files, or encrypt the entire hard drive of the computer you do
    sensitive work on. On Windows Professional edition, you can encrypt your whole
    hard drive with BitLocker, or you can encrypt individual files and folders by
    right-clicking and choosing **Advanced . . .**▶**Encrypt contents to secure data**.
    On macOS, you can use FileVault to encrypt your hard drive by going to **System
    Preferences**▶**Security & Privacy**▶**FileVault**. I won’t go through the full
    steps here, but the encryption programs should guide you, and a quick web search
    can help if you get stuck. Open source encryption packages like VeraCrypt also
    let you encrypt files, folders, or entire drives with a password or passphrase
    in just a few steps. You can download VeraCrypt at [https://www.veracrypt.fr/](https://www.veracrypt.fr/).

- en: It’s okay to store your encryption password in a password manager to keep from
    forgetting it. Your files will still be completely useless to a thief who steals
    your hard drive or laptop or to a ransomware attacker who tries to steal data
    from your computer before locking it down and demanding a ransom.

    are several free and low-cost antivirus tools out there. Research which ones stop
    the most malware and then update your antivirus tool weekly, or turn on automatic
    updates, to give it the best shot at protecting you. Firewalls and antivirus software
    can only protect you if they’re turned on and up-to-date.

- en: Consider using a VPN app to protect your phone or laptop while traveling or
    when using public Wi-Fi. A VPN, or *virtual private network*, masks your identity
    and encrypts your data as you use the internet, so anyone spying on the network
    won’t be able to see your information. With a VPN, you’ll be more secure than
    most of your peers and safer from most online attacks.

    or accidental deletion—is to back it up often. Back up your files to an external
    hard drive weekly or monthly (depending on how stressed you’d be if you lost a
    month’s worth of data).

    to avoid losing both at the same time. Or skip the hassle and use a cloud backup
    service for a few dollars a month. Search online for one that’s highly rated and
    has the features you want and need.

    parents and older relatives, know the kinds of threats and attacks you’ve learned
    to defend against in this book. Online criminals and predators are after their
    accounts and identities just like they’re after yours. Encourage them to stop
    and think before answering a suspicious or threatening email, phone call, or text
    message. You can even offer to be their “reality check” if they’re not sure what
    to do. Sometimes just talking about an online offer or threat can help the intended
    target see that it’s a scam.

    talk about online and real-world threats, and *listen* to your kids. Know who
    their friends are and who they’re talking to online. Consider tracking each other’s
    devices—allow your kids to track your cell phone and vice versa. Make sure they
    understand the dangers of oversharing online. Most importantly, encourage them
    to talk to you if they’re ever unsure what to do or if they ever experience cyberbullying
    or harassment.

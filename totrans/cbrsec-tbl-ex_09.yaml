    executive audience, which can include an organization’s C-level employees and
    the leaders of various teams, such as business operations, human resources, legal,
    and marketing.

- en: It isn’t unusual for cybersecurity incidents, especially those that bleed into
    the public realm or interrupt operations, to require these cross-functional leaders
    to collaboratively manage the response. Unfortunately, while technical teams regularly
    work together, it’s less common for, say, the legal and marketing teams to collaborate.
    For this reason, it’s important to conduct regular tabletop exercises that test
    leadership’s ability to work together in response to an incident.

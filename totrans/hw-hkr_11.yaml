    tend to pick from a palette of existing processes to develop products. Most consumer
    electronic devices are an amalgamation of rigid PCBs with SMT reflow or through-hole
    wave soldering, ABS or PC injection molding, sheet-metal forming, and some finishing
    processes like painting or electroplating. These options cover the full range
    of utility most products require. Really outstanding products, however, also tend
    to introduce new materials or novel manufacturing processes.

    willing to go onto the factory floor and direct the improvements yourself. In
    other words, the expensive bit of process development is typically paying the
    experts developing and qualifying the process, not so much the equipment or materials.

- en: To prove that point to myself, I started exploring flex circuits as a design
    medium. Instead of using a 1- or 2-millimeter-thick rigid substrate composed of
    woven glass fiber impregnated with a stiff epoxy, flex circuits typically use
    a pliable polymer substrate just fractions of a millimeter thick. Polyimide is
    a popular substrate in flex circuits because of its ability to withstand soldering
    temperatures. Although flex-circuit technology is common inside consumer products
    (a mobile phone probably contains at least a half-dozen flex PCBs, connecting
    peripherals like buttons, cameras, and displays to the mainboard), this technology
    is underrepresented in hobby and DIY products. But I don’t think it has to be.
  prefs: []

- en: I had a hunch that the right kind of product designed in flex could enable new
    and creative applications, but I wasn’t quite sure how, so I decided to learn
    more about the unique benefits and challenges of designing for flexible circuits.
    As part of a project where I explored the guts of SD cards, which I’ll talk more
    about in [Chapter 9](ch09.xhtml#ch09), I needed to create an adapter for my Novena
    that would allow me to snoop and emulate the NAND flash memory found inside certain
    styles of older SD cards. The thinness and pliability of flexible circuits were
    a great match for the job.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The resulting adapter was very thin; it fit perfectly under the TSOP package
    of the NAND. The bendy nature of the board meant I could also accommodate a broad
    variety of target board shapes, even boards much larger than a typical SD card.
    Although a useful application of flexible circuits, it still felt like I was just
    scratching the surface of possibility.

    paper electronics to make technology more relevant and accessible to non-engineering
    audiences. On our trip to Shenzhen, we discussed the possibility of building circuits
    on flex and then soldering a flex circuit onto paper. In the end, she felt that
    would be at best a marginal improvement. Although soldering isn’t a difficult
    skill to master, the high temperatures, chemicals, and specialized equipment involved
    are a major deterrent to beginners. What would really be magical is if circuits
    could be assembled like stickers on a page. Wouldn’t it be great if we could use
    flex-circuit technology with traditional SMT reflow processes to create modules
    that users could then stick onto wires made of copper tape?

    into projects using nontraditional materials. Such friendly and expressive materials

    In the magnified section of Z-tape laminated onto a polyimide substrate shown
    here, the silvery-white stipples are tiny metal particles that span from one side
    of the adhesive layer to the other according to a statistical distribution. Given
    the nature of the metal distribution, to ensure good electrical contact, each
    pad on a circuit sticker needed to be fairly large. Furthermore, traces very close
    to each other could be shorted out by the embedded metal particles, so as I designed
    the circuits, I had to be careful to leave enough space between exposed pads.
    The datasheet for the Z-tape material contains rules for the minimum pad size
    and spacing, so I used those as a guide.

    reliably stays intact over thousands of flexing cycles. Sometimes, however, you
    want to make portions of a flex circuit stiff; for instance, a part of the circuit
    might need to stay stiff for mechanical mounting, and a stiff circuit is also
    helpful for SMT processing.

    invaluable opportunity to see the wide range of complex shapes that could be produced
    thanks to die cutting. Having a variety of possible shapes was key, because we

    of the defective units, I developed a set of design rules for maintaining high
    yield (and therefore lowering cost) on the circuit stickers.

    candidate” stickers. They included LEDs of four different colors (white, red,
    blue, and yellow), as well as two sets of smart stickers. The first set of smart
    stickers contained a preprogrammed microcontroller that could generate patterns
    of light, such as fading, heartbeats, twinkling, and blinking. We called these
    the “effects” stickers; they are a form of *physical programming* that enables
    noncoders to customize the behavior of their projects. The second set contained
    a user-programmable microcontroller with a fun record-and-playback capability
    loaded into it as a demo, along with three sensors. We called these the “sensor

    be process-compatible with the type of die cutting necessary to create stickers.

    what other people could do with circuit stickers. As this was part of Jie’s doctoral
    research, we had two options for doing user testing. The traditional academic
    approach would have been to apply for a budget from her advisor, produce a limited
    number of stickers, and conduct a series of closed workshops to study how young
    and creative minds interacted with this new media. But this happened in 2013,
    so viable crowdfunding platforms unlocked the possibility of offering our research
    directly to interested users, thus allowing us to conduct research at scale. The
    MIT Media Lab where Jie researched is also very keyed in to the possibilities
    enabled by research at scale, as embodied by their “deploy” initiative. In 2011,
    when Joi Ito became the Media Lab’s new director, he started transforming the
    Media Lab’s culture from “demo or die” to “deploy or die,” which was eventually
    shortened to the less menacing “deploy” directive. Under the old “demo or die”
    regime, research groups were encouraged to create whizzy demonstrations of technology
    that could help raise money. Under Ito’s directive, the idea is to get technology
    out of the lab and into the wild by conducting research at scale through tools
    like crowdfunding and lean hardware.

    The book is unusual because you’re meant to paste electronic circuits into it,
    so we had to customize several aspects of the printing. The paper had to be the
    right thickness to get good light diffusion when LEDs were placed underneath a
    sheet. The binding needed special attention for a better circuit-crafting experience,
    and there’s even a little pocket in the back to hold swatches of craft material
    used as part of the projects in the book.

    of traditional book printing or binding requires such knowledge. The printer originally
    said they couldn’t guarantee anything about the conductivity of the binding wire.
    Sure enough, while the first sample wire was nonconductive, the second was conductive,

    we use 渐变 (“gradual change”) for *fade* and 闪烁 (“flickering, twinkling”) for *twinkle*.
    I’m still not convinced that was a bulletproof description, but it was superior
    to any translation I came up with. And, to this day, we are dogged by problems
    trying to explain to quality control staff the difference between these effects.
    It turns out that a malfunctioning sticker *also* makes a pretty good twinkling
    effect—for a while.

    “twinkle” effect should look like. She described our first iteration of the effect
    as “closer to a lightning storm than twinkling.” We had several long conversations
    on the topic, followed by demo videos to clarify the desired effect. We basically
    tweaked code until it looked about right to both of us. Given the difficulty we
    had describing the effect to each other, it’s no surprise I had trouble accurately
    describing the effect in Chinese.

- en: About six weeks before we finalized our order for the Chibitronics kits with
    the factory, Jie suggested that we include a stencil of the sticker patterns with
    the sensor and microcontroller kits. She reasoned that it can be difficult to
    lay out the copper tape patterns for complex stickers like the microcontroller,
    which has seven pads, without a drawing of the contact patterns. I originally
    resisted the idea; I didn’t want to delay shipment on account of something we
    didn’t originally promise. As Jie discovered, I can be very temperamental, especially
    when it comes to schedule slips. (Sorry, Jie! Thanks for bearing with me.)

    vendor. After two weeks, we hadn’t found anyone willing to take the job, but our
    factory’s sourcing department didn’t give up. Eventually, they found one vendor
    who had enough material in stock to tool up a die cutter and turn around a couple
    thousand stencils within two weeks—just barely in time to meet the schedule.

    I gave them a whirl. Jie was absolutely right about their utility. I found my
    experience vastly improved when I had a template to work from, particularly for
    the microcontroller sticker with seven closely spaced pads, and I felt users would
    agree. That’s how even though the stencil wasn’t promised as part of the original
    campaign, all backers who ordered the sensor and microcontroller kit received
    a free stencil to help them lay out designs.

    essentially wrote off the month of February. Reality matched this expectation,

- en: We had a draft manuscript of our book ready in January, but I couldn’t get a
    complete sample until March. That wasn’t because the printer was closed for a
    month straight; like everyone else, their holiday was about two weeks long. The
    paper vendor, however, started their holiday about 10 days before the printer,
    and the binding vendor ended their holiday about 10 days after the printer. Even
    though each vendor took only two weeks off, the net supply chain for printing
    a custom book was out for around 24 days, or effectively the entire month of February.
    The staggered observance of Chinese New Year is necessary because of the sheer
    magnitude of human migration that accompanies the holiday.

    selling circuit stickers—taking the book into account, by volume and weight, our
    principal product was printed paper. To optimize logistics cost, I pushed to ship
    starter kits (which contained a book) and additional stand-alone book orders by
    ocean, rather than air.
  prefs: []

- en: We actually had starter kits and books ready to go almost four weeks before
    the first kits shipped, but we just couldn’t get a reasonable quotation for the
    cost of shipping them by ocean. We spent almost three weeks haggling and quoting
    with ocean freight companies. In the end, their price was basically the same as
    going by air but would take three weeks longer and incurred more risk. Freight
    cost is apparently a minor component of shipping by ocean, and you get killed
    by a multitude of surcharges, from paying the longshoremen to paying all the intermediate
    brokers and warehouses that handle your goods at the dock. Those fixed costs added
    up such that even though we were shipping over 60 cartons of goods, air shipping
    was still more cost-effective.

    before they hatched. Problems ranging from a routine UPS screwup to a tragic aviation
    accident to a logistics problem at Crowd Supply’s fulfillment depot to a customs

    within our power to deliver on time.

    on time. Since then, Chibitronics has continued to surpass my wildest expectations.
    Although we started this project as an academic experiment, grassroots user adoption
    prompted us to grow the experiment into a full-fledged company. As the circuit
    stickers are an open hardware project, the specs are available for savvy hackers
    to play with, but most users are nontechnical folks who would benefit more directly
    from support on basic usage. To that end, the company strives to provide users
    with assistance, activities, and more stickers to help them keep learning and
    making beautiful electronic crafts.

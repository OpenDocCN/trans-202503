    In the United States, the best one is the National Cryptologic Museum, which is
    the doorway to NSA’s headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland. If you are in the United
    Kingdom, go to Bletchley Park, and in Germany, visit the Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum
    in Paderborn or the Deutsches Museum in Munich. These institutions exhibit fascinating
    cipher machines, such as the Enigma (see [Chapter 15](c15.xhtml)), as well as
    other crypto-related items.

    were correct, `D` would be the most frequent letter in our text. In the case of
    `REENTER`, it would be `E`. The latter is by far the more likely case. Knowing
    that `VEERKEV` stands for `REENTER` thus gives us the potential plaintext equivalents
    of four letters. We could then substitute those potential plaintext equivalents
    throughout the ciphertext, then proceed to guess short words such as `THE`, `TO`,

    and started to work on deciphering the diary. Though Potter’s encryption method
    was a pure monoalphabetic cipher, the codebreaking work proved difficult. Potter’s
    writing was small, sometimes tiny, with thousands of words squeezed onto some
    of the pages (see [Figure 3-7](#figure3-7)).

    for eight letters of the alphabet, including four vowels. By the end of the same

    One thing of note for those who may wish to crack a diary belonging to their own
    ancestors is that it is very difficult to write large amounts of text with a complicated
    cipher. It therefore comes as no surprise that nearly all of the encrypted diaries
    we know of used simple substitution ciphers, though perhaps with some additional
    expressions here and there to make writing easier. In Potter’s case, she used
    `2` for the words `to` and `too`, as well as `3` for `the`. As a rule of thumb,
    the more handwritten encrypted text you see, the easier it will be to solve.

- en: On September 25, 1990, an unknown person sent the postcard depicted in [Figure
    3-12](#figure3-12) to the *Vallejo Times-Herald*, a newspaper in the San Francisco
    area. The message on the postcard imitates the style of the Zodiac Killer, a serial
    murderer who sent encrypted letters to regional newspapers in the late 1960s.^([24](b06.xhtml#c03-endnote-24))
    (The Zodiac murder case and the cryptograms connected to it are explained in [Chapter
    6](c06.xhtml).) The identity of the postcard’s author is not known, but it is
    not likely the Zodiac Killer himself.^([25](b06.xhtml#c03-endnote-25)) This means
    that we are dealing with a Zodiac copycat cryptogram (of which you will see more
    over the course of this book).

- en: The three lines of cleartext on the card contain the name and the location of
    the newspaper, as well as the expression `CELEBRITY CYPHER`. A *celebrity cypher*
    (today usually spelled *celebrity cipher*) is a crypto puzzle (typically an Aristocrat)
    that, once deciphered, turns out to be a quote by a famous person. Celebrity ciphers
    are quite popular among the members of the American Cryptogram Association and
    other puzzle enthusiasts. There are entire books and web pages dedicated to celebrity
    ciphers. Elonka’s book *The Mammoth Book of Secret Codes and Cryptograms* contains
    scores of them.^([26](b06.xhtml#c03-endnote-26))

- en: The copycat postcard message (referred to as the Zodiac Celebrity Cypher) has
    never been solved. It is, of course, possible that it encrypts a quote by a famous
    person, but we don’t know this for sure.

- en: It goes without saying that codebreakers have checked whether the creator of
    the Zodiac Celebrity Cypher message might have used the encryption systems found
    in the first two Zodiac cryptograms (which are solved), to no avail. There are
    several web pages providing information about the Zodiac Celebrity Cypher, some
    of which even suggest alleged solutions. However, from what we have seen so far,
    none of these makes sense.

- en: The postcard depicted in [Figure 3-13](#figure3-13) was written by soccer official
    George Furlong (1843-1911) from Luton, United Kingdom, to his sister Lizzie in
    1873.^([27](b06.xhtml#c03-endnote-27)) Unlike most of the encrypted postcards
    of the time that we know about, this one hasn’t been solved.

- en: The script in which this postcard is written is a mystery of its own. It could
    be an ordinary, yet rarely used, writing system or an invented, secret script.
    It could also be a kind of shorthand, except that some of the letters (e.g., the
    triangle-shaped symbol) are not well suited for speedy writing. At least we can
    tell that the author wrote fluently and was practiced in using these glyphs. Transcribing
    this cryptogram is difficult, as some letters are written on top of each other.
    Numerous skilled codebreakers, including fans of Klaus’s blog, tried their luck
    on this message without success. Perhaps a reader can shed light on this unusual
    secret?

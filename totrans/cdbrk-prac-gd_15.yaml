    algorithms used before cipher machines and computers were invented. If you encounter
    a cryptogram created prior to 1900, chances are very high that the encryption
    method used is covered in this book. The same is true if you are dealing with
    an encrypted letter, postcard, or diary, no matter when it was written. Many encrypted
    documents from the twentieth century are encrypted using one of the systems mentioned

    radio a few decades later. Unwanted parties can eavesdrop on communications in
    both technologies. Radio communication is especially threatened, as a listener
    needs only an antenna and a radio device to do so, which is why *voice encryption*—also
    known as “ciphony”—inevitably became an important issue. Especially in the military,
    which adopted telephony and voice radio early, there was a demand for secure and
    convenient voice encryption devices.

    technology than text encryption. When engineers started to work on voice encryption
    systems in the early twentieth century, they faced a number of severe challenges.
    Voice transmission was analog at that time, and even today, it is difficult to
    encrypt analog signals in a secure way. It therefore comes as no surprise that
    virtually all voice encryption machines of the first generation used algorithms
    that could be broken without much effort.

    a voice encryption device that was secure and could also be built at a reasonable
    price. The most famous voice encryption machine of the war was the SIGSALY, an
    apparatus constructed by the Americans. It was extremely complex and filled a
    whole room. The SIGSALY encrypted digitized voice data with a one-time pad scheme,
    the keys of which were provided on vinyl records. The SIGSALY was probably the
    only secure means of voice encryption in World War II. However, the technology
    was expensive, which resulted in only a few copies being built. These devices
    were used only at the highest levels of the military.^([5](b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-5))

    and less expensive, while new digitization methods, combined with new ciphers,
    provided a higher level of security. Dozens, if not hundreds, of encrypting telephones
    and radio devices were developed during this period, mainly for military and diplomatic
    uses. However, little is known about the encryption methods these Cold War devices
    used, as most of this information is still classified.

    cryptanalysis mainly consisted of unscrambling analog signals, which was often
    not very difficult. With the advent of voice digitization early in the Cold War,
    the job for the codebreakers became increasingly challenging. Today, voice encryption
    cryptanalysis is no longer its own topic, since the algorithms used for this purpose

    names, geographical expressions, and other words they could not translate. In
    addition, code words for military terms that did not exist in the code talkers’
    language were introduced. In many cases, `TURTLE` stood for `TANK`, while bird
    names denoted different kinds of airplanes. Before being sent into service, each
    code talker was trained in the code and became familiar with the radio technology

    occasions, if one is dealing with an especially exotic shorthand, is cryptanalysis

    finished the most remarkable of his over ninety works, a three-book set titled
    *Steganographia*. The first two books describe over fifty variants of a communication
    method that we doubt ever worked. This method requires the sender to cast a certain
    magic spell, causing a ghost to appear. This ghost subsequently transmits the
    message with the help of a number of supporting ghosts. The receiver then needs
    to cast another magic spell in order to access the message. For every variant
    of this process, Trithemius provides long lists of parameters, such as the number
    and names of supporting ghosts.

    magic communication techniques described in the first two books were mere hoaxes.
    Their true purpose was to encode messages in the parameters listed: Trithemius
    disguised messages as descriptions of magic processes, a form of steganography.
    In fact, the title *Steganographia* even gave the science of steganography its
    name. The word “steganography” was, for centuries, used synonymously with “cryptography,”
    until David Kahn popularized the definition given at the beginning of this chapter

    tombstone but also in a book they wrote. Their 1957 work titled *The Shakespearean
    Ciphers Examined* evaluates a number of theories alleging that Francis Bacon (1561–1626)
    was the real author of the works usually attributed to William Shakespeare (1564–1616),
    and that Bacon included hidden messages in these writings that confirmed his authorship.^([36](b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-36))
    The story is of personal interest to the Friedmans, as it was through this research
    that they met. In the early 1900s, Elizebeth (née Smith) had been hired by the
    eccentric millionaire George Fabyan to search for hidden messages in Shakespeare’s
    works. While working at Fabyan’s think tank in Riverbank Laboratories near Chicago,
    she met a researcher in a different part of the lab, the young geneticist William
    Friedman. As a photographer, he helped with her research. She taught him about
    codes, they fell in love, and the rest is history. In their 1957 book, the Friedmans
    took time to closely examine the Shakespeare-Bacon controversy and definitively
    show that all the Bacon code theories were nonsense.

    radio messages. Virtually all systems used were either manual or based on simple
    tools, such as cipher disks and cipher slides. Unfortunately, most of these methods
    were broken by enemy forces quite quickly. They also suffered a further weakness
    in that they were complicated to use, especially in wartime conditions. Soldiers
    who had to encrypt or decrypt text while taking cover in a trench, suffering from
    bad weather, and being distracted by gunshots and bomb explosions nearby were
    already overtaxed. Inevitably, many errors occurred. Often, a recipient could
    not even decrypt an encrypted message due to a faulty encipherment.
  prefs: []

- en: Based on these experiences, many new encryption techniques were developed in
    the years following World War I. Because it had become obvious that manual encryption
    was not suited for high-security and high-volume radio traffic at any time, let
    alone under wartime conditions, new encryption machines were designed to be more
    secure and user-friendly than manual ciphers (see [Figure 15-10](#figure15-10)).
    The concept of cipher machines was not necessarily new, as some designs had already
    been in existence for decades. But after the failure of cryptography in World
    War I, the pressure was high enough to finally put these ideas into practice.

    machine. This kind of device comprises a typewriter-like keyboard, an output unit
    (some designs used a set of lamps, with every lamp indicating a letter of the
    alphabet), a source of current, and a set of rotors. The diagram in [Figure 15-11](#figure15-11)
    shows a simplified three-rotor design with an alphabet of six letters. Real machines,
    of course, worked with an alphabet of twenty-six or more letters.

    each letter is entered, the rightmost rotor turns by one unit. After a complete
    turn of this rotor, the next one turns by one unit, too, and once this one has
    revolved, the last one moves by one unit, like an odometer counter. Decryption
    on these machines works in a similar way: they need to be switched to a different
    mode, which causes the current to flow in the opposite direction through the rotors.
    The operator enters the ciphertext letter by pressing a key, after which the plaintext
    letter is indicated by a lamp.'

    Enigma messages in a factory-like facility. British codebreakers, among them renowned
    mathematician Alan Turing, developed their own machine to help with their efforts.
    The design was partially based on the work of the Polish cryptanalysts, especially
    their deduction of the wiring of the Enigma rotors, but was otherwise substantially
    different. The British called their own machine a Bombe, and hundreds were built
    by the British Tabulating Machine Company for the war effort.

    encryption machines were created during a “golden age” that spanned World War
    II and the early Cold War. For instance, in World War II, Japanese diplomats used

    ^([44](b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-44)) The full Japanese name was “System 97 Typewriter

    by one of William Friedman’s teams in the US Army Signal Intelligence Service,
    led by Frank Rowlett. They did so by looking for helpful phrases that the Japanese
    used frequently at the beginning of their radio messages, such as “I have the
    honor to inform your excellency,” which often provided a crib with which to start.

    named two of the earlier Japanese naval encryption systems, which were codes and

    kept the intercepted messages. They named other Japanese encryption systems other

    was only declassified in the last twenty years, was the Lorenz SZ40/42, also known
    by the British as “Tunny,” meaning “tuna fish.” It was introduced in 1940 as a
    cipher attachment that could be added in-line to large teleprinter machines, so
    it was not portable like the Enigma. It was used only at the highest military
    levels, such as for Hitler’s direct communications with his generals. The Lorenz
    had twelve notched wheels and over five hundred pins, and it would encrypt the
    outgoing text and decrypt the incoming text of a teletype.

    Then it would rapidly translate the plaintext into an encrypted version of Baudot
    code and send it to the receiver via radio or landline. At the receiving end,
    another in-line Lorenz attachment would decrypt the message and send it on to
    the receiver teleprinter so that a plaintext message could be printed out. All
    of this was considerably faster than the laborious letter-by-letter process required
    by the Enigma.^([46](b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-46))

    paper by Donald Davies in *Cryptologia*.^([47](b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-47)) Following
    this publication, the US and UK governments gradually began declassifying various
    related documents over the next several years.^([48](b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-48))
    Now that a more complete picture of the Lorenz system has emerged, we know that
    it was another of the encryption methods cracked at Bletchley Park—this time in
    1942 by a team including John Tiltman and William T. “Bill” Tutte. This was an
    impressive accomplishment, considering they had never even seen the machine.^([49](b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-49))
    Another team of fifty people, put together and led by Thomas H. Flowers, designed
    a different kind of decryption machine, distinct from the Bombe, to assist with
    efforts to decrypt the Tunny messages. It was called the Colossus, and it was
    a massive, room-sized apparatus that could be reconfigured from day to day. A
    Post Office factory in Birmingham was commandeered to build the necessary parts,
    and as the war went on, ten different Colossi were constructed.

    it provided substantial information, both about the movements of the German army
    and about the German leadership’s understanding (or misunderstanding) of Allied
    plans. According to Colossus engineer Thomas Flowers, on June 5, 1944, a decrypted
    message was provided to US General Dwight D. Eisenhower showing that, though the
    Germans knew there was a planned invasion of Normandy, they didn’t believe it
    was real. They thought, instead, that it was just a feint to draw German troops
    away from the ports.^([50](b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-50)) This intelligence was thus
    a key factor in the Allied decision to launch the full “Operation Overlord” invasion
    of France on D-Day (June 6), which turned the tide of the war for the Allies in
    Europe.^([51](b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-51)) Historians looking back on this era estimate
    that the intel from Bletchley, including the Tunny decrypts, shortened the war
    in Europe by several months. In 1954, Eisenhower described it as being of priceless
    value and that it had saved thousands of British and American lives.^([52](b06.xhtml#c15-endnote-52))

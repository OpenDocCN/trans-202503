			<p class="ChapterIntro"><a id="17"/>If you
have no previous Inkscape experience and
little to no experience with other vector
editors, this introductory chapter is for you. These are your first baby steps in the new
world. If you have already tried working in Inkscape and feel like you can re-create this
chapter's final example (<a href="#fig2-26">Figure 2-26</a>) on your own, feel free to
skip to the next chapter.</p>
			<a id="section2.1"/><h2>2.1 Installing Inkscape</h2>
			<p>
				The first question to ask yourself before installing Inkscape is
whether you want a <em>stable version</em> or a <em>development
build</em>. Stable versions have been officially released and have version
numbers associated with them. Calling a version stable does not
mean it's perfect and never crashes; it just means this version has received a
decent amount of testing, is more completely documented, and is what
most people use. In fact, apart from its stability, the biggest advantage of running a
stable version is that this is what other users run, so fellow Inkscape
artists are more likely to be able to help you.</p>
			<p><a id="18"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_18" title="18"/>Overall, I recommend that you start with a stable version, but
consider upgrading to a development build if you find that you like
Inkscape and want to support its development, or if you need the new
features added since the release (visit the next version's Release
Notes on <a href="http://wiki.inkscape.org/">http://wiki.inkscape.org/</a> to see what's being worked on).</p>
			<p>
				Using a <em>development build</em> has its own 
advantages. First of all, such builds have all the latest and best features,
which may be significant compared to the stable
version (especially if the stable
release is more than a few months old). These new features often include fixes for the important bugs of the
stable version. Also, by running the development version, you help
the development community to discover and iron out new
bugs. Naturally, active developers are more interested in the
development version, so you're more likely to receive prompt help 
directly from the developers.</p>
			<p>But what about stability? Granted, development builds are, on
average, buggier and crash more often. However, if you run into a new 
bug that's driving you crazy—and if that bug is not fixed
quickly enough—you can always go back to the latest stable
version without this bug. (Remember to save often, no matter which version you
use!)</p>

						For many years, Inkscape's stable releases have been numbered below 1.0, and each release
incremented the version number by just 0.01 (for example, 0.40 was followed by 0.41, then 0.42,
and so on). Often, a
0.<em>xx</em> stable release is followed by 0.<em>xx</em>.x bugfix releases (for example, 0.92 was
followed by 0.92.1, then 0.92.2, 0.92.3, 0.92.4), which add no new features but fix some bugs.
In addition, major releases are preceded by alpha and beta versions, for example 1.0beta1.
You can always find out the exact version number, revision, and
build date of your installation of Inkscape by opening <span class="ui">Help<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>About</span> (look at the top-right corner of
the <span class="ui">About</span> window), or by running Inkscape from the command line with the <code>--version</code> parameter (not on Windows, <a href="b03.xhtml#chC">Appendix C</a>).</p>

				On the Inkscape website (<a href="https://inkscape.org/">https://inkscape.org/</a>), choose <span class="ui"><strong>Download</strong></span> from the menu and make your choice of the current
(stable) version or the latest development version. Then, choose a version for your operating
system.</p>

			<p>New development versions are made available fairly
regularly, normally every day. If, however, you want absolutely
up-to-the-minute Inkscape, you can get the very latest Inkscape code from GitLab and compile it
(it's generally easier to set up development on Linux than on Windows or Mac).
This requires an above average level of computer savviness, so we won't discuss it here.</p>
			<a id="section2.2"/><h2>2.2 Inkscape's "Hello, World!"</h2>
			<p>Learning a new programming language traditionally starts with a
"Hello, World!" example. This is a minimal, yet real and working,
program that simply outputs the string "Hello, World!" somewhere 
and then quits. I'll now show you a minimal yet
real Inkscape editing session that includes starting the program,
creating some objects, editing them, and saving the result.</p>
			<p>
				Starting Inkscape is no different from starting any other
program. Depending on your OS and personal preferences, you can
click the icon, select it from a menu, or type <code>inkscape</code>
on the command line.</p>
			<p>
				When first run, Inkscape starts by showing a helpful welcome dialog (<a href="#fig2-1">Figure 2-1</a>). Its first tab, <span class="ui">Quick Setup</span>, lets you tweak the program's appearance and behavior: the theme for the UI and icons (all themes include a <span class="ui">Dark</span> variant), the active set of keyboard shortcuts, and the look of the canvas. On the <span class="ui">Time to Draw</span> tab of this dialog, you can select one of the recently edited documents (if any) or one of the new document templates, categorized into <span class="ui">Print</span>, <span class="ui">Screen</span>, <span class="ui">Video</span>, <span class="ui">Social</span>, and <span class="ui">Others</span> (<a href="c03.xhtml#section3.2">3.2</a>). Also on this tab,  you can uncheck <span class="ui">Show this every time</span> to avoid seeing the dialog in the future.</p>
				<a id="fig2-1"/>
				<figure>
				<img alt="" src="02/welcome.svg.png"/>

					<p>Figure 2-1: Inkscape welcomes you.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="20"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_20" title="20"/>After you dismiss the welcome dialog (by choosing a document or pressing Esc), Inkscape opens its main editing window.<a href="#fig2-2">Figure 2-2</a> shows the
default Inkscape interface.</p>
			<a id="fig2-2"/><figure>

				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 2-2: The first look at Inkscape</p>

			<p>
				Inkscape's window displays a white work area, called the<em>canvas</em>, in the middle and a number of tools and controls at
the edges. The canvas contains a new,
empty, document Inkscape has created for you, so you don't need to select<span class="ui">File<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>New</span>. You can start working on it right away.</p>
			<p>
				In the column of icons on the left, click the icon
with the blue square. This is the Rectangle tool that lets you
create and edit rectangles. Now, click the mouse button anywhere on the canvas and
drag (or tap and drag if you're using a tablet). A blue rectangle will appear; when you release the mouse, the
rectangle will be created as a new <em>object</em> in your
document (<a href="#fig2-3">Figure 2-3</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig2-3"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="02/rectui.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 2-3: We have created a rectangle.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="21"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_21" title="21"/>Now, click the <span class="ui"><strong>A</strong></span> button on the left, which will switch you to the
Text tool. Click (but do not drag) inside the rectangle. You will see a
text cursor blinking where you clicked. Type <code><strong>Hello, World!</strong></code>. You have
just created a text object, the second object in your document (<a href="#fig2-4">Figure 2-4</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig2-4"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="02/textui.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 2-4: We have added some text.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Now, you may have a better idea for the size, position, or color of your
objects. Easy fix! In the toolbar on the left, click the topmost
button (an arrow). This is the Selector tool. Now you can move
any of the objects anywhere on the canvas by dragging with the
mouse. To change the color of an object, simply drag that color from
the color palette at the bottom of the window and drop it on the object.</p>
			<p>
				Enough tweaking. The document looks perfect. The only problem
with it is that it's not saved to a file yet. Just select <span class="ui"><strong>File<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Save</strong></span>, navigate to the folder of your choice, and type a
filename. That's all. You have just created a new SVG document
with graphics and text. Congratulations!</p>
			<a id="section2.3"/><h2>2.3 Interface Overview</h2>
			<p>
				Let's take a closer look at Inkscape's interface (<a href="#fig2-5">Figure 2-5</a>).</p>
				<a id="fig2-5"/>
				<figure>
				<img alt="" src="02/elementsui.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 2-5: Elements of the Inkscape interface</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>It's usually best to maximize Inkscape's window.
If you need even more space for work, press F11 to toggle
fullscreen mode.</p>
			<p>
				Most of the window is occupied by the <em>canvas</em>, surrounded by rulers (top and
left) and scroll bars (bottom and right). On the canvas, you can see a rectangular page
(A4 paper size by default) with a shadow. This <em>page frame</em> defines the edges of your
document. However, Inkscape allows you to draw freely anywhere, both on and off the
page—the page frame is not a limit, just a hint. This frame matters only when you
export into some vector formats and when you view your SVG file in an external
viewer; in both cases, you will only see the objects that overlap the page rectangle. 
You can hide the page frame if you don't care about it.</p>
			<p><a id="22"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_22" title="22"/>The part of the canvas you see is far from all the canvas there
is. In fact, the canvas is so huge, it is almost infinite. You can
view more of it by zooming out or by scrolling in any direction, as
you will see in the next section. You'll never run out of room in
Inkscape! (In fact, you can even get lost in the vastness of canvas;
to return to the page frame, just press the 5 key at any
time.)</p>
			<p>
				To the left of the canvas, there's the <em>main toolbox</em> (vertical). The buttons on
this toolbox activate various Inkscape tools. Each tool has its own purpose,
features, controls, keyboard shortcuts, mouse cursors, and other stuff. Some tools create
new objects, others edit them in various ways, and still others help you navigate in your
document. We'll briefly look at some of the tools in this chapter and explore them all
in detail in the rest of the book.</p>
			<p>
				Above the canvas is a horizontal toolbar called the <em>tool controls bar</em> (or simply the <em>controls bar</em>).
As its name implies, it
contains various options and controls for the currently
selected tool. Click some tool buttons on the left and watch the
contents of the controls bar change.</p>
			<p>
				At the top of the Inkscape window is a standard menu bar: <span class="ui">File</span>, <span class="ui">Edit</span>, <span class="ui">View</span>, and so on. Throughout the book, we will refer many times to commands and submenus in these menus (for example, <span class="ui">Edit<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Clone<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Unlink Clone</span>). To search through the menus, press the ? key to open the <em>command palette</em>.
Start typing to filter the list of all currently available commands or press the up arrow in the search field to access your command history (<a href="#fig2-6">Figure 2-6</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig2-6"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="02/command-palette.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 2-6: The menu and the command palette (after you press ?)</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="23"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_23" title="23"/>On the right-hand side, there are two more vertical toolbars. The <em>commands bar</em> is a regular
toolbar of the type you'll find in many programs. It has buttons for
actions such as <span class="ui">Save</span>, <span class="ui">Open</span>, <span class="ui">Undo</span>, and so on. The other toolbar,
still further right, is the snap controls bar where you can view and toggle any of the many snapping  options (<a href="c07.xhtml#section7.3">7.3</a>).</p>
			<p>
				Below the canvas, there's the <em>color palette</em>; it can be scrolled
horizontally by a scroll bar of its own. Further below, there's the <em>status bar</em>, a
bag of stuff whose components we will explore in detail later. For now, take note
of the <em>message area</em> of the status bar, which always displays some message relevant
to what you're doing at the moment. Pay attention to what the messages are saying; it may
save you a lot of time and frustration!</p>
			<p>
				Finally, Inkscape has a collection of <em>dialogs</em>, each devoted to a specific task.
You can place a dialog in a floating window or in one of the two static <em>docks</em> (initially empty) on
the left and right of the canvas (<a href="#fig2-7">Figure 2-7</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig2-7"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="02/dockui.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 2-7: Several dialogs in the static docks and in a floating window</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="24"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_24" title="24"/>Within each window or dock, dialogs can be overlaid as tabs or stacked
vertically. Simply drag each dialog's title tab to place it where you need it (a green frame appears where you can
drop a dialog). To move a dialog from a dock into a static window of its own, right-click its title and select <span class="ui"><strong>Move Tab to New Window</strong></span> or drag it away from the Inkscape window.
Inkscape remembers and restores the location and size of each dialog from the last time it was visible.</p>
			<p>
				To show or hide any of the elements of the interface (except the menu, the canvas, and
the docks), use commands in the <span class="ui"><strong>View<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Show/Hide</strong></span> submenu.
For the dialogs, whether docked or floating, use the convenient F12
key to hide or re-show all of the currently active dialogs.</p>
			<a id="section2.4"/><h2>2.4 Panning and Zooming</h2>
			<p>With an infinite vector canvas, the tools to move around that canvas as well as 
zoom in and out for a more convenient view are very important. Inkscape offers plenty 
of ways to pan (scroll) and zoom—enough to satisfy every taste.</p>
			<p>
				Of course, the canvas scroll bars work just fine to scroll the canvas—but they aren't all that convenient, so I usually hide them
by pressing  Ctrl-B. Instead, what I use most often is <em>middle-drag</em>.
Press the middle mouse button anywhere on the canvas and drag it in any
direction. Middle-drag works in any tool or mode.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>Most likely your mouse does not have a middle button as such; instead,
try to press (not roll) the wheel that most mice do have (between the left and right buttons). Usually,
you can click this wheel just as if it were a button. Of course, rotating the
wheel also works to scroll the canvas vertically;  rotating it while pressing Shift 
scrolls horizontally.</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>Pretty often, however, my right hand is on the keyboard, not the mouse. In that
case, the easiest way to scroll the canvas is by pressing
Ctrl-arrows. If you press and hold Ctrl-↑, for example, the canvas
starts scrolling downward (that is, your view starts going up), at first slowly but gradually accelerating. When you get the hang of
it, it feels very natural.</p>
			<p>Zooming in and out is also easy. With your keyboard, just press the plus + or
minus – keys to zoom in or out (unlike most other programs, use just
plain plus and minus keys, either on the main keyboard or on the keypad; you don't need
to press Ctrl or Shift with either). With your mouse,
middle-click to zoom in and Shift-middle-click to zoom out. Or, switch to the
Zoom tool where you can use regular left click to zoom in, Shift-left-click
to zoom out, or drag with the left mouse button to zoom into a rectangular area.</p>
			<p>
				For lots more zooming and panning information and tips, jump to <a href="c03.xhtml#section3.10">3.10</a>.</p>
				<a id="section2.5"/>
				<h2>2.5 Creating Objects</h2>
			<p>Now that you can navigate your way around the canvas, let's have a
closer look at the tools available for creating objects.</p>
			<p>
				Looking down the main toolbox, the first object-creating tool you see is the
Rectangle tool. This and the next four tools—Ellipse, Star, 3D Box, and Spiral—are
collectively called <em>shape tools</em>, and the objects they create are called <em>shapes</em> (<a href="#fig2-8">Figure 2-8</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig2-8"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="02/shapes.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 2-8: Playing with shape tools</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="25"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_25" title="25"/>A <em>shape</em> is a geometric object that you can not only move, scale, or rotate (as you
can any other object) but also edit in some ways specific to its type. For
example, with a rectangle, you can have its corners rounded; with an ellipse, you can turn it into a segment (pie-slice shape) or
elliptic arc; with a 3D box, you can move and resize it in its own 3D space. We will talk about shapes in <a href="c11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11</a>; for now, choose any of
the shape tools and start drawing on the canvas. Each mouse drag, from press to release
of the left mouse button, creates a new shape.</p>
			<p>
				Next down in the toolbox are the <em>Pen</em> and <em>Pencil</em> tools (<a href="#fig2-9">Figure 2-9</a>). Both create
arbitrary paths, but they do it differently. The Pencil tool works just like a real pencil—you
draw on the canvas, and it leaves behind a trace. (Note that the trace is not exact;
it's a bit smoothed out compared to the actual mouse trajectory.)</p>
			<a id="fig2-9"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="02/penpencil.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 2-9: Using the Pencil and Pen tools</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The Pen tool is more complex; it assumes that you understand how paths are
composed of nodes connected by linear or curved segments. For now, just click several times with this tool at different points
(this creates linear segments between click points), then click and drag a few times,
and finally press Enter to finish the path. Both Pencil and Pen by default create paths
with a thin black stroke but no fill. We'll discuss these tools in <a href="c14.xhtml#ch14">Chapter 14</a>.</p>
			<p><a id="26"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_26" title="26"/>The next two tools, <em>Calligraphic pen</em> and <em>Paint bucket</em>, also create paths, but unlike Pencil and Pen, they by
default produce filled paths without stroke (<a href="#fig2-10">Figure 2-10</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig2-10"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="02/calligbucket.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 2-10: Using the Calligraphic pen and Paint bucket tools</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The Calligraphic pen is one of the
most versatile tools in Inkscape; its many options and parameters allow it to imitate
not only a calligraphic pen (which was its original purpose), but also various brushes
and many other drawing implements and behaviors (some of which have no counterpart in
the real world). This is the primary tool of those who use Inkscape to <em>simply
draw</em> (<a href="c14.xhtml#ch14">Chapter 14</a>).</p>
			<p>The Paint bucket tool is also a great help for a cartoonist or
illustrator. Just as you'd expect, it fills in any bounded area,
creating a filled vector path. For practice, draw around a closed
area with several brush strokes of the Calligraphic pen, then click inside
with the Paint bucket. (If you click in an unbounded area, the tool will fail to fill 
it and say so in the status bar.)</p>
			<p>
				One last tool we'll look at is the <em>Text</em> tool that creates and edits text objects (<a href="#fig2-11">Figure 2-11</a>). Creating a new text object is
as simple as clicking anywhere and starting to type. Or, you can click and drag, in
which case you're creating a rectangular <em>flowed text</em> object that will automatically wrap when you type
up to the right edge.</p>
			<a id="fig2-11"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="02/text.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 2-11: Using the Text tool</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Editing an existing text object is just as easy—click it with the
Text tool to position the cursor and use the familiar text editing keys
(the arrow keys, Home, End, Delete, Enter for a new line, and so on). The Text tool
is the subject of <a href="c15.xhtml#ch15">Chapter 15</a>.</p>
			<p>
				Now, what if you need a raster object, such as a photo, in your SVG
document?  Instead of a tool, use the <span class="ui"><strong>Import</strong></span> command in the<span class="ui"><strong>File</strong></span> menu. Just select any raster image file (JPG, PNG, GIF, and TIFF all work),
and it will be inserted into your document. It will, however, remain a raster;
for ways to convert it to vector objects, see <a href="c18.xhtml#section18.7">18.7</a>.</p>
			<a id="section2.6"/><h2>
				2.6 <a id="27"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_27" title="27"/>Selecting</h2>
			<p>
				As you may have noticed, right after you've created a new object (for
example, with the Rectangle tool or Calligraphic pen), that object shows
a dashed frame around it. This frame indicates that the
object is <em>selected</em>.</p>
			<p>Selection is a fundamental concept in Inkscape. Almost all tools, commands, dialogs,
and shortcuts work on the object or objects that are currently selected. Various informational
displays, such as the status bar, always describe the selected objects. The ability to
select what you need quickly and precisely, as well as to figure out what is
currently selected, is vital for effective work in Inkscape.</p>
			<p>
				The main tool that allows you to select objects is called, appropriately enough,<em>Selector</em> (<a href="#fig2-12">Figure 2-12</a>). It is also the first (topmost) tool in the toolbox, because
selecting is so important. You can switch to this tool not only by clicking its button
but also by pressing either F1, S, or spacebar. You
really can't miss this tool!</p>
			<a id="fig2-12"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="02/selected.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 2-12: The Selector tool and a selected
object</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Basic selection with Selector is very easy (as is any other basic thing in
Inkscape). You just click any object and voilà, it's selected. Try it now. Watch
how the status bar message immediately updates to tell you what exactly you have
selected: a rectangle, a path, an ellipse, a text object, and so on.</p>
			<p>
				More than one object can be selected at any time, as shown in <a href="#fig2-13">Figure 2-13</a>. Usually, when you already have
something selected, clicking another object deselects the first. However, if you
Shift-click an unselected object, you <em>add</em> it to the list of
selected objects. (If you Shift-click an already selected object, you will<em>remove</em> it from selection.) Note what the status bar says about your new
selection. Note also how each of the selected objects has its own dashed frame.</p>

			<p><a id="28"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_28" title="28"/>Want to select 1,000 objects at once? No need to Shift-click 1,000 times. With
Selector, just <em>drag</em> (press the mouse button and move the mouse without releasing
the button) across all the objects you want to select. You will see a rectangular<em>rubber band</em> that follows your mouse. When you release the mouse, all objects that are
completely inside the rubber band will become selected, as shown in <a href="#fig2-14">Figure 2-14</a>.</p>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				You can select by using keyboard shortcuts, too. The Tab key has the
generic meaning of "going to the next one"—so in Inkscape,
pressing Tab selects the next object (in z-order, <a href="c04.xhtml#section4.4">4.4</a>, which,
unless you change it, is the same as order of
creation), whereas Shift-Tab selects the previous object. The familiar
Ctrl-A, which in many programs means <em>select all</em>, also works as expected.</p>
			<p>Need a different selection? Deselect anything you have selected by pressing
Escape or by clicking anywhere on the empty canvas (not on an object).</p>
			<p>That's just a fraction of all the selection methods and techniques Inkscape offers,
but it should be enough to get you started. Let's move on to actually changing what we have
selected.</p>
			<a id="section2.7"/><h2>2.7 Transforming</h2>
			<p>
				The other function of the Selector tool, apart from selecting objects, is<em>transforming</em> them.</p>
			<p>
				Transforming is simply an umbrella term for <em>moving</em>, <em>scaling</em>
(resizing), <em>rotating</em>, and <em>skewing</em>. The first two of these—and especially
moving—are very common in vector work because it's nearly impossible to create
objects that are at once in the exact place and with the exact size you need. You will find
yourself moving things around all the time, so learn how to do
this quickly and precisely.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>
				</div>
				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>
						All four transformation modes treat an object<em>as a whole</em>. By transforming, you can move, squeeze, rotate, or skew the entire
object, but you cannot move one part of the object relative to the other parts; that's
a task for other tools. For example, if the nose in your
drawing of a face is a separate object, you can make it larger on the face using nothing
but the Selector tool. But if the nose is part of the same object as the rest of the
face, you will need to use other tools (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.5.7.2">12.5.7.2</a>) to make the nose larger without also changing the
face.</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p><em>Moving</em> the selection using the Selector tool is simple—just drag any of the
selected objects with your mouse. If you have more than one object selected, dragging
any of them moves them all together.</p>
			<p><a id="29"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_29" title="29"/>One very common operation is <em>duplicating</em> objects, or making an exact copy of
the selection. To do this, press Ctrl-D; a copy is created and placed exactly
over the original selection (which, therefore, apparently does not change). Just drag it away with the
Selector tool to where you want to place the copy. You can also use the traditional copy-and-paste 
method of duplicating objects (Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V).</p>
			<p>
				Other types of transforming are a little more difficult. Whenever you
have anything selected, the selection is surrounded by eight arrow
marks (<a href="#fig2-15">Figure 2-15</a>). Dragging any of these arrow marks performs <em>scaling</em>. This is how you
make your selection larger or smaller, taller or wider, and so on. The four corner arrows can move
in any direction to resize the selected objects freely; the four center arrows scale in one
direction only (the top and bottom center marks move vertically; the left and
right center ones move horizontally).</p>
			<a id="fig2-15"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="02/scaling.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 2-15: Scaling objects</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				For the remaining two transformation modes, <em>rotate</em> and <em>skew</em>, click anywhere on
an already selected object (or, alternatively, press Shift-S). The arrow marks change—now your selection is in
the <em>rotate mode</em>, not the <em>scale mode</em> we used before (<a href="#fig2-16">Figure 2-16</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig2-16"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="02/rotating.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 2-16: Rotating and skewing objects</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="30"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_30" title="30"/>Now,
dragging any of the four corner arrows rotates the selection around its
center, while the four center arrows skew the selection. Also, in rotate mode, you can still
move your selection around by dragging. To go back to the scale mode,
click the selection or press Shift-S again. Next time
you select these or other objects, they will again be in the scale mode first.</p>
			<p>If you prefer to control Inkscape from the keyboard, you won't be
surprised to learn that the four arrow keys each move the
selection in the corresponding direction. Less obviously, the
left and right angle brackets (&lt; and &gt;) scale the selection down and
up, correspondingly, while the square brackets ([ and
]) rotate it counterclockwise and clockwise, correspondingly. There are no shortcuts for skewing objects.</p>
			<p>This should get you started with basic transformations of objects with the Selector tool. Again, there
are many more tricks, shortcuts, and rules of thumb that we'll discuss later, but for
now, this should provide a general feel for how Inkscape works.</p>
			<a id="section2.8"/><h2>2.8 Styling</h2>
			<p>
				Any object in Inkscape has style. <em>Style</em> is a complex
concept that includes many separate properties, from the color
of the fill to the width of the stroke to complex SVG filters
that totally alter the way an object looks. Here are just a few of the simplest and most common techniques for changing the style of objects.</p>
			<p>
				First of all, you should have guessed by now that the style-changing actions, as any
other actions in Inkscape, apply to the <em>current selection</em>. That is, before you
change the style of something, you must first select that something.</p>
			<p>
				Once you select the object or objects you want to style, the simplest thing to
do is click the color palette at the bottom of the canvas. The
color you click becomes the new fill color of all selected
objects (<a href="#fig2-17">Figure 2-17</a>). Even if an object had no fill at all (like a path created
with the Pencil tool), it becomes filled with that color too. (Note
that you can scroll the palette to the right to see more colors than
fit the screen.)</p>
			<a id="fig2-17"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="02/fillstroke.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 2-17: Setting fill or stroke from the color palette</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>You can just as easily change the stroke color of the selected
objects—simply Shift-click instead of clicking a color. Again,
if some objects had no stroke, they will get it now.</p>
			<p>
				Next, look at the complex control in the lower-left corner of your Inkscape
window, on the left end of the status bar. This control (shown in <a href="#fig2-18">Figure 2-18</a>) is called the <em>selected style
indicator</em>; in accordance with its name, it indicates the style<a id="31"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_31" title="31"/>(or rather, the most important style properties; there's
much more to an object's style than shown in this indicator) of the selection. That's where you
look to check the fill and stroke colors of  selected objects.</p>
			<a id="fig2-18"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="02/ssi.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 2-18: Selected style indicator</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				This indicator also allows you to change the style properties it displays. One very
common operation is <em>removing</em> the fill or stroke from selected objects. Just
middle-click the <span class="ui"><strong>Fill</strong></span> (top) or <span class="ui"><strong>Stroke</strong></span> (bottom) swatch to do this, or
right-click the corresponding swatch and choose <span class="ui"><strong>Remove</strong></span> from the pop-up menu. Note that
an object with no fill and no stroke is completely invisible—you can't see it and you
can't click it to select (although you can drag the rubber band <em>around</em> it to select
it).</p>
			<p>
				Apart from the fill and stroke colors, one important style property is<em>opacity</em>. Think of stained glass that has its own color but still shows through
whatever is behind it; this is how objects with less-than-100% opacity behave in
Inkscape. (Obviously, an opacity of 0% makes an object invisible.) To change opacity,
use the <span class="ui"><strong>O:</strong></span> control in the selected style indicator. Try selecting an object
that is on top of other objects and type in a different opacity value; notice how the object becomes
semitransparent (<a href="#fig2-19">Figure 2-19</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig2-19"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="02/opacity.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 2-19: Changing opacity</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				If you just want two objects to have the same style, it's easy to do. Select the
first object and press Ctrl-C; this places a copy of the object on the
clipboard. Then select the other object (or objects) and paste the <em>style</em> of the
clipboard object onto them by pressing Shift-Ctrl-V. This is the easiest way to make
multiple objects look the same.</p>
			<a id="section2.9"/><h2>2.9 Saving and Exporting</h2>
			<p>Suppose you've 
created something in Inkscape that you would like to share with
others. What is the best way to go about it?</p>
			<p><em>Saving</em> a document as SVG works as expected. Just press Ctrl-S
or choose <span class="ui"><strong>File<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Save</strong></span> from the menu, navigate to the folder, type the filename,
and click <span class="ui"><strong>Save</strong></span>.</p>
			<p><a id="32"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_32" title="32"/>As far as sharing goes, SVG isn't a bad format at all; for example, as already
mentioned, you can view it, in all its vector glory, in any modern browser.
However, for any number of reasons, SVG may not be
a viable choice in your situation. In that case, you need to <em>export</em> your document
to some other format. Go to the <span class="ui"><strong>Save</strong></span> dialog again. Note the drop-down list
displaying <em>Inkscape SVG (*.svg)</em>; check out what else is
available. Quite a lot, in fact!  More than 20 different vector formats are
listed.</p>
			<p>Don't get overexcited, though. Several of these formats are just variations upon the
primary Inkscape SVG format (such as plain SVG or compressed SVG). Others are 
limited in various ways, either because the target format is itself limited compared to
SVG, or because Inkscape's exporter for that format is less than fully developed, or
both. These export formats are usable, but only if you know what the limitations are and
design your documents with these limitations in mind.</p>
			<p>
				Perhaps the safest export format, besides SVG, is PDF (<a href="b02.xhtml#chB">Appendix B</a>). It still cannot fully preserve
some SVG features (such as filters, which are by default rasterized), 
but for most Inkscape documents, it should be perfectly adequate. The
biggest advantage of PDF, apart from its being a vector format, is that it is
supported by a much wider range of software than just the canonical Adobe Acrobat.</p>
			<p>
				As you may have noticed, the <span class="ui">Save</span> dialog only lists vector formats
for export. What about exporting to raster? This is done in a different dialog
called <span class="ui">Export PNG Image</span> (<a href="c18.xhtml#section18.6.1">18.6.1</a>).  As its name suggests, the only raster format Inkscape can export is PNG.
In most cases, though, it's not a problem; PNG is universally supported (viewable in all browsers), supports
full RGB color and gradual (alpha) transparency, and is just a nice
all-around  all-purpose format perfectly suitable for renditions of any vector artwork. If you
really need JPG, GIF, or TIFF, you can use any number of specialized tools for
converting your image from PNG.</p>
			<p>
				Open the dialog by pressing Shift-Ctrl-E or choosing<span class="ui"><strong>File<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Export PNG Image</strong></span> (<a href="c18.xhtml#fig18-22">Figure 18-22</a>).
At the top of the dialog, there are four buttons for choosing<em>what</em> to export. If you drew your image paying respect to the page frame that
now nicely enframes your art, select <span class="ui"><strong>Page</strong></span>. Otherwise, select <span class="ui"><strong>Drawing</strong></span>
to make the export area cover all the objects of your drawing no matter where they
are. You can also export only the current selection or specify a custom export area.</p>
			<p>
				Then, set either the desired pixel size of your raster image or its resolution
(these two values are obviously related: increasing one increases the
other, and vice versa). Finally, type the
export filename (or use <span class="ui"><strong>Export As</strong></span> to select location and filename) and click <span class="ui"><strong>Export</strong></span>.
(After exporting, the dialog remains open so you can use it over and over; this kind of workflow is explored in <a href="c18.xhtml#section18.6.1">18.6.1</a>.)</p>
			<p>You're done! Take your saved or exported file and send it out into the
world.</p>
			<a id="section2.10"/><h2>2.10 A Final Example</h2>
			<p>
				Let's apply what we have learned so far to create a slightly more complex illustration: a
silly, <em>South Park</em>–style boy's face. This isn't much of a challenge, of course, but it
should be useful for digesting all the new knowledge you've acquired.</p>
			<p><a id="33"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_33" title="33"/>To start, run a new Inkscape instance, or press Ctrl-N to create a new empty document if you're
already running Inkscape.</p>
			<p>
				Choose the Ellipse tool and draw an ellipse (<a href="#fig2-20">Figure 2-20</a>). That will be the boy's
head. Scroll the palette at the bottom, choose a suitable body color, and
click it to assign it to the ellipse. (You can try several colors
until you find the best one.) If the ellipse came up with a stroke,
middle-click the <span class="ui"><strong>Stroke</strong></span> swatch in the lower-left corner of the
status bar to remove it.</p>
			<a id="fig2-20"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="02/boy1.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 2-20: One ellipse</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Draw a smaller ellipse on top of the head ellipse. What's going on—is it invisible?!
No. Ellipse (like most other tools) simply remembered the color you assigned to the head
and now used the same color for the new ellipse, so it appears merged into the
background of the larger head ellipse (although you can still see its selection frame and handles).
Scroll the palette back to the left and click the white color swatch to
see the smaller ellipse (<a href="#fig2-21">Figure 2-21</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig2-21"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="02/boy2.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 2-21: Two ellipses</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				This smaller ellipse is supposed to be the white of the boy's eye. It's probably not
exactly the size you want the eye to be and is in a funny place for an eye. Switch to
the Selector tool and drag the small ellipse to approximately where you want it. Then
drag one of the arrow marks at the corners to make it approximately the right
size (<a href="#fig2-22">Figure 2-22</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig2-22"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="02/boy3.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 2-22: Positioning the second ellipse</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="34"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_34" title="34"/>Now you need yet another ellipse for the pupil of the eye. Instead of
going back to the Ellipse tool, however, let's use
duplication. With the white ellipse still selected, press
Ctrl-D. Nothing visibly changed, but you now
have two ellipses there, the new one being selected. Click the
black color swatch, then drag the arrow marks to make the
pupil smaller and drag it into place, as shown in <a href="#fig2-23">Figure 2-23</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig2-23"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="02/boy4.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 2-23: Head and one eye</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The eye is ready—but you need two identical eyes (<a href="#fig2-24">Figure 2-24</a>). Let's duplicate
the entire eye you just created. The eye consists of two separate objects,
so before duplicating you need to select them both. To do this,
we either drag a rubber band around the eye (make sure to start
dragging from an empty space and not from the head ellipse;
otherwise, the head will be dragged, which is not what you want!),
or just click the pupil and then
Shift-click the white. Press Ctrl-D and
drag the second eye sideways (both objects move when any of
them is dragged).</p>

				<img alt="" src="02/boy5.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 2-24: Head and two eyes</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Now, to finish the drawing, choose the Calligraphic pen tool and draw the
nose, mouth, ear, and some hair (<a href="#fig2-25">Figure 2-25</a>). If the paths appear in some wrong
color, click black on the palette; after that, all new calligraphic
paths will be black too. If the pen draws too wide or too thin,
adjust the <span class="ui"><strong>Width</strong></span> value on the tool's controls bar above the
canvas. If something goes wrong, press
Ctrl-Z to undo.</p>
			<a id="fig2-25"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="02/boy6.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 2-25: Welcome to the world!</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="35"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_35" title="35"/>The image is ready, but we're not finished yet with all the possibilities it
offers. What you have done so far would be just as easy to do in a raster editor. But we're
in vector—so let's use the specific vector advantages to play with the result. Using
Selector, select the whites of both eyes and scale them up or down. Or move the pupils
around. Or scale, rotate, and move the mouth. This creates a wide range of facial
expressions. Let's select, duplicate, and drag away the entire drawing to present
several examples side by side, as shown in <a href="#fig2-26">Figure 2-26</a>.</p>

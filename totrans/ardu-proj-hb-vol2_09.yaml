- en: An LED, or *light-emitting diode*, is a small bulb that emits light when a low
    current is passed through it. It has two legs, the longer of which is the positive
    connection. LEDs generally require a resistor or they may burn out. LEDs are polarized,
    meaning current flows only in one direction.

- en: Resistors restrict the amount of current that can flow through a circuit to
    prevent components from overloading. A resistor looks like a cylinder with colored
    bands and a wire extending from each end. The resistance value is indicated by
    a color code—see “[Decoding Resistor Values](app02.xhtml#ch00lev1sec175)” on [page
    250](app02.xhtml#page_250) for more details. Check the value carefully, as it
    can be easy to choose the wrong one. Resistors come in four-, five-, and six-band
    varieties, so be aware that, for example, a four-band 220-ohm resistor can look
    slightly different from a five-band resistor of the same value.

- en: In most of the projects in this book we’ve used *resistors*. Resistors are electrical
    components that limit the amount of current allowed through a circuit (measured
    in ohms). They are used to protect components, like LEDs, from overloading and
    burning out. The value of a resistor is identified by colored bands on the body.
    Resistors can have four, five, or six colored bands.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's important to be able to determine the value of a resistor so that you know
    you’re using the correct one in your project. Let’s try to determine the value
    of the four-band resistor shown in [Figure B-1](app02.xhtml#chBfig1).

    that the actual value can be up to 5 percent more or less than 1 kilohm. We can
    do the same calculation for a five- or six-band resistor.

    band on the right.

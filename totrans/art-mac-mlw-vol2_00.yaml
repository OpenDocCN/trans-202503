    continue to flourish year over year,^([1](#fm8-1)) while industry reports predict
    that Mac will become the dominant platform in enterprise environments.^([2](#fm8-2))
    As Apple’s share of the global computer market grows, Macs have become an ever-more
    compelling target for opportunistic hackers and malware authors. Some studies
    have even found, on average, more threats and malware on Mac systems than on Windows
    ones.^([3](#fm8-3))

- en: When it comes to protecting Macs and their users, analyzing malware (the topic
    of *The Art of Mac Malware*, Volume 1) is only half the battle. Detecting malicious
    code in the first place is the other, perhaps even more important, piece. There
    are many approaches to detecting malicious code, each with pros and cons. At one
    end of the detection spectrum, we can leverage databases of malware signatures.
    By scanning binaries for sequences of malicious bytes, we can efficiently identify
    known threats. However, we fail to detect new malware or variants. This downside
    is troublesome. To see why, consider the case of the malware known as FruitFly.
    Carefully crafted by a single programmer and deployed in a highly targeted manner,
    it remained undetected for over a decade, as no antivirus program contained a
    signature to detect it. The malware spied on unknowing victims using Macs’ mics
    and webcams, leading to damaging real-life consequences.^([4](#fm8-4))

    which focus on a malicious program’s actions or impact on a system. To understand
    this approach, consider the last time you were sick. Perhaps your illness started
    with a runny nose, a headache, a sore throat, or a stomachache. While you probably
    didn’t know exactly what pathogen had infected you, your body’s symptoms indicated
    that you were no longer your normal, healthy self. We can use a similar strategy
    to generically and heuristically detect digital pathogens: by looking for symptoms
    and anomalies.'

    they interact with a system. Some, such as the spawning of a newly persisted unsigned
    process, may be easy to detect. Others, like the surreptitious planting of a trojanized
    dynamic library or a covert exfiltration channel, are more subtle. Regardless,
    if we can programmatically detect these behaviors, we should be able to ascertain
    whether a system is infected and, by identifying the responsible process, pinpoint
    the infection.

- en: Of course, the heuristic-based detection approach has some downsides. While
    it should be able to pinpoint any malicious item on a system, it likely won’t
    be able to identify the specific malware strain. For example, it should notice
    an unauthorized program surreptitiously accessing the mic or webcam, but it won’t
    know whether the responsible process is the malware FruitFly. Is this a significant
    downside? I don’t believe so, as the malware responsible for the infection may
    be unknown anyway, and you can always deploy a signature-based detection engine
    to cover the known basics.

  zh: 当然，基于启发式的检测方法也有一些缺点。虽然它应该能够识别系统中的任何恶意项，但它可能无法识别具体的恶意软件类型。例如，它应该能够注意到一个未经授权的程序偷偷访问麦克风或摄像头，但它不会知道负责该进程的是否是恶意软件FruitFly。这是一个重大的缺点吗？我认为不是，因为负责感染的恶意软件可能本来就未知，而且你始终可以部署一个基于签名的检测引擎来覆盖已知的基础问题。
- en: Another challenge is that heuristic-based detections can suffer from false positives.
    For example, malware authors often leverage executable packers to obfuscate their
    malicious creations, but so could legitimate software developers. Thus, no heuristic-based
    detection approach should focus on a single heuristic when attempting to classify
    an item as malicious. Instead, the detection should always look for multiple anomalous
    behaviors and leverage approaches that reduce false positives, such as code signing
    information, before flagging something as suspicious or likely malicious. If you
    have the luxury to do so, you could enlist a human to validate any flagged items.

  zh: 另一个挑战是基于启发式的检测可能会受到误报的影响。例如，恶意软件作者通常利用可执行的打包程序来混淆他们的恶意作品，但合法的软件开发者也可能如此。因此，任何基于启发式的检测方法在试图将某个项目分类为恶意时，都不应该只依赖单一的启发式规则。相反，检测应该始终寻找多个异常行为，并利用减少误报的方法，比如代码签名信息，才会将某些项目标记为可疑或可能是恶意的。如果条件允许，你可以让人工来验证任何被标记的项目。

    of malware will require internet access to fully function (for example, to communicate
    with a command-and-control server for tasking), so you should connect your machine

- en: Before performing any analysis, make sure to disable any sharing between the
    virtual machine and the base system. For example, it would be rather unfortunate
    to run a ransomware sample only to find that it has also encrypted any shared
    files on your host system. Virtual machines also offer options for networking,
    such as host-only and bridged. The former will exclusively allow network connections
    with the host, which may be useful in various analysis situations, such as when
    you’re setting up a local command-and-control server.

- en: I noted that the ability to revert a virtual machine to its original state can
    greatly speed up malware analysis by allowing you to return to earlier stages
    in the analysis process. You should always take a snapshot before you begin your
    analysis so you can bring the virtual machine back to a known clean slate when
    you’re done. During your analysis session, you should also make judicious use
    of snapshots. For example, take a snapshot immediately prior to allowing the malware
    to execute some core logic. If the malware fails to perform the expected action
    (perhaps because it detected one of your analysis tools and prematurely exited),
    or if your analysis tools failed to gather the data required for your analysis,
    simply revert to the snapshot, make any necessary changes to your analysis environment
    or tools, and then allow the malware to re-execute. On dedicated analysis machines
    or virtual machines that don’t support snapshots, APFS snapshots are likely your
    best bet.

- en: The main drawback to the virtual machine analysis approach is that malware may
    contain logic to thwart virtual machines. If the malware can successfully detect
    that it’s being virtualized, it will often exit in an attempt to avoid continued
    analysis. See Chapter 9 of *The Art of Mac Malware*, Volume 1, for approaches
    to identifying and overcoming this logic.

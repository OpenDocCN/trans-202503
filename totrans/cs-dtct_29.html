<p class="noindent">Notation was waiting in the hall when Frank emerged from the captain’s office. “How’d it go?” she asked the moment he shut the door.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Well enough,” said Frank. “He didn’t yell, and I’ve got another three months’ rent for my office.” He held up a small bag of coins.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“That’s it?” asked Notation, her voice laced with disappointment.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“What were you expecting?” asked Frank. “A commendation? They don’t give commendations to private eyes. But I hear you got one, and a promotion. Well done, Detective Notation. It’s quite a step up.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notation blushed. “Thank you,” she said. “But what about you? I thought . . . maybe . . .”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“You thought the captain would ask me to come back,” Frank filled in. “In fact, he tells me you recommended it.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notation turned a bright shade of red. “You’re a skilled detective,” she said.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank laughed. “He didn’t offer me a job.” Seeing the look on Notation’s face, he added, “Don’t take it personally. He was never going to offer me a spot on the force again. The captain and I have a long history, longer than a single case can erase. Anyway, the private eye life suits me better.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_238"/>“So you just go back to . . .”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Hunting someone’s lost dragon?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Yeah,” said Notation. “That.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“As a matter of fact, I’ve been presented with a new opportunity.” He held up his hand to stop her before she could get too excited, and added, “As an independent contractor.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“What is it?” asked Notation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“It appears there’s a league of wizards out there, trying to free Exponentious and take over the kingdom.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notation smiled. “I’m familiar with them. I seem to recall that I recently helped arrest one of their more active members.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“One of their more active members, yes, and dedicated members, for sure. But it’s possible that he was also one of the less capable members. Princess Ann is concerned that Socks’s attempted prison break will inspire some of the league’s more senior and competent members.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“So you’re investigating the League of Unnecessary Complexity? As an independent contractor, of course.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank nodded. “It’s a tough search problem—find all the members of a secret evil organization. But it just so happens that search problems are my specialty.”</p>&#13;

- en: Welcome to the world of locksport! We’re excited to have you join the global
    family of people who see locks as a puzzle to be solved. It is our sincere hope
    that you find our hobby as entertaining as we do, and that one day you might join
    us at a local meetup or even an international competition!

- en: This section will provide you with a strong foundation on which to build your
    lock-opening skills. We’ll start with a look at where locksport began, as well
    as current groups you can join and the locksport rules and local laws you should
    be aware of as you get started. From there, we’ll cover what makes a lock click,
    components of locks that make them harder or easier to pick, and finally, how
    to disassemble, reassemble, and care for the locks in your collection. It’s going
    to be a fun ride; let’s get going!

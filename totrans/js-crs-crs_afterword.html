<p class="INTROTNI2">You’ve learned the core of the JavaScript language, you’ve worked through the book’s three projects, and you’re wondering what to do now. The good news (or the bad news, depending on your outlook) is that the learning never stops. There are many different directions in which you can take your programming career. Here are some suggestions about possible next steps and tools and resources to explore.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="sec1" epub:type="division">
<h2 class="H1" id="sec1"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Projects</samp></h2>
<p class="TNI1">You should have a fairly good understanding of how to set up a new JavaScript project at this point, so why not try building something new? One option would be to make your own game, using the techniques you learned <span aria-label=" Page 330. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_330" role="doc-pagebreak"/>in this book. Some relatively simple arcade games in a similar vein to <i>Pong</i> include <i>Snake</i>, <i>Space Invaders</i>, <i>Tetris</i>, and <i>Breakout</i>. Or you could try something completely different and make a word game, like <i>Wordle</i> or <i>Hangman</i>.</p>
<p class="TX">You could also try to build on what you learned in the book’s other projects by making your own musical creation or data visualization. On the music side, you might want to experiment with making a drum machine, or perhaps an endless music generator. You could also use your knowledge to add sound effects to one of your games. On the data visualization side, there are countless other APIs you can try out for fetching data from other services. As discussed in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a></span>, many APIs require some sort of authentication, which isn’t feasible for browser-based applications; with Node.js, however, you can experiment with building your own backend applications as well.</p>
<p class="TX">Of course, you shouldn’t feel limited to the sorts of projects you worked through in this book. If there’s something that interests you, try to build it! If you’re not sure where to start, use Google to get some ideas. JavaScript is one of the most popular languages in the world, so chances are somebody has written up instructions on doing whatever it is you want to do.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="sec2" epub:type="division">
<h2 class="H1" id="sec2"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Node.js</samp></h2>
<p class="TNI1">This book only explains how to write JavaScript for running in web browsers, but with Node.js you can also run JavaScript on backend web servers. Check out <a href="https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/"><i>https://<wbr/>nodejs<wbr/>.dev<wbr/>/en<wbr/>/learn<wbr/>/</i></a> for a great guide to getting started with Node.js. Once you have a backend for your app, you can start to do more interesting things, such as storing data on the user’s behalf, accessing third-party authenticated HTTP APIs with a secret key, and much more.</p>
</section>
<section aria-labelledby="sec3" epub:type="division">
<h2 class="H1" id="sec3"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Tools</samp></h2>
<p class="TNI1">There are many tools of various kinds that will help you as you continue your programming journey. This section introduces a few of them, but it’s in no way comprehensive.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="sec4" epub:type="division">
<h3 class="H2" id="sec4"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Git</samp></h3>
<p class="TNI1">Git is a popular version control system that allows you to keep track of changes to your code and go back to earlier versions. When I first started programming, I would often find myself making changes to my code and breaking something, then not understanding how I had broken it and not being able to get back to the previous state. To avoid that, I started making backups of my code so I could go back to an earlier version. Git is a much better way to achieve the same goal. With Git, you make <i>commits</i> that store the state of your code at a particular point in time. Each commit builds on previous ones, while keeping track of what’s changed.</p>
<p class="TX">There are a lot of online resources for learning Git. Many of them can be found at <a href="https://git-scm.com/doc"><i>https://<wbr/>git<wbr/>-scm<wbr/>.com<wbr/>/doc</i></a>.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="sec5" epub:type="division">
<h3 class="H2" id="sec5"><span aria-label=" Page 331. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_331" role="doc-pagebreak"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">GitHub</samp></h3>
<p class="TNI1">Once you have Git installed on your computer, using GitHub (the service from which we drew our data in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter15.xhtml">Chapter 15</a></span>) is a great next step. GitHub provides a way to upload and share your local Git repositories so they can be accessed anywhere.</p>
<p class="TX">GitHub also gives you access to millions of open source repositories that you can <i>fork</i> (make your own copy of) and modify to your heart’s content. For example, to see all my public repositories, go to <a href="https://github.com/skilldrick"><i>https://<wbr/>github<wbr/>.com<wbr/>/skilldrick</i></a>.</p>

<section aria-labelledby="sec6" epub:type="division">
<h3 class="H2" id="sec6"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">CodePen</samp></h3>
<p class="TNI1">To share your projects with others, you’ll need a way to make them accessible via the web. You could set up your own web hosting, but a much easier option is using CodePen (<a href="https://codepen.io"><i>https://<wbr/>codepen<wbr/>.io</i></a>). This is also the tool used for hosting the companion resources for this book, available at <a href="https://codepen.io/collection/ZMjYLO"><i>https://<wbr/>codepen<wbr/>.io<wbr/>/collection<wbr/>/ZMjYLO</i></a>.</p>
<p class="TX">With CodePen, you can create and share projects built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The code is all viewable on the page in separate panels. For example, <a href="#figA-1">Figure A-1</a> shows a sample Pen I put together that adds an extra exclamation mark every time you click the text. Check out the Pen online at <a href="https://codepen.io/skilldrick/pen/abKaQpo"><i>https://<wbr/>codepen<wbr/>.io<wbr/>/skilldrick<wbr/>/pen<wbr/>/abKaQpo</i></a>.</p>

<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure A-1: A sample Pen on CodePen</samp></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="TX">In the HTML panel, only the contents of the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">body</span> element are needed. CodePen supplies the rest of the HTML structure automatically. You can also easily include external JavaScript libraries through the Settings dialog.</p>

<p class="TNI1">Like CodePen, Glitch is a service that hosts your code for you and lets you share it with the world. What sets Glitch apart is its ability to run frontend <i>and</i> backend code. Instead of just providing panels for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Glitch allows you to define a full directory structure with all the files you need. You can even add a SQLite database to store data. Go to <a href="https://glitch.com"><i>https://<wbr/>glitch<wbr/>.com</i></a> to learn more, or check out <a href="https://glitch.new"><i>https://<wbr/>glitch<wbr/>.new</i></a> to choose from a list of starter apps.</p>

<h2 class="H1" id="sec8"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Web Development</samp></h2>
<p class="TNI1">Although this book’s focus is on JavaScript, along the way you also learned some general web development skills. If this has whetted your appetite, you may want to spend some more time learning about other aspects of web development.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="sec9" epub:type="division">
<h3 class="H2" id="sec9"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">HTML and CSS</samp></h3>
<p class="TNI1">HTML is the language that the vast majority of web pages are written in, so it’s valuable to have a deeper understanding of its intricacies. To learn more, check out the MDN docs at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/HTML"><i>https://<wbr/>developer<wbr/>.mozilla<wbr/>.org<wbr/>/HTML</i></a>. CSS is used for styling web pages, so if you want your pages to look nice, it’s essential to understand how it works.

<h3 class="H2" id="sec10"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries</samp></h3>
<p class="TNI1">Web development today is very complex, with web apps regularly containing thousands of lines of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To greatly reduce the amount of code needed to write a fully functional modern web app, many developers use JavaScript frameworks and libraries. Two of the most popular at the time of this writing are React and Vue.js. Knowledge of such tools isn’t necessary, but it can dramatically simplify the process of building complex websites and frontend applications. You can try out React and Vue.js in CodePen, or check out their websites:</p>

<h2 class="H1" id="sec11"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Testing</samp></h2>
<p class="TNI1">One essential tool for programmers is an automated testing framework. Automated tests are designed to run against your code regularly, to confirm it does what you expect it to do. A common problem when writing code is <span aria-label=" Page 333. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_333" role="doc-pagebreak"/>adding a new feature without realizing that the change breaks some other aspect of your program. By writing good tests and running them regularly, you can identify the moment something breaks, and fix it. You can also work on large refactors of your code with confidence, knowing that as long as the tests pass, it’s unlikely that you’ve broken anything.</p>
<p class="TX">There are a huge number of testing libraries and frameworks for JavaScript. One of the most popular at the time of this writing is Jest: check it out at <a href="https://jestjs.io"><i>https://<wbr/>jestjs<wbr/>.io</i></a>.</p>

<h2 class="H1" id="sec12"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">More JavaScript!</samp></h2>
<p class="TNI1">If you want to deepen your JavaScript knowledge, there are many resources available to you. Here are a few recommendations of where to get started:</p>
<ul class="ul">

<h2 class="H1" id="sec13"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Other Languages</samp></h2>
<p class="TNI1">You might decide at this point that you want to broaden your programming knowledge rather than dig deeper into JavaScript. Go for it! Every language you learn gives you valuable insights into programming in general, so this is actually a great way to get better at JavaScript.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="sec14" epub:type="division">
<h3 class="H2" id="sec14"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">TypeScript</samp></h3>
<p class="TNI1">One of the problems that people have with JavaScript is its weak, dynamic typing, which allows values to be implicitly coerced to different data types depending on the surrounding code. For example, the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">+</span> operator will convert a number operand to a string if the other operand is a string, while the <span class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">-</span> operator will convert a string operand to a number if the other operand is a number.</p>
<p class="TX">The TypeScript language is an attempt to add static typing to JavaScript. <i>Static typing</i> means that a variable of a certain type can only contain values of that type, and conversions between types must be explicit. TypeScript is syntactically a superset of JavaScript, which means that a valid JavaScript program is also a valid TypeScript program. TypeScript code can be converted to JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler.</p>
<p class="TX">Using static types makes it impossible to write code with certain bugs. For example, in JavaScript you might take a value from a text box, assume that it’s a number, and add it to another number. Unfortunately, any value from a text box is treated as a string, so the other number will be implicitly converted to a string as well, and you’ll end up with the two strings <span aria-label=" Page 334. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_334" role="doc-pagebreak"/>concatenated. TypeScript doesn’t allow this. It knows that the value from the text box is a string, and it forces you to decide whether you want to convert both operands to strings for concatenation or convert both operands to numbers for addition.</p>
<p class="TX">The downside of TypeScript is that it can sometimes be more difficult to write code that otherwise seems like it should work. This is sometimes known as <i>fighting the compiler</i>.</p>
<p class="TX">If you’d like to learn more, here are some books and other resources that can help you get started with TypeScript:</p>

<h3 class="H2" id="sec15"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Python</samp></h3>
<p class="TNI1">Python is a scripting language, like JavaScript, but it has a different philosophy. The language takes a “batteries included” approach, meaning that its standard library comes fully featured with a wide array of functionality (JavaScript’s standard library, by comparison, is very limited). Like JavaScript, Python is dynamically typed, so the same variable can hold values of different data types. But whereas JavaScript is weakly typed, Python is <i>strongly typed</i>, meaning that there are no implicit coercions. Syntactically, Python looks very different, using indentation (which is required, not optional) rather than braces to define nested blocks of code.</p>
<p class="TX">Python is a popular language of choice for web servers, as well as for scientific and numeric programming. If you’re looking to broaden your skills, it’s a good choice. The following book (in the same series as <i>JavaScript Crash Course</i>) is a great introduction to the language, and its projects highlight some of the areas in which Python shines:</p>

<h3 class="H2" id="sec16"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Rust</samp></h3>
<p class="TNI1">One of the languages I’m most excited about today is Rust. Like TypeScript, it’s a statically typed language, but it has a much more powerful type system than most languages in use today. Rust aims to replace the older languages C and C<span class="symbol">++</span> for developing high-performance code.</p>
<p class="TX">C and C<span class="symbol">++</span> are both languages without <i>garbage collection</i>, the process that tells the computer which values and objects are no longer used, in order to free up the computer’s memory. Instead, C/C<span class="symbol">++</span> programmers must manually free data that is no longer in use—a process that’s error prone and can often lead to bugs. These languages are commonly used in performance-critical environments, and they don’t use garbage collection because it can reduce the performance of software. Rust avoids this problem with a <span aria-label=" Page 335. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_335" role="doc-pagebreak"/>compile-time <i>borrow checker</i>, which keeps track of which objects are in use at any given time, and by which parts of the program.</p>
<p class="TX">Rust is also used heavily as a source language for compiling to WebAssembly, which is an exciting new technology for running extremely efficient and performant code in the browser. Here are some resources for learning more:</p>
<ul class="ul">

- en: Frank spent the night alternately reviewing clues, watching out the windows
    for Vinettee thugs, and bemoaning the safe house’s lack of food. Soon, he realized
    that it wasn’t just food that was missing. The apartment lacked the standard equipment—blank
    notebooks, quills, and sturdy furniture—found in every police building. Once he
    thought to look for it, Frank quickly located a large “For Rent” sign in the window.
    He was just lucky the police hadn’t rented it out or changed the combination yet.

  zh: 弗兰克整晚交替着回顾线索、在窗户旁警惕着Vinettee的暴徒，并哀叹安全屋缺乏食物。很快，他意识到，不仅仅是食物缺乏。公寓里缺少了每个警察局都有的标准设备——空白笔记本、羽毛笔和结实的家具。一旦他想到要找这些，弗兰克很快在窗户上发现了一个大大的“出租”标志。幸好警察还没有租出去或者更换密码。
- en: After a few hours, Frank convinced himself the Vinettees wouldn’t find him.
    He abandoned the windows, began to pace the empty apartment, and focused on the
    case. The When and Where were easy—the clues suggested an attack on the castle
    tomorrow night. Unfortunately, aside from the When and Where, Frank still didn’t
    have any answers. In particular, the Who, Why, How, and Could-I-Sneak-Out-for-Food-Without-the-Vinettees-Seeing-Me
    remained important open questions.

  zh: 几个小时后，弗兰克说服自己，Vinettees应该找不到他。他放弃了窗户，开始在空荡荡的公寓里踱步，集中精力思考案子。“何时”和“何地”很简单——线索表明明晚将会对城堡发动攻击。不幸的是，除了“何时”和“何地”，弗兰克依然没有答案。特别是“谁”、“为什么”、“怎么做”以及“我能偷偷出去找食物而不被Vinettees看到吗”这些问题，依旧是悬而未解的重要问题。
- en: After an hour of pacing while trying to fill in the remaining details, Frank
    had started to doubt even the When and Where. An attack on the castle seemed too
    obvious, and the police were already prepared for it. Even Socks was telling everyone
    he knew to watch for it.

- en: Frank stopped and swore as realization dawned. Socks had to be involved. With
    a familiar sense of *I knew I shouldn’t trust anyone*, Frank replayed the events
    of the last few days in his mind, this time recognizing the signs. He should have
    seen it when Socks’s staff “accidentally” ignited the papers in the cell and destroyed
    the evidence. He should have realized that someone had tipped off the spy about
    his visit to the cloak shop. He should have at least wondered about the absurd
    and conveniently timed rescue with the barrels of pickled eels. But above all
    else, he should have been absolutely certain from the moment Socks incorrectly
    inserted a node into the binary tree. No expert in binary trees would ever make
    that mistake by accident. It was true that he’d been suspicious the whole time,
    but then again, Frank suspected everyone all the time.

  zh: 弗兰克停下脚步，骂了声脏话，顿时意识到了事情的真相。Socks肯定参与其中。带着熟悉的*我早知道不该相信任何人*的感觉，弗兰克在脑海中回放了过去几天的事件，这次他认出了其中的迹象。他本该在Socks的手下“偶然”点燃牢房里的文件并销毁证据时就发现问题。他本该意识到，是有人泄露了他去斗篷店的消息给了间谍。他本该至少对那次荒谬且恰到好处的救援——用腌鳗鱼桶——产生疑问。但最重要的是，从Socks错误地插入二叉树节点的那一刻起，他就应该绝对确信。没有哪个二叉树专家会不小心犯这种错误。虽然他一直有些怀疑，但说到底，弗兰克总是怀疑每个人。
- en: The realization left him with even more questions. The Where and When were unanswered
    again. If Socks had been feeding them false information, Frank had to question
    everything. What were the wizards going to do, and how were they going to do it?
    Knowing the Why would also be nice, but Frank found that whenever he foiled elaborate
    plots, the perpetrators tended to babble on about the Why without provocation.
    By this point, he’d also given up on sneaking out for food, closing that question
    for now with a growling stomach.

  zh: 这一发现让他有了更多的疑问。“何时”和“何地”再次没有答案。如果Socks一直在给他们提供虚假的信息，弗兰克不得不重新审视一切。巫师们要做什么，他们又怎么做呢？知道“为什么”也不错，但弗兰克发现，每当他破坏了精心策划的阴谋时，作案者总是会在没有任何挑衅的情况下滔滔不绝地说出“为什么”。到此时为止，他也已经放弃了偷偷外出找食物的念头，暂时把这个问题搁置在了一个咕咕叫的肚子里。
- en: “How does the mask fit in?” Frank muttered to himself. If the thieves were planning
    to attack the castle, could they still use the mask? Or would Marcus’s ID badges
    render it useless? Did they just need it to break into the police station? And
    what records were the thieves after? Frank started enumerating the questions in
    his notebook. They quickly outnumbered the clues.

  zh: “面具是怎么回事？”Frank 自言自语。如果小偷们计划攻击这座城堡，他们还会用到面具吗？或者 Marcus 的身份证明是否会使其失效？他们是否只是需要它来闯入警察局？小偷们究竟想要什么记录？Frank
    开始在笔记本上列举这些问题。很快，问题的数量超过了线索。
- en: Frank thought about his next step. With such a limited timeline, he needed to
    push far into the realm of *heuristics*—rules of thumb that point algorithms in
    the right direction. For example, when searching for a lost turtle, Frank used
    the common “Check nearby first” heuristic, because turtles are slow. When seeking
    the freshest pot of coffee in the station, he relied on “Check the fullest cauldron”
    because it was often the most recently made. And when navigating to a tall castle
    in an unknown city, “Walk in the direction of the castle first” had usually gotten
    him there after only a few dead ends. Heuristics weren’t perfect, but they provided
    useful information.

  zh: Frank 思考着他的下一步。由于时间非常有限，他需要深入使用*启发式*方法——这些经验法则能帮助算法朝正确的方向推进。例如，当寻找丢失的乌龟时，Frank
    使用了常见的“先检查附近”这一启发式方法，因为乌龟行动缓慢。当他要在车站找到最新的咖啡时，他依赖“检查最满的锅”这一方法，因为那通常是最新冲泡的。而当他在一个陌生的城市寻找一座高塔时，“先朝塔的方向走”通常能让他在绕过几次死胡同后顺利找到目的地。启发式方法并不完美，但它们提供了有用的信息。

- en: It was a heuristic Frank had ignored only once in his career, when Glass Box
    Billy had provided multiple tips regarding an upcoming robbery. First, Billy had
    told Frank the getaway cart’s exact waiting location, model, and pitch of wheel
    squeak. Second, Billy had relayed a rumor, overheard between bouts of raucous
    cheering at a game of darts, that Rebecca Vinettee was personally involved and
    the target had something to do with fish.

  zh: 这是 Frank 唯一一次在职业生涯中忽略的启发式方法，当时 Glass Box Billy 提供了关于即将发生的抢劫案的多个线索。首先，Billy 告诉
    Frank 逃逸车的确切等待位置、型号和车轮的吱吱声频率。其次，Billy 传递了一则谣言，这是他在观看一场飞镖比赛时听到的，传闻中 Rebecca Vinettee
    亲自参与了此次抢劫，而目标与鱼有关。
- en: Frank had ignored every good police algorithm and decided to go after Rebecca
    Vinettee directly. He knew that she would disappear before they loaded the cart,
    probably using an alternate route back to the hideout. He had to catch her before
    she could vanish. He staked out the capital’s Fish Depot, which was only two blocks
    from the getaway cart’s location.

  zh: Frank 忽视了所有好的警察算法，决定直接追查 Rebecca Vinettee。他知道在他们装载逃逸车之前，她会消失，可能会用另一条路返回藏匿处。他必须在她消失之前抓住她。他在距离逃逸车位置仅两个街区的首都鱼类仓库附近守候。
- en: As the captain would later explain with excessively loud shouting, the Fish
    Depot happened to be two blocks in the wrong direction. On the other hand, the
    Orb Emporium was only a quarter of a block away from the getaway cart. A gang
    completely unaffiliated with the Vinettees stole 64 high-quality spherical glass
    orbs and 2 prototype cubic orbs, loaded them onto the getaway cart, and drove
    away with wheels squeaking precisely as annoyingly as Glass Box Billy had indicated.
    Frank’s description of Billy’s tip, and his insistence on adding a new heuristic
    of “always suspect the Vinettees,” did not convince the captain.

  zh: 正如队长后来会大声解释的那样，鱼类仓库恰好是在错误的方向走了两个街区。另一方面，Orb Emporium 离逃逸车的地点只有四分之一街区远。一个完全与
    Vinettee 家族无关的团伙偷走了64颗高质量的圆形玻璃球和2颗原型立方体玻璃球，将它们装上逃逸车，然后带着车轮发出和 Glass Box Billy
    描述的同样令人烦恼的吱吱声驶离。Frank 对 Billy 提供的线索的描述，以及他坚持增加一个新的启发式方法“总是怀疑 Vinettee 家族”的观点，并没有说服队长。
- en: 'In the current case, however, Frank was running out of even vague clues. He’d
    exhausted most of his concrete leads and was well into the realm of speculation
    and suspicion. If he wanted to make any more progress, he would need more information.
    He turned to his second most trusted heuristic: when at a dead end, collect more
    information. He needed to know more about the mask, how it could be used, and
    what magical defenses could thwart it. In this case, that meant finding an expert.'

    While you’ll undoubtedly hear some officers dismiss heuristics as random guesses,
    you’ll also see those same officers fall back on techniques and rules of thumb
    that have served them well in the past. It’s important to realize that heuristics,
    like all information, are of varying quality.

- en: 'One of the clearest examples of heuristics is navigating in the physical world.
    Whether you’re wandering through a maze, searching an unknown city, or simply
    finding your way to the mess hall, you’ll find yourself using heuristics to guide
    your search. Given two paths, which do you try first? A common and often reliable
    heuristic is to prioritize options according to simplified distance measures.
    My favorite is to use “as the bird flies” distance: How far away is the goal if
    there’s nothing in your way? In practice, this heuristic means I always take the
    path that looks like it is getting me closer to the goal—the path that at least
    starts out in the correct direction. I might run into a few dead ends this way,
    but overall I’ve found this to be a good heuristic.'

- en: Of course, there are plenty of terrible heuristics as well. Officers who use
    new heuristics without properly vetting them can find themselves in deep trouble.
    A few years ago, a young officer created a particularly bad heuristic. After unprecedented
    success busting a smuggling ring, he got it into his head that all investigations
    must start at the docks. The problem was that this heuristic is wrong. It didn’t
    help point his investigations in the right direction. In fact, it often led him
    immediately to a dead end. After 18 failed investigations, his captain assigned
    him to permanently patrolling the docks.

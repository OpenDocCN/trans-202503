    useful to be able to talk about electric charge that’s localized at a particular
    point in space, but it’s also useful to be able to talk about charge that’s distributed
    along a curve, along a surface, or throughout a volume. Such charge distributions
    are the subject of this short chapter.

    and volume charge density. We’ll then define a data type for charge distribution
    capable of representing a point charge, a line charge, a surface charge, a volume
    charge, or any combination of these. We’ll write functions to find the total charge
    and the electric dipole moment of a charge distribution. Electric charge gives
    rise to electric fields. Having a good language for charge distributions prepares
    us for the next chapter, in which we’ll find the electric field produced by a

    effects, and it plays a key role in electromagnetic theory. In classical electromagnetic
    theory, which we’re studying in this book, we’ll sometimes think of charge as

    imagining that it has a location in space but no spatial extent.

    continuously distributed throughout a region of space). In fact, we use three
    types of continuous charge distributions. First, there is charge continuously
    distributed along a one-dimensional path such as a line or a curve. In this case,
    we speak of the *linear charge density λ*, meaning the charge per unit length.
    This use of the Greek letter lambda is separate and independent of its use in
    [Chapter 20](ch20.xhtml) to mean wavelength. The SI unit for linear charge density
    is the Coulomb per meter (C/m).

    volume. In this case, we speak of the *volume charge density ρ* (Greek letter
    rho), meaning the charge per unit volume. The SI unit for volume charge density
    is the Coulomb per cubic meter (C/m³). [Table 24-1](ch24.xhtml#ch24tab1) summarizes
    these charge distributions.

    can be realized only on insulators, on which the charges cannot move. So I can
    charge the tail of my cat to 10 times the charge density as his nose because the
    electrons stay put. Macroscopic *conductors* cannot support arbitrary charge densities:
    the charges move, redistributing themselves very rapidly. So you should imagine

    good in that human readers of the code (including the writer of the code) will
    know the intent of an expression with type `Charge`. It is, in this sense, a form
    of documentation for the code. However, it is silly because the compiler doesn’t
    make any distinction between `Charge` and `R` and `Double`, so it cannot help
    the writer to avoid using `Charge` in any place an `R` or a `Double` could be
    used. One of the main purposes of types is separating things that should be separated
    and letting the computer help enforce that separation. Charge is not at all the

    charge, we need to specify how much charge there is and where the charge is located,

    specify a curve along which the charge sits and the linear charge density at each
    point on the curve. The linear charge density need not be uniform along the curve.
    It could be high in some places and low in others, or even positive in some places
    and negative in others. We will use a scalar field to specify the linear charge

    distribution. A curious attribute of this data type is that it is recursive. The
    information required by the `MultipleCharges` constructor is a list of `ChargeDistribution`s,
    the very type we are defining. We can think that there are four basic sorts of
    charge distribution (point, line, surface, and volume) and one composite sort

    Write a charge distribution for this hydrogen atom. Since our volumes are finite,
    use a spherical ball with a radius of 10[*a*0] for the volume that holds the charge
    density. This will omit a tiny bit of the electron’s negative charge. See how
    close to neutral your hydrogen atom is by using `totalCharge` on the charge distribution
    you write.

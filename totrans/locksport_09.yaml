- en: One of the challenges for locksport hobbyists is finding good sources for equipment.
    Some sellers will deal only with bona fide locksmiths, while others are happy
    to sell you gear, only for you to find out that it’s poorly made and not worth
    your money. To that end, we’re providing this appendix of trustworthy vendors
    and merchants that sell lockpicking hardware.
  prefs: []

- en: It’s worth noting that shops sometimes come and go, and others might ship only
    to a limited number of countries. Additionally, lockpickers each tend to have
    their own preferences, so what works for one person might not be great for another.
    Finally, not every tool from every vendor is great. Please don’t view this list
    as an endorsement, but rather as a guide if you’re having trouble finding the
    tools you need for locksport.

    you want to order.

    Look for safe lock sales in October, when most retailers celebrate “Locktoberfest.”
    Often bulk buys are an affordable option. MBA also sells lock mounts (search *lock
    stand*). Be willing to pay a little extra for the models with the threaded inserts;
    they will survive many a lock swap-out and tightening.

    UK marketplace sites with vendors that might ship globally, such as [eBay.uk](http://eBay.uk),
    [Amazon.co.uk](http://Amazon.co.uk), and Alibaba or AliExpress.
  prefs: []

    tools*. However, their quality and utility is rather unpredictable, so you’re
    often better off making your own tools to fit your specific lock.
  prefs: []

- en: Some lever locks are commonly sold outside the UK, such as safe deposit box
    locks and keyed safe locks. However, neither option is great for beginners. Safe
    deposit box locks tend to be small and use smaller-than-average keyways and levers.
    This can make learning on them difficult.
  prefs: []

    to be high-security locks, making them a challenge for even experienced lever

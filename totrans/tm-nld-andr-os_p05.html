<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">Y</span>ou read a lot of pages<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#p05-footnote-1" id="p05-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup> to get here. Congratulations! Here I pull it all together to answer the question: How did Android succeed? Given all the factors that could have led to its failure, and did just that for so many other companies and platforms trying to compete in the smartphone space in that same time period, why Android? As with any successful project, there were many contributing factors, but it all started with the team.</p>

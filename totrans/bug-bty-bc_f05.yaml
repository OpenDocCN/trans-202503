    already located a few low-impact bugs in the application I was testing, including
    a CSRF, an IDOR, and a few information leaks. Eventually, I managed to chain these
    into a full takeover of any account on the website: I could have logged in as
    anyone, read anyone’s data, and altered it however I wanted. For an instant, I
    felt like I had superpowers.'

    Hackers are probably the closest thing to superheroes I’ve encountered in the
    real world. They overcome limitations with their skills to make software programs
    do much more than they were designed for, which is what I love about hacking web
    applications: it’s all about thinking creatively, challenging yourself, and doing
    more than what seems possible.'

    data breaches happen every year in the United States alone. By understanding vulnerabilities
    and how they happen, you can use your knowledge for good to help prevent malicious
    attacks, protect applications and users, and make the internet a safer place.

    But now, thanks to bug bounty programs, you can hack legally; companies set up
    bug bounty programs to reward security researchers for finding vulnerabilities
    in their applications. *Bug Bounty Bootcamp* teaches you how to hack web applications
    and how to do it legally by participating in these programs. You’ll learn how
    to navigate bug bounty programs, perform reconnaissance on a target, and identify
    and exploit vulnerabilities.

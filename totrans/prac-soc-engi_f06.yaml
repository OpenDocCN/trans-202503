    delivering malware or other payloads, but sometimes it is the endgame, such as
    in attacks designed to trick victims into handing over their banking information.
    The beautiful disaster that comes from social engineering is that, aside from
    phishing, it is *really* hard to detect. Whether you’re just breaking into the
    information security industry, a seasoned penetration tester, or on the defensive
    side, you will likely be exposed to social engineering sooner rather than later.

    understanding, help you build better processes and detections, and enable you
    to identify the singular flaw in the logic of a process to succeed in your exploitation.
    The how will change over time, but the why is rooted in hundreds, if not thousands,
    of years of human DNA.

    and the psychological concepts at the root of the discipline. We also dedicate
    a chapter to social engineering’s ethical considerations. Unlike traditional penetration
    testing, which handles data and systems, social engineering penetration tests
    target people and thus require exceptional care.

- en: This is a discussion of how to perform social engineering. We begin with OSINT,
    its usefulness in social engineering attacks, and how to collect it using a number
    of professional tools. We then walk through a sophisticated phishing attack designed
    to steal users’ credentials, drawing attention to the many tricks used to fool
    users and defenders alike. We also cover how to measure the impact of your engagement
    and communicate its severity to your client.

    to proactively protect your team from social engineering attacks, as well as strategies
    for quickly recovering when attacks do succeed. We also explore technical email
    controls and tools for analyzing potentially suspicious emails.

    aspirations) than the others, but I encourage you to read the entire book to better
    grasp what to expect from the opposing side of the engagement as well.

    for learning about social engineering. After you’ve read this book, it can serve
    as an amplifying reference or complement to other material. You should continue
    to study psychology, sociology, and human-computer interaction, in addition to
    what malicious actors are using as their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs),
    to remain current in social engineering. This field and the associated research
    are constantly evolving.'

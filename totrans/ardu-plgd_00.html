<div class="image1"><img alt="image" src="../images/common-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Welcome to <em>Arduino Playground</em>! This book provides a broad spectrum of projects demonstrating the flexibility and versatility of the Arduino family of microcontroller boards. Each project contains everything you need to know to build it, including a schematic, a component list, and any <em>sketches</em> (that’s what Arduino folks call programs). I also endeavored to provide all information about the mechanical parts of each project, including a list of supplies, so you can complete any enclosures, moving parts, skeletons, and so on. Any special tools required are also described in the projects.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">I have tried to make the projects more than just recipes for assembling the parts by including some background explanations of how I came up with the projects and how the technology works. I hope that the projects can be useful end products by themselves and, with some ingenuity, perhaps even serve as a launching pad for you to create projects of your own.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="introlev1sec1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xx"/><strong>Who This Book Is For</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindentb">Building the projects in this book does not require an engineering degree, advanced mechanical aptitude, or programming expertise. That said, there are some basic requirements you should have to get the most out of the book:</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• An understanding of basic electronics, including the ability to read a schematic diagram and recognize elements such as resistors and capacitors</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• An understanding of how to use computers and write software (Von Neumann architecture if you want to be snobby); knowledge of Arduino or other microcontroller architectures helps</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• Experience soldering connections and wires</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• Limited mechanical skills, such as how to operate an electric drill, various saws, and so on</p>&#13;
<p class="indentt">My hope is that both beginner and experienced Arduino users will learn something new about electronics in these projects.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="introlev1sec2"><strong>How This Book Is Organized</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Each chapter focuses on one project and describes how to prototype it on a breadboard for testing, briefly discusses how the sketch works, and finally shows how to construct the final product.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• <strong><a href="ch00.xhtml#ch00">Chapter 0</a>: Setting Up and Useful Skills</strong> provides you with some basic knowledge that you’ll use throughout the book, including how to prepare Arduino boards, how to program them, and how to use PCB software and make your own PCBs.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• In <strong><a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1</a>: The Reaction-Time Machine</strong>, you take advantage of the real-time capabilities of the Arduino microcontroller by measuring a user’s reaction to a stimulus. This project is quick and easy to build, and you’ll learn some of the fundamentals of using a controller for timing—with lots of opportunity to experiment with the sketch. The finished unit will provide hours of fun and entertainment for you and your friends and family.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• <strong><a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>: An Automated Agitator for PCB Etching</strong> shows how you can use a change in current drain to make things happen in a circuit. In this case, the change reverses the direction of a motor so that it can be used to agitate printed-circuit boards in an etchant solution. Etching PCBs is but one application for the technology, as explained in the chapter.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• The project in <strong><a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3</a>: The Regulated Power Supply</strong> may well turn out to be one of the most frequently used products on your workbench. It’s a regulated variable-voltage power supply with a digital readout for voltage and current. The design is simple yet effective, and it’s fun to build.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxi"/>• The project in <strong><a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4</a>: A Watch Winder</strong> is one of my favorites. It serves the utilitarian function of keeping automatic (self-winding) watches wound when not being worn, but the cool design also makes it a great kinetic sculpture. The Watch Winder uses an Arduino Nano to handle all the timing functions for keeping the watches wound and includes a multi-colored LED light display. Some of the assembly techniques may challenge a beginner, but the effort is more than worth it.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• The project in <strong><a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">Chapter 5</a>: The Garage Sentry Parking Assistant</strong> is a high-tech device designed to help you park your vehicle in your garage. It’s the electronic version of a tennis-ball-on-a-string contraption that’s designed to measure the distance you want to pull into your garage. It introduces ultrasonic transmitters and receivers and illustrates how they can be integrated with the Arduino controller. While this is a very practical application of the technology, other applications (such as liquid measurement) are limited only by your imagination.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• In <strong><a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06">Chapter 6</a>: The Battery Saver</strong>, you make a device to help keep lead-acid storage batteries from being ruined by accidental discharge. The design is basically a high-current switch in series with a battery that disconnects when the battery reaches a dangerous level. While most automobiles today incorporate such circuitry, I have found this project particularly useful on boats and utility vehicles (tractors, mowers, and so on), and it can save you from having to replace these expensive batteries needlessly.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• In <strong><a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07">Chapter 7</a>: A Custom pH Meter</strong>, you build a precision instrument for measuring pH in a variety of liquids. While the Custom pH Meter uses a professional probe, the electronics and readout are based on the Arduino processor. If you’re into home brewing, winemaking, hydroponics, or aquariums, or if you’re just managing the chemistry in your pool, the Custom pH Meter will be a welcome tool.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• The project in <strong><a href="ch08.xhtml#ch08">Chapter 8</a>: Two Ballistic Chronographs</strong> is designed to measure the muzzle velocity of various guns from Airsoft pistols and rifles to BB guns and pellet guns. While not intended for conventional firearms, it boasts capability of measuring velocities over 2,500 feet per second. It also introduces some new technology to the stage, including some stand-alone logic, a counter, and a DAC. Two versions of the chronograph are described; the smaller one, Chronograph Lite, measures projectiles with velocities up to about 700 feet per second.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• In <strong><a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09">Chapter 9</a>: The Square-Wave Generator</strong>, you build a low cost instrument for generating electronic waveforms. The genesis of the project was to provide a simulator for the Ballistic Chronograph in <a href="ch08.xhtml#ch08">Chapter 8</a>, but it worked so well that I made a separate project of it. While it falls short of the resolution and flexibility of regular laboratory instruments, you’ll find it useful in designing and testing various products—and at a fraction of the price.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxii"/>• In <strong><a href="ch10.xhtml#ch10">Chapter 10</a>: The Chromatic Thermometer</strong>, you create a handy gadget that tells the temperature using a sequence of colored LEDs. While the initial design is simple, the project led to variations that are more complex. You can add a digital readout, a high-accuracy sensor, and a variety of mechanical variants for everything from monitoring a fish tank to a wall decoration.</p>&#13;
<p class="indentt">This book does not cover the basic engineering or programming concepts behind every project in depth, as it assumes you have enough background knowledge to understand those concepts based on a brief explanation. But for the curious reader, the text does provide references where extra information can be found about the design and technology. It also gives background into the history of the project: why I built the project (and why you might want to build it). In all cases, there has been an effort to provide a learning experience at a level the user can appreciate and understand.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Where possible, the projects also suggest alternative approaches that advanced readers can try. To demonstrate why I selected a particular approach, I illustrate how some alternative ways of doing things solve certain problems and cause others. There’s a lot of room to personalize, and perhaps even improve on, each project, whether it be packaging, construction technique, or the sketch itself. For example, the Watch Winder can be a utilitarian device or an upscale kinetic sculpture.</p>&#13;
<div class="box1">&#13;
<p class="boxtitle"><strong>WHAT IS MECHATRONICS?</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">During the course of writing this book, I ran across the term <em>mechatronics</em> several times. Being kind of a traditionalist (or just an old fuddy-duddy), I ignored the first several references. However, I eventually took the time to look up the term, and it sure sounds a lot like what we’re doing in this book.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Put simply, mechatronics is the process of designing with electronics and mechanical engineering. Tetsuro Mori, the senior engineer of the Japanese company Yaskawa in 1969, coined the term to describe the process of building industrial robots, which requires electrical, mechanical, and computer engineering. A mechatronics engineer unites the principles of mechanics, electronics, and computing to generate a simpler, more economical, and more reliable system.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="introlev1sec3"><strong>About the Parts Lists</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In the design phase of this book, the selection of parts for projects was often determined by what I might have had lying around the shop. For example, the bearings in the Watch Winder from <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4</a> were originally bearings I had in my junk bin, but I eventually replaced them with the ones <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxiii"/>mentioned in the parts list. I have made every effort to make the projects with the tools and materials as described, but I encourage you to use what you have handy.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="bgblack">NOTE</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>Almost everyone I know who has programmed an Arduino started with the simple “blink” sketch. As a result, many see Arduino as inextricably entwined with LEDs turning on and off. Throughout the book, I attempt to reinforce this association by including LEDs in as many projects as possible. While blinking an LED doesn’t even scratch the surface of the Arduino’s capabilities, LEDs make the projects more fun and visually interactive</em>.</p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="introlev1sec4"><strong>Tools and Supplies</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Before you begin working through this book, review the following lists of tools and supplies, and note any items you don’t have. Not all of these are required for every project, so when you want to build a project, read the required tools and supplies lists for that particular chapter to see if you are missing anything essential. You can purchase most of these items at your local hardware store, but I will indicate where buying online might be a better option.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="introlev2sec1"><em><strong>Drilling, Cutting, and Assembling</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Screwdrivers</strong> You’ll want both Philips and slotted, in multiple sizes.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Dremel tool (or equivalent)</strong> A small drill or rotary tool can be very useful for a variety of tasks, from drilling and cutting to etching and polishing. An inexpensive bench attachment turns the Dremel tool into a small drill press, which is really handy, especially for drilling PCBs.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Electric drill</strong> Battery operated is preferable. If possible, I suggest a chuck with 3/8-inch or 1/2-inch capacity—the bigger the better.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Drill bit set</strong> I recommend purchasing a numbered drill set (that is, with bits labeled #1 through #60) in addition to a fractional drill set.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Pliers</strong> I find that a pair of vise-grip pliers, about 6 to 8 inches long, fills many needs for clamping, holding things in place, and tightening. I also recommend getting a good pair of needle-nose pliers.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Saws</strong> A simple hacksaw is handy for a variety of tasks. For cutting plastic, there are many options: a keyhole saw works well, or if you don’t mind spending some more money, a small variable-speed, hand-held jigsaw (or saber saw) is handy for making a variety of cuts. I use my jigsaw almost exclusively with hacksaw blades. (Practice sawing on some scrap wood if you’ve never used a jigsaw before. Once you understand how to use it, a jigsaw can be one of the handiest tools in the shop.)</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Sharp knife and scissors</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Screws and nuts</strong> I suggest trying to get a small assortment of both English and metric screws and nuts. There are many such assortments on eBay, if your local hardware store doesn’t have a good selection.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxiv"/><strong>Tap and die set</strong> A set isn’t required for most projects, as individual taps and dies are available, but a set is cheap and handy to have around.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Tapered reamer</strong> A tapered reamer is useful in many of the book’s projects, and it’s a tool I heartily recommend having. I use a set of two inexpensive reamers that I purchased on Amazon, and they work very well on plastic, aluminum, and mild steel. I suggest getting reamers that can create holes up to 7/8 inches in diameter.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Tape</strong> I suggest keeping masking tape, double-sided foam tape, and rugged outdoor double-sided tape (3M brand works well) on hand.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="introlev2sec2"><em><strong>Prototyping, Soldering, and Testing</strong></em></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Alligator clips or clip-lead set</strong> There are many alligator clips available, and they are very handy when putting together breadboards. Sets are available from multiple sources, including RadioShack and Amazon.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Breadboard and jumper wires</strong> These are available from multiple sources, including Pololu and Amazon.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Digital multimeter</strong> A broad spectrum of multimeter units is available. You can pay anywhere from under $5 to hundreds of dollars, but low-priced portable units work fine. You will find a multimeter a welcome addition to your household tool collection.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Resistor assortment</strong> I suggest checking eBay or Amazon, where you can buy resistors in bulk easily. Some assortments might include 10 units each of 20 or 30 values, while others contain 100 or more resistors per value. These are very economically priced.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Soldering iron and solder</strong> Soldering irons are readily available at hardware stores, often for less than $10. Jameco even has an online soldering tutorial (<em><a href="http://www.jameco.com/Jameco/workshop/learning-center/soldering-basics.html">http://www.jameco.com/Jameco/workshop/learning-center/soldering-basics.html</a></em>) that might be worth reading if you’re a beginner.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Solder paste</strong> This is needed only if you have trouble soldering surface-mount components. While these projects use only a small handful of surface-mount components, you may use more in the future as manufacturers make fewer through-hole versions of newer integrated circuits. I use a lead-free solder paste called Chip Quik. Don’t despair, though: you can solder surface-mount components with regular rosin-core solder and a soldering iron as described in “<a href="ch00.xhtml#ch00lev1sec7">Using SOICs</a>” on <a href="ch00.xhtml#page_20">page 20</a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent1"><strong>Solder wick</strong> While none of us would ever be careless enough to make a solder bridge across connections, sometimes a gremlin sneaks in and does it anyway. For those occasions, solder wick (a copper braid with a little rosin on it to soaks up solder) lets you remove solder cleanly.</p>&#13;
<p class="indentt">If you like building complete Arduino projects, consider filling out your tool collection with any missing items. Everything described here will surely be useful at some point.</p>&#13;

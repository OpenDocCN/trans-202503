    chair. He could hear soft footsteps behind him as whoever held the crossbow moved
    forward.

    not the sort to rely on private investigators. As I recall, he takes particular
    pleasure in developing novel threats to keep busybodies away from active cases.”

    black-and-white view of the world made them particularly effective as security
    guards. You couldn’t talk yourself out of trouble with a Boolean. Either you were
    breaking the rules, or you weren’t.

    taking a full minute to place the letter on the desk. He didn’t sit back. The
    less he moved, the better.

    the crossbow’s safety snap on. He exhaled in relief and leaned back in the chair.
    Dr. Loop waved the guard out of the room.

    his face, as though analyzing every reaction. All traces of pleasantry were gone;
    her voice was all business. Frank wondered how much of her pleasant chit-chat
    had been an act. Wizard Criminology was a dangerous field, and Dr. Loop had survived
    a long time.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Basic alerting spells,” said Dr. Loop. “They will tell you if someone uses
    magic in the station, but they won’t prevent it.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Why not a magical barrier?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Not practical,” explained the professor. “The police force uses too many wizard
    consultants. They need to be able to cast divining spells on the evidence, truth
    spells for the prisoners, magical mirroring spells for the records, and reheating
    spells for lunch.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “It would be too expensive anyway,” added Dr. Loop. “Only the royal castle and
    prison have more than the basic alerting spells. The castle has a bunch of protection
    spells, but no dampening spells. Marcus does too much work there for the king.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: “They could,” replied Dr. Loop, “but it wouldn’t be wise. The castle has a dozen
    protective spells that will block offensive magic. King Fredrick also employs
    a half-dozen wizard guards. They’re junior, but they can undo a basic curse. And
    then there is Marcus. Few wizards would want to cross him.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “What about artifacts?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Ah. Now that’s a good question. It depends on the artifact. The castle has
    protection against weaponized artifacts, of course, but nothing can protect against
    all artifacts. There are simply too many varieties. Since most artifacts don’t
    require new magic (having been previously enchanted), not even the spell-blocking
    spells in the prison could help there.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “What?” asked Frank. “I thought the prison was immune to all magic. Don’t they
    keep evil wizards there? In fact, isn’t Exponentious there? He tried to destroy
    the entire kingdom with magic. Why don’t they just block all magical artifacts
    from working?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Dr. Loop gave a dry laugh. “Sorry to disappoint you, but you can’t block all
    the artifacts. Don’t worry, though; the royal wizards keep the most powerful ones
    well guarded. And all prisoners are thoroughly searched when they arrive.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “What other protection does the prison have?” asked Frank, panic building as
    the pieces started to fall into place.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Let’s see,” said Dr. Loop. She began to tick off the list on her fingers. “Stone
    walls, a moat filled with cranky badgers, a hundred guards, heavy oak doors, a
    few ornamental pine doors, the Spell of Mild Nausea in each hallway, the Spell
    of Difficult Searching, the—”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Spell of Difficult Searching?” interrupted Frank.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “It isn’t new,” Dr. Loop explained. “They cast a load of protective spells on
    the prison before they cast the Spell of Spell Blocking.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “What does the Spell of Difficult Searching do?” asked Frank, a feeling of dread
    rising in his chest.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Makes it hard to find a prisoner’s cell. More accurately, it magically swaps
    cells. If you picture the cells as a giant array, the Spell of Difficult Searching
    would be an algorithm that swaps array indexes. It does a random swap of everything
    at midnight each night.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “It makes it hard for anyone to break out their friends. Without structure in
    the array values, intruders have to rely on exhaustive search. And, since the
    cells are shuffled daily, you can’t break up the search over several nights. The
    guards complain that the randomness is just annoying. They spend hours each day
    taking roll call. Although I heard that they’ve recently made a game around it
    called ‘Who’s Behind the Next Door?’ Bets can get up to a silver piece per door.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Do they write down the new cell locations?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “That would defeat the entire purpose! If they kept a mapping of prisoners to
    cells, like an inverted index, then you could just look up the prisoner. What
    good would the spell be if you could break into the capital police station’s record
    room and steal the cell assignments? The goal is to make intruders spend hours
    searching through the prison, which would clearly be impossible. All the guards
    know each other.”

- en: Frank saw the final piece fall into place. The captain had said that the League
    of Unnecessary Complexity were followers or accomplices of that evil wizard Exponentious—the
    most dangerous criminal in the royal prison. Everyone was worried that the league
    was planning to strike again, maybe even to attack the castle. But the plan was
    so much simpler than that. The league was planning a prison break; they were going
    to free their leader. He leapt from his chair, grateful the crossbow-wielding
    Boolean was no longer behind him, and sprinted for the door.

    in his side. He managed to gasp out little more than “need your help . . . prison
    break . . . tonight . . . wizards.”

    mild annoyance. “Spit it out, Frank,” she finally said.

    at frightening speed, connecting the remaining dots. Suddenly her expression darkened
    and she looked back at Frank. “Why are you telling me this?” she asked. “I’m off
    the case, remember?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    you?” he asked. “Don’t you want to capture the thieves?”
  prefs: []

    so or not. Isn’t it?”
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    force on this one. At least not yet. I’m pretty sure one of the crooks is impersonating
    a police officer, but I don’t know which one. Until I figure that out, I can’t
    trust anyone.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “That’s not a good reason,” said Notation, clearly offended by the implication.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Not like that,” said Frank, waving off her objections. “I mean because you’re
    at this shop, buying an overpriced heap with your own funds. You obviously care
    about your job. More importantly, if you were in any way involved with a wizard’s
    prison break, you would simply have the league of evil wizards make you a magic
    heap. No one in their right mind would walk all the way to the Orb district if
    they had better options.”

    “really angry” and approached “you’ve made a horrible mistake.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “You *told* me to come here,” she said through gritted teeth.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Good thing, too,” said Frank. “I knew exactly where to find you. It was the
    world’s easiest search problem—like finding a value in an array when you know
    the index. I just came straight to Heaperous’s shop. I did have to run, though,”
    he conceded. “I figured you’d be here early, and I didn’t want to miss you.”
  prefs: []

    the plot?”
  prefs: []

    occurred to me as I was running here. I thought—”

    a separate accusation.

  prefs: []

    of red and apparently unable to complete the insult.

- en: If you learned only one thing from this class, it should be that *the key to
    efficient algorithms is information*. When approaching a new problem, take the
    time to understand the structure of the problem and its data. The more structure
    the problem has, the more potential you have to utilize this information. As you’ve
    seen, finding a value in a sorted array is significantly easier than in a completely
    random array. Sometime you can even build auxiliary data structures, such as heaps
    or inverted indexes, to provide the structure you need. Regardless, your first
    step should always be to understand the problem.

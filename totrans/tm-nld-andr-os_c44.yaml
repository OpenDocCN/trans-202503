    has gone through many names and types of collaboration over the years. At the
    time of Nexus One, the collaboration with HTC was given the brand “With Google.”
    The slogan was invented in engineering. Marketing had come up with the slogan,
    “It’s got Google.” But Rebecca, on the systems team, complained to Andy Rubin:
    “It’s not even grammatical! What about ‘With Google’ instead?” Andy said “Okay!”
    The co-branding slogan was born.'

  zh: Passion是“Google Experience”系列手机之一。Google Experience的过程经过多年变化，曾有过许多不同的名称和合作形式。在Nexus
    One发布时，与HTC的合作被赋予了“With Google”这一品牌。这个口号是在工程团队中诞生的。市场部原本提出的口号是“它有Google”。但系统团队的Rebecca向Andy
    Rubin抱怨：“这句话都不合语法！那‘With Google’怎么样？”Andy说：“好的！”于是，这一联合品牌口号诞生了。
- en: Passion had a large (for that time) screen and hand-fitting curves. But the
    unique thing about Passion wasn’t the hardware or software; it was the sales model
    that Android attempted. In the US, the way that everyone bought their phone back
    then (and now, for the most part) was through a contract with their carrier. Rather
    than buying a device on its own and then paying a carrier to be on their network,
    you went to a T-Mobile store (for example) and bought one of the phones they offered.
    Phones were sold at a substantial discount, along with a contractual lock-in for
    some period of time. That’s just how the phone market worked.

  zh: Passion拥有当时较大的屏幕和适合手持的曲线。但Passion的独特之处并非硬件或软件，而是Android所尝试的销售模式。在美国，大家当时（现在大部分时间也是）购买手机的方式是通过与运营商签订合同。与其单独购买设备，再支付运营商费用接入其网络，人们会去T-Mobile商店（例如）购买他们提供的手机。手机以大幅折扣出售，并附带一定期限的合同锁定。这就是手机市场的运作方式。
- en: But Android leadership had this idea that people should have options. What if
    they chose their phone independent of the carrier, paying a carrier just to be
    connected to their network? They would be free of contractual obligations, and
    users would have more choice because people wouldn’t have to pick from just those
    devices that happened to be on the carrier store’s shelves.

  zh: 但Android的领导层有一个想法，那就是人们应该有选择权。假如他们独立选择手机，而不是通过运营商选择手机，且只支付运营商费用以连接到他们的网络呢？这样他们就不受合同约束，用户的选择也更多了，因为他们不必从运营商店铺里那些偶然摆放的设备中挑选。
- en: Google didn’t have store fronts, so they offered the Nexus One for sale online.
    And they waited. But it turns out that people didn’t really understand this model
    of buying phones and weren’t in a rush to figure it out. Moreover, if there were
    problems with a phone they bought off the website, there wasn’t a customer service
    number to call, and there also wasn’t a store that they could return it to or
    get help from.

- en: The Nexus One was the first of many phones in the Nexus series. Nexus phones
    were devices that the Android team would work on in conjunction with manufacturers
    to create an overall Android phone experience. The team couldn’t control what
    other manufacturers would produce and sell, either in the hardware or the software
    and apps that might be layered on top of Android. By shipping their own phones,
    Android could ensure that those devices had exactly the hardware they wanted (within
    the range of what hardware partners could offer, at least) and exactly the software
    they wanted.

  zh: Nexus One是Nexus系列中第一款手机。Nexus手机是Android团队与制造商合作开发的设备，目的是创造一个整体的Android手机体验。团队无法控制其他制造商在硬件、软件以及可能在Android上层叠加的应用程序的生产与销售。通过推出自己的手机，Android可以确保这些设备拥有他们想要的硬件（至少在硬件合作伙伴可以提供的范围内），并且拥有他们想要的软件。
- en: The other, and perhaps main, reason for the Nexus program was to produce a “reference
    device.” Nexus phones showed the world (and partners) what Android was capable
    of in that release. But the team also ensured that the platform reliably supported
    new capabilities, which might have been harder if the hardware were being developed
    separately from the software. For many years and releases, a new Nexus phone launched
    in conjunction with each software release, showing off the latest hardware advancements
    along with new capabilities of Android.

  zh: Nexus项目的另一个，或许是主要的，原因是生产一款“参考设备”。Nexus手机向世界（以及合作伙伴）展示了该版本的Android所能实现的功能。但团队也确保平台可靠地支持新功能，这在硬件与软件分开开发的情况下可能会更难实现。在许多年和多个版本中，新的Nexus手机会与每次软件发布同时推出，展示最新的硬件进展以及Android的新功能。
- en: Throughout Android’s history, one of the most important dynamics about Nexus,
    and other devices that Google helped launch, was that they were made by different
    manufacturers. This was very intentional, as a way to get the entire partner community
    invested in Android. Early devices from Google included phones by HTC, Motorola,
    LG, and Samsung.

- en: Charles Mendis said, “A lot of credit to Andy and biz dev. We didn’t just partner
    with one; we’d switch between them. We managed to get some of the biggest players
    in the hardware space invested in Android, where it became *their* platform, and
    now all this phone hardware is done by them. We made them feel like everybody
    else owned Android, too; Android wasn’t owned by Google.^([3](#c44-footnote-3))

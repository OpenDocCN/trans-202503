    variety of devices. Not only are there many different models of phones made by
    many different manufacturers, but there are also tablets. And cameras. And TVs.
    And autos. And watches. And IoT devices. And entertainment screens on airplanes.^([1](#c44-footnote-1))

    that were under discussion in June 2006 were Sooner (HTC wedge), Later (LG wedge),
    Dream (HTC G1), and Grail (a Motorola device that would slide one way for qwerty
    and the other way for keypad). Grail (or some variant of it) would keep popping
    up and going away over the years.” But the plan eventually settled into just Sooner
    and Dream, whose respective demise and development is discussed in earlier chapters.

    Magic. It came out in the Spring of 2009 with the Android 1.5 Cupcake release.
    The actual hardware specs were similar to those in the original G1, although the
    Magic had more memory. But the biggest change was the keyboard: Android was finally
    comfortable with going fully touchscreen and dropped the hardware keyboard that
    was on the earlier G1 device. The Magic also supported multi-touch^([2](#c44-footnote-2))
    for the first time on Android.'

    has gone through many names and types of collaboration over the years. At the
    time of Nexus One, the collaboration with HTC was given the brand “With Google.”
    The slogan was invented in engineering. Marketing had come up with the slogan,
    “It’s got Google.” But Rebecca, on the systems team, complained to Andy Rubin:
    “It’s not even grammatical! What about ‘With Google’ instead?” Andy said “Okay!”
    The co-branding slogan was born.'

- en: Passion had a large (for that time) screen and hand-fitting curves. But the
    unique thing about Passion wasn’t the hardware or software; it was the sales model
    that Android attempted. In the US, the way that everyone bought their phone back
    then (and now, for the most part) was through a contract with their carrier. Rather
    than buying a device on its own and then paying a carrier to be on their network,
    you went to a T-Mobile store (for example) and bought one of the phones they offered.
    Phones were sold at a substantial discount, along with a contractual lock-in for
    some period of time. That’s just how the phone market worked.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But Android leadership had this idea that people should have options. What if
    they chose their phone independent of the carrier, paying a carrier just to be
    connected to their network? They would be free of contractual obligations, and
    users would have more choice because people wouldn’t have to pick from just those
    devices that happened to be on the carrier store’s shelves.

    And they waited. But it turns out that people didn’t really understand this model
    of buying phones and weren’t in a rush to figure it out. Moreover, if there were
    problems with a phone they bought off the website, there wasn’t a customer service
    number to call, and there also wasn’t a store that they could return it to or
    get help from.

    It never sold as much as Google had hoped and was far outsold by the Motorola

- en: The Nexus One was the first of many phones in the Nexus series. Nexus phones
    were devices that the Android team would work on in conjunction with manufacturers
    to create an overall Android phone experience. The team couldn’t control what
    other manufacturers would produce and sell, either in the hardware or the software
    and apps that might be layered on top of Android. By shipping their own phones,
    Android could ensure that those devices had exactly the hardware they wanted (within
    the range of what hardware partners could offer, at least) and exactly the software
    they wanted.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other, and perhaps main, reason for the Nexus program was to produce a “reference
    device.” Nexus phones showed the world (and partners) what Android was capable
    of in that release. But the team also ensured that the platform reliably supported
    new capabilities, which might have been harder if the hardware were being developed
    separately from the software. For many years and releases, a new Nexus phone launched
    in conjunction with each software release, showing off the latest hardware advancements
    along with new capabilities of Android.

- en: Throughout Android’s history, one of the most important dynamics about Nexus,
    and other devices that Google helped launch, was that they were made by different
    manufacturers. This was very intentional, as a way to get the entire partner community
    invested in Android. Early devices from Google included phones by HTC, Motorola,
    LG, and Samsung.

    with one; we’d switch between them. We managed to get some of the biggest players
    in the hardware space invested in Android, where it became *their* platform, and
    now all this phone hardware is done by them. We made them feel like everybody
    else owned Android, too; Android wasn’t owned by Google.^([3](#c44-footnote-3))
    I think that really helped the success of it.”

    how telephones worked, so his teacher created a class activity and brought in
    her own telephone from home. “I took it apart all the way down to the wax-enclosed
    transformers. There was no hope of me putting this back together. It was waxy.
    It made a big mess in the cafeteria. I had never actually done this before. I
    got in a lot of trouble because she expected to be able to take her telephone
    home and use it that night, and that was not going to happen.”

    many of the people on the team, including Andy’s admin, Tracey Cole. Brian’s advice:

    can possibly gain the trust of in life.”'

    said “Not Bjones.” Just to make things clear.

<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">T</span>oward the end of 2004, the small Android startup needed reinforcements. Andy and Chris provided enough engineering and design wherewithal to get some of the initial vision and technology working. But when they started pitching actual products to investors, they needed an engineering team to help create the platform and technology demos while the founders worked on the business. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Brian Swetland, who had worked with Andy at Danger, was looking for a new challenge.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c03-0001">Brian Swetland, Android’s First Engineer</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">From the age of five, Brian Swetland (referred to simply as “Swetland” on the team) had been a systems programmer.</p>
<p>“My father soldered together a Timex Sinclair clone, a single board computer with membrane keyboard, on our kitchen table over two or three evenings and hooked it up to a crappy old black and white TV. You could type things in BASIC. It did stuff—it was this magical thing. And you learn life lessons that stick with you, like which end of the soldering iron to never pick up.”</p>
<p>Swetland continued programming through childhood and then college, but didn’t finish his computer engineering degree. “Sophomore year I didn’t make it to classes for a large chunk of it. Projects with the local ACM chapter, a job at NCSA SDG, and working on the X/Mosaic web browser had distracted me. Then finals happened, and it wasn’t pretty.” But hobby programming led <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_18" title="18"/>him to Be, and he captured the company’s interest while trying to get BeOS to work on his PC.</p>
<p>When Be released a version of their OS for PCs, Swetland installed the CD on his computer. But it didn’t quite work. “It didn’t recognize my hard drive, because I only had SCSI<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c03-footnote-1" id="c03-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup> drives in my PC. So I found the manuals for the bus logic SCSI controllers I had and thought, ‘This doesn’t look that complicated.’ I emailed Dominic Giampaolo, one of their engineers who was active on Usenet.”<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c03-footnote-2" id="c03-footnoteref-2">2</a></sup> Dominic emailed Swetland a sample SCSI driver for the BeBox hardware.</p>
<p>“That weekend, I ended up hacking together a SCSI driver for the BusLogic controller I had. I got it booting, but there was some problem; the disk size was coming up wrong. So I emailed him back, told him ‘I wrote the driver, but the size is wrong: I think there’s an endian<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c03-footnote-3" id="c03-footnoteref-3">3</a></sup> bug in the mid-layer.’</p>
<p>“He emailed me back fifteen minutes later and asked me if I wanted a job.” After a trip to California and a full day of interviews at the company, including a live debugging session with Dominic, Brian had a job offer. He returned home, packed up his things, and moved to California two weeks later. He had gone to college with the goal of eventually writing operating systems. With the opportunity to start on that immediately, he figured a college degree could wait.</p>
<p>Two years later, in May of 2000, Swetland left Be for Danger, joining former Be (and future Android) colleague Hiroshi Lockheimer. At Danger, Swetland worked on the kernel and other system software, and helped to ship the first couple of Hiptop devices. But after the first few years, most of the work tended to be incremental improvements, or features implemented at the request of the carrier (or killed on their behalf; even sometimes killed based on what product <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_19" title="19"/>managers thought the carrier <em>might</em> request). Eric Fischer, who worked on text and other platform features at Danger (and later Android) said, “Everything we did there was in the shadow of the slow, conservative carrier acceptance process that could veto any feature or design.” </p>
<p>Swetland was always more interested in building new systems than iterating on existing ones, and he was getting frustrated. Danger had become a much larger organization of about 150 people by 2004, far from the tiny team he joined back in 2000. It had also been four years of long hours, first helping Danger as a struggling startup, and then working to ship the company’s first two phones. So in September of 2004, he took three months off to recover from burnout and frustration.</p>
<p>Swetland wasn’t planning to quit Danger; he just needed a break. A few weeks into his hiatus, he realized he was pretty happy not being at work. He also realized he’d continue to be happy if he continued to not go back to work. More specifically, he realized he really didn’t want to go back to work at Danger.</p>
<p>But he still needed a job. Be and Danger had been decent software jobs, but hadn’t paid out in the way everyone imagines every startup doing.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c03-footnote-4" id="c03-footnoteref-4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>At Danger, Swetland got to know Andy well, since there were only a handful of employees when he started. So when he was searching around for new opportunities, he reached out to Andy. After all, Andy had founded an interesting company in the past; maybe he’d have more ideas. And he did; Andy had started Android with Chris White, and they were looking for their first employee.</p>
<p>At that time, in the Fall of 2004, the startup was focused on an open source camera operating system. Andy pitched the camera OS idea to Swetland, who was intrigued. If nothing else, it was a chance to work on another new operating system, which is what he loved. And at least it wasn’t phones again; he had had enough of that tumultuous domain during his time at Danger. So he signed up, planning to start when he finished his break.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_20" title="20"/>Before Swetland started, Andy talked with Nick, Rich, Chris, and VCs, and decided to change Android’s product focus.</p>
<p>In early December, Swetland came into the office on his first day at Android, excited to be working on something that wasn’t phones. Andy said, “What would you say if we were doing phones?”</p>
<p>Swetland started on the same day as another long-time Android person: Tracey Cole. Tracey was hired as Android’s first administrative assistant. She remained in that role, and was Andy’s personal admin, for many years.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c03-footnote-5" id="c03-footnoteref-5">5</a></sup> Tracey and Brian were the third and fourth people to join Android, and the first two non-founder employees.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c03-0002">Andy McFadden and the Demo</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">In May of 2005, Andy McFadden (known to the team as “Fadden”<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c03-footnote-6" id="c03-footnoteref-6">6</a></sup>) joined the company. Fadden had worked with Andy Rubin and Chris White at WebTV. When Andy [Rubin] was looking to hire someone else for his startup, he emailed Fadden:</p>
<pre><code>WTF?
How are you?
I want to hire you. It's going to be huge™</code></pre>
<p>When he was 13, Fadden was programming BASIC and assembly<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c03-footnote-7" id="c03-footnoteref-7">7</a></sup> on an Apple II. So it was no surprise that he would later be one of the people on Android working on low-level code for Android’s Dalvik runtime. “Some people [later, when Android was a large team at Google] didn’t like having parts of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_21" title="21"/>Dalvik VM<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c03-footnote-8" id="c03-footnoteref-8">8</a></sup> written in ARM<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c03-footnote-9" id="c03-footnoteref-9">9</a></sup> assembly. When you’ve been crawling around in the guts of computers since the 8th grade you have a different perspective.”</p>
<p>Andy brought Fadden in to help out.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c03-footnote-10" id="c03-footnoteref-10">10</a></sup> When Fadden started, Android’s “product” was nothing more than 3,000 lines of JavaScript,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c03-footnote-11" id="c03-footnoteref-11">11</a></sup> tied together with various open source libraries. It wasn’t a platform; it was a prototype to help visualize a nonexistent experience. Fadden’s job was to take this concept demo, which Swetland and Chris had been working on, and start adding real capabilities, including applications. The startup had to be able to show potential investors what real users could actually do with this future system. </p>
<p>In the Spring of 2005, the Android team didn’t yet have a product, but they did have a clear idea of what they wanted that product to be. Startups have been acquired for far less.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c03-0003">Ficus Kirkpatrick, the Startup’s Last Employee</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The final person to join the Android team before it was acquired by Google was Ficus Kirkpatrick. </p>
<p>Ficus started programming when he was young. Really young. “I have been programming since I was four. I don’t have any memory of not having computers and not programming computers. My whole childhood was on and off programming and using computers.”</p>
<p>In 1994, at the age of fifteen, Ficus dropped out of high school and went looking for work. A few months later, he got a full-time programming job and has been working steadily ever since. “In ‘work age,’ I’m like seven years older than people my age who got out of college at twenty-two.”</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_22" title="22"/>He came to Silicon Valley and bounced around various companies, including Be, usually working on low-level systems software. In 2000, after leaving Be, he joined a startup for all of two days. On his first day at the new company, he realized that it wasn’t for him. “My first sign that things were wrong: my computer was all set up and I already had email. They were a startup!” Also, his entire team was at an offsite meeting that day to debate a minor technical decision. Ficus was a firm believer in getting down to work and writing code. This company obviously wasn’t his kind of place. His second day of work, he only went into the office so that he could quit.</p>
<p>Hiroshi Lockheimer, who’d known Ficus from Be, heard that he was looking for something new and directed him to Danger, which Hiroshi had recently joined. Ficus joined Danger and worked on the kernel and drivers, helping to build out the platform for the Hiptop phone.</p>
<p>By mid-2005, Ficus had left Danger and moved to Seattle. Andy asked him to join Android. Part of the pitch to Ficus was that co-founder Nick Sears lived near Seattle as well, so Ficus would be allowed to stay there and work remotely.</p>
<p>Ficus joined the team. One week later, Google acquired Android.</p>
<p>Ficus remembered: “When Andy said, ‘The company’s gonna be bought by Google,’ I thought ‘Wow, this is the only way I could ever possibly get into Google.’ Then he said, ‘We have to go in and interview,’ and I thought, ‘Well, that’s it. It’s over.’”</p>
<p>Swetland remembered, “Ficus declared that if anyone asked what the Big O<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c03-footnote-12" id="c03-footnoteref-12">12</a></sup> of anything was, he was simply going to say, ‘I’m far too handsome to answer that question.’”</p>
<p>But the interviews worked out for Ficus, and he joined Google, eventually moving back to the Bay Area to be closer to the team’s center of gravity. He had always preferred working on low-level systems software. Helping to build the Android OS from the ground up promised plenty of opportunity for that kind of work.</p>

The difference in endian representation between different architectures is a common source of bugs in code meant to run across different machines. In this case, the endian assumptions for code on BeBox (using big-endian) were not correct when that same code was run on an x86 PC (which uses little-endian representation).</p></aside>

Everyone hears far more about the few people who strike it rich than the multitudes who just have regular jobs at these places as they continue to not get acquired by the big tech firms, not to mention the many companies that go bust chasing the dream, and the engineers that then go chasing the new jobs for necessary paychecks.</p></aside>

<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c03-footnoteref-7" id="c03-footnote-7">7.</a></sup>  Assembly language is the lowest-level code that programmers use. It maps very closely onto actual hardware instructions on a computer, which makes it very simplistic and verbose, compared to higher-level languages like C++ and Java. Most programmers learn assembly programming along the way, usually in a class on low-level programming. Most programmers never actually use it in their real jobs. But it comes in handy in very performance-sensitive situations, which is why it was used by some of the programmers on the Android team, including Fadden.</p></aside>

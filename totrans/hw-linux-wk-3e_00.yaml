- en: Your system shouldn’t be a mystery. You should be able to make your software
    do what you want it to do without “magic” incantations or rituals. The key to
    attaining this power lies in understanding the fundamentals of what the software
    does and how it works, and that’s what this book is all about. You should never
    have to fight with a computer.

    from you. In particular, you can find most system configuration details in easy-to-read
    plaintext files. The only tricky part is figuring out which parts are responsible
    for what and how they all fit together.

    In the professional realm, operations and DevOps folks need to know nearly everything
    that you’ll find in this book. Linux software architects and developers should
    also know this material in order to make the best use of the operating system.
    Researchers and students, often running their own Linux systems, will also find
    that this book provides useful explanations for *why* things are set up the way
    they are.

    computers for fun, profit, or both. Want to know why certain things work while
    others don’t? Want to know what happens if you move something around? You’re probably
    a tinkerer.

- en: Although Linux is beloved by programmers, you don’t need to be a programmer
    to read this book; you need only basic computer-user knowledge. That is, you should
    be able to bumble around a GUI (especially the installer and settings interface
    for a Linux distribution) and know what files and directories (folders) are. You
    should also be prepared to check additional documentation on your system and on
    the web. The most important thing you need is to be ready and willing to play
    around with your computer.

- en: Building the requisite knowledge is a challenge in tackling any technical subject.
    Explaining how software systems work can get *really* complicated. Too much detail
    can bog down readers and make important concepts difficult to grasp (the human
    brain just can’t process so many new ideas at once), but too little detail can
    leave readers in the dark and unprepared for later material.

- en: 'I’ve designed most chapters to tackle the most important material first: the
    basic information that you’ll need in order to progress. In places, I’ve simplified
    things in order to keep focus. As a chapter progresses, you’ll see much more detail,
    especially in the last few sections. Do you need to know those bits right away?
    In most cases, no; I note this where applicable. If your eyes start to glaze over
    when you’re faced with a lot of extra details about concepts you just learned,
    don’t hesitate to skip ahead to the next chapter or take a break. The nitty-gritty
    will still be there waiting for you.'

    in front of you, preferably one that you’re confident abusing with experiments.
    You might prefer to play around with a virtual installation—I used VirtualBox
    to test much of the material in this book. You also should have superuser (root)
    access, but try to use a regular user account most of the time. You’ll mostly
    work at the command line, in a terminal window or a remote session. If you haven’t
    worked much in that environment, no problem; Chapter 2 will bring you up to speed.

- en: I’ve grouped the book’s chapters into three basic parts. The first is introductory,
    giving a bird’s-eye view of the system and then offering hands-on experience with
    some tools you’ll need for as long as you run Linux. Next, you’ll explore each
    part of the system in more detail, from device management to network configuration,
    following the general order in which the system starts. Finally, you’ll get a
    tour of some pieces of a running system, learn some essential skills, and get
    some insight into the tools that programmers use.

    the Linux kernel, but you’ll work your way into user space as the book progresses.
    (If you don’t know what I’m talking about here, don’t worry; I’ll explain in Chapter
    1.)

    this, it can be tedious to cover all variations in systems software, so I’ve tried
    to cover the two major distribution families: Debian (including Ubuntu) and RHEL/Fedora/CentOS.
    I’ve also focused on desktop and server installations. A significant amount of
    material carries over into embedded systems, such as Android and OpenWRT, but
    it’s up to you to discover the differences on those platforms.'

- en: The second edition was published during a time of transition for Linux systems.
    Several traditional components were in the process of being replaced, which made
    handling some subjects tricky, because readers could encounter a wide variety
    of configurations. Now, however, those new pieces (systemd in particular) have
    near-universal adoption, so I’ve been able to streamline a fair amount of the
    discussion.

    has proven popular, and you probably interact with the kernel more than you realize.

- en: I’ve added a new chapter introducing virtualization. Although Linux has always
    been popular on virtual machines (such as cloud services), that type of virtualization
    lies outside the scope of this book, because the way the system operates on a
    virtual machine is almost the same as on “bare metal” hardware. So, the discussion
    here primarily focuses on deciphering the terminology you’ll encounter. However,
    containers have gained in popularity since the second edition was published, and
    they also fit here, because they basically consist of a bunch of Linux features
    like the ones described throughout the rest of the book. Containers make heavy
    use of cgroups, which also get new treatment in this third edition.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other subjects (not necessarily related to containers) I happily expanded on
    are the Logical Volume Manager, the journald logging system, and IPv6 in the networking
    material.

- en: Though I’ve added a significant amount of content, the book is still a reasonable
    size. I want to provide the information you need to get on the fast track, and
    that includes explaining certain details along the way that can be hard to grasp,
    but I don’t want you to have to become a weightlifter in order to pick up this
    book. Once you master the important subjects here, you should have no trouble
    seeking out and understanding more details.

- en: The first edition included historical information that I removed later to improve
    focus. If you’re interested in Linux and how it relates to the history of Unix,
    pick up Peter H. Salus’s *The Daemon, the Gnu, and the Penguin* (Reed Media Services,
    2008). It does a great job of explaining how the software we use has evolved over
    time.

    debate historically—even the word *Linux* itself. Should it be “Linux,” or should
    it be “GNU/Linux” to reflect that the operating system also contains pieces from
    the GNU Project? Throughout this book, I’ve tried to use the most common, least
    awkward names possible.

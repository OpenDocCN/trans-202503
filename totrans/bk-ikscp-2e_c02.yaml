  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first question to ask yourself before installing Inkscape is whether you
    want a *stable version* or a *development build*. Stable versions have been officially
    released and have version numbers associated with them. Calling a version stable
    does not mean it's perfect and never crashes; it just means this version has received
    a decent amount of testing, is more completely documented, and is what most people
    use. In fact, apart from its stability, the biggest advantage of running a stable
    version is that this is what other users run, so fellow Inkscape artists are more
    likely to be able to help you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Overall, I recommend that you start with a stable version, but consider upgrading
    to a development build if you find that you like Inkscape and want to support
    its development, or if you need the new features added since the release (visit
    the next version's Release Notes on [http://wiki.inkscape.org/](http://wiki.inkscape.org/)
    to see what's being worked on).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using a *development build* has its own advantages. First of all, such builds
    have all the latest and best features, which may be significant compared to the
    stable version (especially if the stable release is more than a few months old).
    These new features often include fixes for the important bugs of the stable version.
    Also, by running the development version, you help the development community to
    discover and iron out new bugs. Naturally, active developers are more interested
    in the development version, so you're more likely to receive prompt help directly
    from the developers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But what about stability? Granted, development builds are, on average, buggier
    and crash more often. However, if you run into a new bug that's driving you crazy—and
    if that bug is not fixed quickly enough—you can always go back to the latest stable
    version without this bug. (Remember to save often, no matter which version you
    use!)

- en: Most of the window is occupied by the *canvas*, surrounded by rulers (top and
    left) and scroll bars (bottom and right). On the canvas, you can see a rectangular
    page (A4 paper size by default) with a shadow. This *page frame* defines the edges
    of your document. However, Inkscape allows you to draw freely anywhere, both on
    and off the page—the page frame is not a limit, just a hint. This frame matters
    only when you export into some vector formats and when you view your SVG file
    in an external viewer; in both cases, you will only see the objects that overlap
    the page rectangle. You can hide the page frame if you don't care about it.
  prefs: []

    the canvas is so huge, it is almost infinite. You can view more of it by zooming
    out or by scrolling in any direction, as you will see in the next section. You'll
    never run out of room in Inkscape! (In fact, you can even get lost in the vastness
    of canvas; to return to the page frame, just press the 5 key at any time.)
  prefs: []

    on this toolbox activate various Inkscape tools. Each tool has its own purpose,
    features, controls, keyboard shortcuts, mouse cursors, and other stuff. Some tools
    create new objects, others edit them in various ways, and still others help you
    navigate in your document. We'll briefly look at some of the tools in this chapter
    and explore them all in detail in the rest of the book.

    the *message area* of the status bar, which always displays some message relevant

    as zoom in and out for a more convenient view are very important. Inkscape offers
    plenty of ways to pan (scroll) and zoom—enough to satisfy every taste.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    aren't all that convenient, so I usually hide them by pressing Ctrl-B. Instead,
    what I use most often is *middle-drag*. Press the middle mouse button anywhere
    on the canvas and drag it in any direction. Middle-drag works in any tool or mode.
  prefs: []

- en: Pretty often, however, my right hand is on the keyboard, not the mouse. In that
    case, the easiest way to scroll the canvas is by pressing Ctrl-arrows. If you
    press and hold Ctrl-↑, for example, the canvas starts scrolling downward (that
    is, your view starts going up), at first slowly but gradually accelerating. When
    you get the hang of it, it feels very natural.

    minus – keys to zoom in or out (unlike most other programs, use just plain plus
    and minus keys, either on the main keyboard or on the keypad; you don't need to
    press Ctrl or Shift with either). With your mouse, middle-click to zoom in and
    Shift-middle-click to zoom out. Or, switch to the Zoom tool where you can use
    regular left click to zoom in, Shift-left-click to zoom out, or drag with the
    left mouse button to zoom into a rectangular area.

    at the tools available for creating objects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Looking down the main toolbox, the first object-creating tool you see is the
    Rectangle tool. This and the next four tools—Ellipse, Star, 3D Box, and Spiral—are
    collectively called *shape tools*, and the objects they create are called *shapes*
    ([Figure 2-8](#fig2-8)).

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A *shape* is a geometric object that you can not only move, scale, or rotate
    (as you can any other object) but also edit in some ways specific to its type.
    For example, with a rectangle, you can have its corners rounded; with an ellipse,
    you can turn it into a segment (pie-slice shape) or elliptic arc; with a 3D box,
    you can move and resize it in its own 3D space. We will talk about shapes in [Chapter 11](c11.xhtml#ch11);
    for now, choose any of the shape tools and start drawing on the canvas. Each mouse
    drag, from press to release of the left mouse button, creates a new shape.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next down in the toolbox are the *Pen* and *Pencil* tools ([Figure 2-9](#fig2-9)).
    Both create arbitrary paths, but they do it differently. The Pencil tool works
    just like a real pencil—you draw on the canvas, and it leaves behind a trace.
    (Note that the trace is not exact; it's a bit smoothed out compared to the actual
    mouse trajectory.)

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Pen tool is more complex; it assumes that you understand how paths are composed
    of nodes connected by linear or curved segments. For now, just click several times
    with this tool at different points (this creates linear segments between click
    points), then click and drag a few times, and finally press Enter to finish the
    path. Both Pencil and Pen by default create paths with a thin black stroke but
    no fill. We'll discuss these tools in [Chapter 14](c14.xhtml#ch14).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The next two tools, *Calligraphic pen* and *Paint bucket*, also create paths,
    but unlike Pencil and Pen, they by default produce filled paths without stroke
    ([Figure 2-10](#fig2-10)).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Calligraphic pen is one of the most versatile tools in Inkscape; its many
    options and parameters allow it to imitate not only a calligraphic pen (which
    was its original purpose), but also various brushes and many other drawing implements
    and behaviors (some of which have no counterpart in the real world). This is the
    primary tool of those who use Inkscape to *simply draw* ([Chapter 14](c14.xhtml#ch14)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Paint bucket tool is also a great help for a cartoonist or illustrator.
    Just as you'd expect, it fills in any bounded area, creating a filled vector path.
    For practice, draw around a closed area with several brush strokes of the Calligraphic
    pen, then click inside with the Paint bucket. (If you click in an unbounded area,
    the tool will fail to fill it and say so in the status bar.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One last tool we'll look at is the *Text* tool that creates and edits text objects
    ([Figure 2-11](#fig2-11)). Creating a new text object is as simple as clicking
    anywhere and starting to type. Or, you can click and drag, in which case you're
    creating a rectangular *flowed text* object that will automatically wrap when
    you type up to the right edge.

    of [Chapter 15](c15.xhtml#ch15).

    with the Rectangle tool or Calligraphic pen), that object shows a dashed frame
    around it. This frame indicates that the object is *selected*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Selection is a fundamental concept in Inkscape. Almost all tools, commands,
    dialogs, and shortcuts work on the object or objects that are currently selected.
    Various informational displays, such as the status bar, always describe the selected
    objects. The ability to select what you need quickly and precisely, as well as
    to figure out what is currently selected, is vital for effective work in Inkscape.
  prefs: []

    its button but also by pressing either F1, S, or spacebar. You really can't miss

    list of selected objects. (If you Shift-click an already selected object, you

    is the same as order of creation), whereas Shift-Tab selects the previous object.

    *rotating*, and *skewing*. The first two of these—and especially moving—are very
    common in vector work because it's nearly impossible to create objects that are
    at once in the exact place and with the exact size you need. You will find yourself
    moving things around all the time, so learn how to do this quickly and precisely.

    of the selection. To do this, press Ctrl-D; a copy is created and placed exactly
    over the original selection (which, therefore, apparently does not change). Just
    drag it away with the Selector tool to where you want to place the copy. You can
    also use the traditional copy-and-paste method of duplicating objects (Ctrl-C,

- en: Other types of transforming are a little more difficult. Whenever you have anything
    selected, the selection is surrounded by eight arrow marks ([Figure 2-15](#fig2-15)).
    Dragging any of these arrow marks performs *scaling*. This is how you make your
    selection larger or smaller, taller or wider, and so on. The four corner arrows
    can move in any direction to resize the selected objects freely; the four center
    arrows scale in one direction only (the top and bottom center marks move vertically;
    the left and right center ones move horizontally).

    before ([Figure 2-16](#fig2-16)).

    center, while the four center arrows skew the selection. Also, in rotate mode,
    you can still move your selection around by dragging. To go back to the scale
    mode, click the selection or press Shift-S again. Next time you select these or
    other objects, they will again be in the scale mode first.

    to learn that the four arrow keys each move the selection in the corresponding
    direction. Less obviously, the left and right angle brackets (< and >) scale the
    selection down and up, correspondingly, while the square brackets ([ and ]) rotate
    it counterclockwise and clockwise, correspondingly. There are no shortcuts for
    skewing objects.

- en: Any object in Inkscape has style. *Style* is a complex concept that includes
    many separate properties, from the color of the fill to the width of the stroke
    to complex SVG filters that totally alter the way an object looks. Here are just
    a few of the simplest and most common techniques for changing the style of objects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First of all, you should have guessed by now that the style-changing actions,
    as any other actions in Inkscape, apply to the *current selection*. That is, before
    you change the style of something, you must first select that something.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once you select the object or objects you want to style, the simplest thing
    to do is click the color palette at the bottom of the canvas. The color you click
    becomes the new fill color of all selected objects ([Figure 2-17](#fig2-17)).
    Even if an object had no fill at all (like a path created with the Pencil tool),
    it becomes filled with that color too. (Note that you can scroll the palette to
    the right to see more colors than fit the screen.)

    Shift-click instead of clicking a color. Again, if some objects had no stroke,
    they will get it now.

- en: Next, look at the complex control in the lower-left corner of your Inkscape
    window, on the left end of the status bar. This control (shown in [Figure 2-18](#fig2-18))
    is called the *selected style indicator*; in accordance with its name, it indicates
    the style(or rather, the most important style properties; there's much more to
    an object's style than shown in this indicator) of the selection. That's where
    you look to check the fill and stroke colors of selected objects.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This indicator also allows you to change the style properties it displays. One
    very common operation is *removing* the fill or stroke from selected objects.
    Just middle-click the **Fill** (top) or **Stroke** (bottom) swatch to do this,
    or right-click the corresponding swatch and choose **Remove** from the pop-up
    menu. Note that an object with no fill and no stroke is completely invisible—you
    can't see it and you can't click it to select (although you can drag the rubber
    band *around* it to select it).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Apart from the fill and stroke colors, one important style property is*opacity*.
    Think of stained glass that has its own color but still shows through whatever
    is behind it; this is how objects with less-than-100% opacity behave in Inkscape.
    (Obviously, an opacity of 0% makes an object invisible.) To change opacity, use
    the **O:** control in the selected style indicator. Try selecting an object that
    is on top of other objects and type in a different opacity value; notice how the
    object becomes semitransparent ([Figure 2-19](#fig2-19)).

    the first object and press Ctrl-C; this places a copy of the object on the clipboard.
    Then select the other object (or objects) and paste the *style* of the clipboard
    object onto them by pressing Shift-Ctrl-V. This is the easiest way to make multiple
    objects look the same.

- en: As far as sharing goes, SVG isn't a bad format at all; for example, as already
    mentioned, you can view it, in all its vector glory, in any modern browser. However,
    for any number of reasons, SVG may not be a viable choice in your situation. In
    that case, you need to *export* your document to some other format. Go to the
    **Save** dialog again. Note the drop-down list displaying *Inkscape SVG (*.svg)*;
    check out what else is available. Quite a lot, in fact! More than 20 different
    vector formats are listed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Don't get overexcited, though. Several of these formats are just variations
    upon the primary Inkscape SVG format (such as plain SVG or compressed SVG). Others
    are limited in various ways, either because the target format is itself limited
    compared to SVG, or because Inkscape's exporter for that format is less than fully
    developed, or both. These export formats are usable, but only if you know what
    the limitations are and design your documents with these limitations in mind.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Perhaps the safest export format, besides SVG, is PDF ([Appendix B](b02.xhtml#chB)).
    It still cannot fully preserve some SVG features (such as filters, which are by
    default rasterized), but for most Inkscape documents, it should be perfectly adequate.
    The biggest advantage of PDF, apart from its being a vector format, is that it
    is supported by a much wider range of software than just the canonical Adobe Acrobat.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    What about exporting to raster? This is done in a different dialog called Export
    PNG Image ([18.6.1](c18.xhtml#section18.6.1)). As its name suggests, the only
    raster format Inkscape can export is PNG. In most cases, though, it's not a problem;
    PNG is universally supported (viewable in all browsers), supports full RGB color
    and gradual (alpha) transparency, and is just a nice all-around all-purpose format
    perfectly suitable for renditions of any vector artwork. If you really need JPG,
    GIF, or TIFF, you can use any number of specialized tools for converting your
    image from PNG.
  prefs: []

    the page frame that now nicely enframes your art, select **Page**. Otherwise,
    select **Drawing** to make the export area cover all the objects of your drawing
    no matter where they are. You can also export only the current selection or specify
    a custom export area.

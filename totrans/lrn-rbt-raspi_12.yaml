    connects them. Unlike using a breadboard, soldering is permanent. Over the course
    of your adventures in robotics, electronics, and Raspberry Pi, you will come across
    components that you need to solder (for example, wires onto motor terminals),
    so it is a key skill for you to learn and practice.

    Shown in [Figure D-2](bm04.xhtml#bm04fig2), solder is a metal alloy with a relatively
    low melting temperature, usually between 180 and 200 degrees Celsius (356–392
    degrees Fahrenheit).

- en: In the past, lead was used in solder, due to its low melting point and fantastic
    electrical properties. However, we now know that lead is a heavy metal and toxic
    to humans. Consequently, lead-free solder, primarily made out of tin and copper,
    is the modern industry standard and what I recommend you purchase. If you’re buying
    online, just search for “lead-free solder.” It is usually provided in the form
    of a wire with a diameter between 0.5 and 0.8 mm.

    up for around $30\. This is a quick-warming, fixed-temperature, quality tool that
    will last you many years. Note that for the delicate electronics soldering you’ll
    most likely be doing, you should use a fine tip on your soldering iron. The majority
    of soldering irons come with one of these preinstalled, and irons like the XS25
    feature an easy-to-replace tip.

    stand, which safely stores and holds your iron between solder joints without burning
    you, your electronics, or your table surface ([Figure D-4](bm04.xhtml#bm04fig4))!

    solder and repeat this process until the tip of your iron is shiny and covered
    in solder, like mine in [Figure D-6](bm04.xhtml#bm04fig6).

    Place your parts on your work surface and position them in the way you intend
    to solder them. For the purpose of soldering some wire to a motor terminal, this
    involves threading the wire through the terminal, as pictured in [Figure D-7](bm04.xhtml#bm04fig7).
    Before you do this, ensure that you have *stripped* the end of the wire first,
    which means removing about a quarter of an inch of the wire’s plastic outer layer
    in order to expose the conductive metal core. You should use a *wire stripper*
    for this purpose.

    However, using more than two digits at a time can become messy—there’s a lot more
    wiring, more control ICs, and so on to take care of. Fortunately, there’s a popular
    IC that can control up to 64 LEDs (eight digits of a numeric display) with only
    three control wires from our Arduino: the MAX7219 LED driver IC from Maxim Integrated.'

    to the current value returned by `millis()` 4. When the button connected to digital
    input 3 is pressed 5, the display is frozen; this functionality is ideal for taking
    a lap reading. Note, however, that the counting continues and the display resumes

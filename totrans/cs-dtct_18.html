<p class="noindent">Frank limped back into his office to find Socks waiting. The young wizard sat in Frank’s chair, spinning idly. Frank glared until Socks realized his mistake. He mumbled an apology and jumped out of the chair.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“What did you find?” Frank asked.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Socks shrugged. “Nothing useful.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Nothing?” Frank prompted.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“None of the wizards had heard of any new leagues,” Socks added quickly. “The last wizarding league formed was the League of Magical Confectioners. They formed last year in response to the influx of subpar mints. Do you remember those grainy tablets restaurants served? They tasted like mint for the first few minutes but left an aftertaste of pine needles for the next six hours. It was like they were meant to be a prank. The League of Magical Confectioners fixed the mint situation, and then branched out into chocolates and toffees. The league now has six candy shops and four carts—”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Nothing else?” Frank interrupted.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Socks shook his head. “I also asked about clubs and associations,” he offered. “The only new one was the Babbageville Wizards <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_152"/>Bowling Association, and they lasted less than a month. Apparently there just aren’t that many wizards in Babbageville who like to bowl.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank sighed. He hadn’t expected much from Socks’s investigation, but the complete lack of news still managed to disappoint him.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“How about you?” Socks asked.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Yeah,” replied Frank. “I got a new lead.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Really? What is it?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Before Frank could answer, Officer Notation banged noisily into the office carrying an absurdly large stack of books. She made it to Frank’s desk and dropped the stack. The desk sagged under the weight.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“All the transfer and assignment ledgers for the past year,” she panted. “Now can you tell me why I dragged these here?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“We need to find a transfer,” said Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I figured that,” said Notation. “But if you’d told me which transfer, I could have just looked it up there.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I don’t know which transfer,” explained Frank. It was half true. Even if he had known, he would have still asked Notation to bring up all the records. He needed to be there during the search. He needed to make sure no one was missed.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Okay,” said Notation. “What are we looking for?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“We’ll start with any suspicious transfer between 50 and 70 days ago,” said Frank. Those were the approximate dates of the pages that had been torn from the ledger in the prison. “It’s a range search. We want to find all the transfers in a range of dates.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notation groaned. “These requests are sorted by the original location of the requesting officer and then by officer name. They aren’t indexed by the date of the request. We’ll have to go through every request. It’ll take hours.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“No, it won’t,” Frank assured her. “Because we’re going to use magic.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_153"/>Socks looked up in surprise. “Magic?” he asked. “I don’t know any range search spells.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“You know binary search trees,” responded Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I’m an expert on binary search trees,” agreed Socks, “but I don’t see how that helps.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“We can build a binary search tree of transfer requests, with each node’s value equal to how long ago the transfer occurred. Then we can do a range search on the tree.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Range search on the tree?” asked Socks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Why bother with a tree?” asked Notation. “If we’re just doing one search, it’ll take longer to build the tree than to scan through the data.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank shrugged. “My guess is that we’ll ultimately want to do more than one search. If Socks builds the tree with magic, we can search it a bunch of times.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“But I don’t know how to do a range search,” Socks protested.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Build the tree and I’ll show you.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Okay,” said Socks. “This’ll take a little while; I’m only used to working with buttons. Real, physical buttons. I’ve never had to organize facts before. Facts seem like they’ll be squishy. I’ll need to modify the spell.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As Socks hunched over Frank’s desk and scrawled out a modified spell on a piece of parchment, Notation confronted Frank. “What’s going on?” she asked.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Nothing,” Frank said.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Oh, come off it,” Notation snapped. “Ever since the prison, you’ve been holding something back. Why are we looking at transfer requests? How come you never mentioned them before? What did you find?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“As I said, it’s a hunch.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I don’t buy it. You aren’t telling me something.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank didn’t answer.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_154"/><img src="../images/f0154-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Got it,” called Socks. “I think so, at least. We’ll see in a minute.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Socks turned to the stack of ledgers and began muttering an incantation. He waved his arms dramatically but entirely unnecessarily over the paper. With a flash, a large binary search tree appeared in the air with each node in the tree representing the number of days since that transfer date. The nodes hung in the air, connected by electric blue lines.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0154-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_155"/>“Now we range search,” said Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“I told you, I don’t—” started Socks, but Frank waved him off.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“We’ll use a modified depth-first search,” Frank explained. “Start at the top node, the root node, and explore down the tree.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Explore how?” asked Socks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“At each node, you follow three steps. First, you check if the node itself falls into the range. If it does, like 55 days here, then we’ll save it to our list of results. Otherwise, we ignore it.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Hold on a second,” said Socks. “I’ll make the nodes in our list glow a different color. What about dark green?”</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0155-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Sure. Whatever,” Frank replied. “After we check the current node, we check whether we need to explore either child node. We recursively explore the left and right subtrees if, and only if, they could have nodes in the correct range.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Recursively explore?” asked Socks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank waited for Notation to jump in with one of her formal definitions, but she remained stubbornly silent. He sighed and explained, “<em>Recursively</em> just means we apply the same algorithm to subproblems. In this case, we apply the same search to each of the child nodes. We treat them the same way we do the root node.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Just check whether we need to explore the children, and, if so, apply the same steps. We’ll use a simple test and compare the <em>current</em> node’s value with our range. If the current node’s value is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_156"/><em>less</em> than the <em>lower</em> end of the range, we know everything in the left subtree would fall below our range and we can skip that subtree. Alternatively, if the current node’s value is <em>greater</em> than the <em>lower</em> end of our range, we will need to continue our search on the left child.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“The same logic applies to the right subtree. If the current node’s value is <em>greater</em> than the <em>higher</em> end of our range, we can skip the right subtree. Otherwise, we repeat our search on the right child.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“In this case, our range is 50 to 70, and as the left child can have values up to 55, nodes in that subtree could fall within our range, so we need to explore the left child. The right child can have values above 55, which also overlaps our range, so we need to explore that as well. Start with the left child.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Now we have 22 days,” continued Frank. “We don’t put it on our list. And because everything in the left subtree has to be less than 22, we don’t need to explore down that path either.”</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0156-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">“We call this <em>pruning</em> the exploration,” added Notation. “Because it’s like cutting off the branch of a tree.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When Frank looked over, she scowled as she remembered she wasn’t talking to him and fell silent.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“So we only explore the right child,” said Frank.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Recursively!” added Socks with all too much glee.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_157"/>“Yes, recursively,” agreed Frank dryly. “Now we get 38. Again, it doesn’t go on the list, and we can skip the left branch.”</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0157-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">“But we need to recursively explore the right branch,” said Socks, who was thoroughly enjoying the new algorithm.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Frank nodded.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0157-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">The next node had no children. It was a dead end.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Now what?” asked Socks.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Same thing as in a depth-first search,” said Frank. “We backtrack and take unexplored paths until we’ve searched the whole tree. In this case, we’ve already pruned a lot of paths, so we need to backtrack to the root.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The search progressed down the root’s right subtree. New matches were added to the result list, incompatible paths were pruned, and compatible paths were explored recursively.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_158"/><img src="../images/f0158-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<div class="image"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_159"/><img src="../images/f0159-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">By the end, they had identified a handful of transfers that fell within the target range. Frank studied the list intently, looking for anything suspicious.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">“Nothing,” he growled in disbelief. “There’s nothing here.”</p>&#13;
<div class="sidebar">&#13;
<p class="sidebart"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_160"/><strong>POLICE ALGORITHMS 101: BINARY SEARCH TREES</strong></p>&#13;
<p class="sbsub"><em><strong>Excerpt from Professor Drecker’s Lecture</strong></em></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The range search algorithm on a binary search tree is similar to the search for a single value. The algorithm starts at the top node and recursively explores down the tree. At each node, it makes decisions based on three questions:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent"><strong>Should this node be added to the results?</strong> The current value should be added to the results if, and only if, it falls within the range.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent"><strong>Should the left subtree be explored?</strong> The algorithm should recursively explore the left subtree if there is a left child and the value of the current node is <em>greater than</em> the smallest value in the range. In that case, there <em>could</em> be a node in the left subtree that falls within the range.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p class="noindent"><strong>Should the right subtree be explored?</strong> The algorithm should recursively explore the right subtree if there is a right child and the value of the current node is <em>less than</em> the largest value in the range. In that case, there <em>could</em> be a node in the right subtree that falls within the range.</p></li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p class="indent">The advantage of using a binary search tree for range search is that you may be able to save computation by pruning out large amounts of the search space.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_161"/>Consider the following binary tree:</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0161-01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you are searching for all values within the range [8, 20], you need to visit and evaluate only 7 of the 25 nodes (visited nodes are shaded):</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0161-02.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Similarly, if you are searching within the range [70, 80], you need to visit and evaluate only 6 of the 25 nodes:</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/f0161-03.jpg" alt="image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_162"/>It’s important to note that visiting a node doesn’t necessarily mean that it will appear in the result list. Both of the example searches still have to visit nodes that fall outside the range, because those nodes’ subtrees could contain values within the range.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As with a search for a single value, using a binary search tree for range search is efficient only if you’re conducting multiple searches. Constructing a binary search tree is more expensive than doing a linear scan through the data. However, the cost of building a tree can be spread out over many searches to make the average cost per search lower.</p>&#13;

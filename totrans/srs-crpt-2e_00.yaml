- en: I wrote this book to be the one I wish I had when I started learning cryptography.
    In 2005, I was studying for my master’s degree near Paris, and I eagerly registered
    for the upcoming semester’s crypto class. Unfortunately, the class was canceled
    because too few students had registered. “Crypto is too hard,” the students argued,
    instead enrolling en masse in the computer graphics and database classes.

- en: I’ve heard “crypto is hard” dozens of times since then. But is it really *that*
    hard? To play an instrument, master a programming language, or put the applications
    of any field into practice, you need to learn some concepts and symbols, but doing
    so doesn’t take a PhD. The same applies to becoming a competent cryptographer.
    Perhaps crypto is perceived as hard because cryptographers haven’t done a good
    job of teaching it.

    field. To do anything useful and relevant in crypto, you need to understand the
    concepts *around* crypto: how networks and computers work, what users and systems
    need, and how attackers can abuse algorithms and their implementations. In other
    words, you need a connection to reality.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The initial title of this book was *Crypto for Real* to stress the practice-oriented,
    real-world, no-nonsense approach I follow. I wanted to make cryptography approachable
    not by dumbing it down but by tying it to real applications. I provide source
    code examples and describe real bugs and horror stories.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Along with a clear connection to reality, other cornerstones of this book are
    its simplicity and its modernity. I focus on simplicity in form more than in substance:
    I present nontrivial concepts without the dull mathematical formalism. Instead,
    I attempt to impart an understanding of cryptography’s core ideas, which are more
    important than remembering a bunch of equations. To ensure the book’s modernity,
    I cover the latest developments and applications of cryptography, such as TLS
    1.3 and post-quantum cryptography. I don’t discuss the details of obsolete or
    insecure algorithms such as DES or MD5\. An exception to this is RC4, but it’s
    included only to explain how weak it is and to show how a stream cipher of its
    kind works.'

- en: While writing, I often imagined the reader as a developer who’d been exposed
    to cryptography but still felt clueless and frustrated after reading abstruse
    textbooks and research papers. Developers often need—and want—a better grasp of
    crypto to avoid unfortunate design choices, and I hope this book helps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you aren’t a developer, don’t worry! The book doesn’t require coding skills
    and is accessible to anyone who understands the basics of computer science and
    high school math (notions of probabilities, modular arithmetic, and so on).

- en: 'This book can nonetheless be intimidating, and despite its relative accessibility,
    it requires some effort to get the most out of it. I like the mountaineering analogy:
    the author paves the way, providing you with ropes and ice axes to facilitate
    your work, but you make the ascent yourself. Learning the concepts in this book
    takes effort but is rewarding.'

- en: The book has 15 chapters, loosely split into four parts. The chapters are mostly
    independent from one another, except for [Chapter 9](chapter9.xhtml), which lays
    the foundations for the three subsequent chapters. I recommend reading the first
    three chapters before anything else.

- en: This second edition of *Serious Cryptography* comes seven years after the first
    edition. Since then, cryptography has experienced significant changes. Nowadays,
    the term *crypto* often conjures thoughts of blockchain, Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies,
    rather than cryptography itself. Despite the debatable societal benefits of these
    technologies, their undeniable influence on the advancement of cryptography research
    and engineering can’t be overlooked. Recognizing this, I’ve written [Chapter 15](chapter15.xhtml),
    “Cryptocurrency Cryptography,” which delves into fascinating cryptographic techniques
    employed in blockchain applications, representing some of the most intriguing
    advancements in the field of cryptography.

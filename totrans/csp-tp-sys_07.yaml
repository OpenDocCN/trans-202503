- en: As an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, C# has good support for features
    that allow us to capture complex ideas and express them intuitively, such as classes,
    virtual methods, and inheritance. However, the language support for inheritance
    doesn’t extend to value types. Structs and record structs implicitly derive from
    the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">ValueType</samp> class, which
    is derived directly from <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">object</samp>,

- en: but they can’t inherit any other type and can’t themselves be inherited; that
    is, structs and record structs are implicitly sealed. Inheritance is a central
    feature of OOP that enables us to treat a reference to a derived class as though
    it refers to the base class, overriding the base class’s properties and methods
    to have new behavior as needed. These features don’t apply to value types, but
    that doesn’t mean value types are inferior.

    but polymorphism is a more general concept; it relates to writing code that works
    uniformly for a variety of types to reduce duplication. As this chapter discusses,
    inheritance is just one kind of polymorphism, and while there are sound technical
    and semantic reasons for why value types can’t employ inheritance relationships,
    they can take advantage of other kinds of polymorphism.

    to refer to an instance of a derived class, so the static, compile-time type of
    a reference variable isn’t necessarily the same as the dynamic, run-time instance
    type. This characteristic permits *virtual dispatch* for method calls—the mechanism
    whereby the appropriate method implementation will be called based on the actual
    type of the object at run time—and relies on the extra level of indirection afforded
    by references; therefore, inheritance is appropriate only for reference types.

    <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">string</samp> could support virtual
    method dispatch, but we can’t derive from the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">string</samp>

    straightforward. We need to note the subtleties and avoid the pitfalls when using

    to be mindful of what deriving from those types might entail. There’s a difference

    why doing so is ill-advised, let’s look at a class with value-like characteristics

    the *class*, which represents a particular implementation. If the derived class
    doesn’t respect the behavioral aspect of the type’s contract, when we use an instance

    an inherited type. Even if we don’t override the base type’s methods, we can’t
    easily guarantee that those methods will work correctly for any derived type.

    fulfilling the base type behavioral contract in a derived type is often much more
    difficult than it appears.

    inheritance entirely. Remember, when we implement an interface, the implementing
    class is truly a subtype of the interface type; there’s no behavioral contract
    to consider because interfaces have no implementation. An interface type defines
    what an implementing type must be able to do but doesn’t prescribe any specific
    implementation. An interface, in effect, defines *only* a type, not a class.
  prefs: []

    different implementations under different circumstances. Code that depends only
    on an interface type—whether as a parameter in a method or a field in a type—is

    interfaces are *seams*—customization points in our code where we can swap one
    implementation for another.

    parameters or the run-time environment. However, code *using* the controller or
    service—frequently in the entity types—doesn’t need to change because its behavior
    depends only on the interface, not the specific concrete type. The controllers

- en: Conversions represent a form of polymorphism, as we explicitly allow a variable
    of one type to be coerced to a variable of a different but unrelated type. Like
    parametric polymorphism using generics, and ad hoc polymorphism with overloading,
    coercion polymorphism is a compile-time activity, in contrast to the dynamic,
    run-time characteristic of inclusion polymorphism using inheritance. Inclusion
    polymorphism is a powerful tool, but because the type relationships are resolved
    at run time, the compiler can’t identify many of the errors that may occur. When
    we improperly use generics, overloading, or coercions, we can rely on the compiler
    to tell us about most errors in our code.

- en: 'Asking how to make value types behave correctly when used polymorphically is
    the wrong question: polymorphism itself takes many forms! Combining value types
    and inheritance can cause hard-to-diagnose errors, but inheritance is only one
    kind of polymorphism. The dynamic nature of inclusion polymorphism with virtual
    dispatch brings an expectation of type substitutability and doesn’t sit well with
    value-based equality.'

- en: Inheriting one type from another imposes a responsibility on the derived type
    to respect the contract established by the base class. Failing to uphold that
    contract can lead to undesirable behavior. One type is genuinely substitutable
    for another only if they share the same behavioral contract, which is something
    the compiler can’t enforce. It’s up to us, the programmers, to judge whether inheritance
    is appropriate. In the case of structs, it’s not even permitted, freeing us from
    that particular responsibility.

- en: With records, we need to pay just as much attention to the base class contract
    as we do with classes. Although the compiler carefully crafts its implementation
    of equality to ensure that <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Equals</samp>
    behaves correctly for records, it doesn’t do the same for any of our own virtual
    and overridden methods in those types.

- en: Records aren’t necessarily appropriate for everything, and as noted earlier,
    making <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Equals</samp> “just work”
    for values using inheritance is an incomplete solution to the wrong problem. In
    particular, records are reference types and thus subject to garbage collection.
    The implementations of <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">Equals</samp>
    are all virtual, as is the <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">EqualityContract</samp>
    property, and they all carry an associated cost. Records are a very compact way
    of declaring immutable value-like types, but programming is more than the amount
    of typing required of us.

- en: 'Value types do combine much better with the other ways of representing polymorphic
    behavior: coercion, overloading, and generic. These three forms of polymorphism
    are static in nature; that is, they are resolved by the compiler. Although type
    parameters in generic classes and methods are resolved at run time, we must still
    provide compile-time guarantees about which operations those parameters support.'

- en: It can be tempting to use inheritance in order to reuse code from a base class.
    This is a bad idea because inheriting a class implies that the base class can
    be substituted by the inheriting class, but it can be difficult to ensure that
    the base class’s behavioral characteristics are properly met. We can still reuse
    another type’s implementation by containing an instance of the type and using
    the contained instance privately to implement our new type.

- en: Inheriting from concrete types—that is, nonabstract classes—in general presents
    us with the challenges of respecting the contracts established by those base classes.
    When we override an abstract method or implement an interface, we don’t suffer
    from those issues because there is no base class implementation to respect. In
    those cases, we’re inheriting only the interface contract, which is much easier
    to uphold.

- en: The moral of the story is that if we always implement true interfaces or inherit
    from fully abstract classes, the problems we’ve encountered in this chapter will
    never cause us difficulties. Correspondingly, we should seal any class or record
    that models a value type and ensure that it has no user-defined base types. We
    can still write code that behaves polymorphically with the value types we use
    and create, but we should express it differently by employing generics, overloading
    methods, and permitting type conversions.

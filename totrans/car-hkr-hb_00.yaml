    on vehicle security—released the first *Car Hacker’s Manual* as course material
    for car hacking classes. The original book was designed to fit in a vehicle’s
    glove box and to cover the basics of car hacking in a one- or two-day class on
    auto security. Little did we know how much interest there would be in that that
    first book: we had over 300,000 downloads in the first week. In fact, the book’s
    popularity shut down our Internet service provider (twice!) and made them a bit
    unhappy with us. (It’s okay, they forgave us, which is good because I love my
    small ISP. Hi SpeedSpan.net!)'

- en: The feedback from readers was mostly fantastic; most of the criticism had to
    do with the fact that the manual was too short and didn’t go into enough detail.
    This book aims to address those complaints. *The Car Hacker’s Handbook* goes into
    a lot more detail about car hacking and even covers some things that aren’t directly
    related to security, like performance tuning and useful tools for understanding
    and working with vehicles.

- en: The automotive industry has churned out some amazing vehicles, with complicated
    electronics and computer systems, but it has released little information about
    what makes those systems work. Once you understand how a vehicle’s network works
    and how it communicates within its own system and outside of it, you’ll be better
    able to diagnose and troubleshoot problems.

- en: As vehicles have evolved, they’ve become less mechanical and more electronic.
    Unfortunately, automotive electronics systems are typically closed off to all
    but the dealership mechanics. While dealerships have access to more information
    than you as an individual can typically get, the auto manufacturers themselves
    outsource parts and require proprietary tools to diagnose problems. Learning how
    your vehicle’s electronics work can help you bypass this barrier.

    improved fuel consumption and use of third-party replacement parts. Once you understand
    the communication system, you can seamlessly integrate other systems into your
    vehicle, like an additional display to show performance or a third-party component
    that integrates just as well as the factory default.

    disabled. Discovering undocumented or disabled features and utilizing them lets
    you use your vehicle to its fullest potential. For example, the vehicle may have
    an undocumented “valet mode” that allows you to put your car in a restricted mode
    before handing over the keys to a valet.

    threats. While vehicles are susceptible to the same malware as your desktop, automakers
    aren’t required to audit the security of a vehicle’s electronics. This situation
    is simply unacceptable: we drive our families and friends around in these vehicles,
    and every one of us needs to know that our vehicles are as safe as can be. If
    you learn how to hack your car, you’ll know where your vehicle is vulnerable so
    that you can take precautions and be a better advocate for higher safety standards.'

    titled “This Car Runs on Code,” author Robert N. Charette notes that as of 2009
    vehicles have typically been built with over 100 microprocessors, 50 electronic
    control units, 5 miles of wiring, and 100 million lines of code (*[http://spectrum.ieee.org/transportation/systems/this-car-runs-on-code](http://spectrum.ieee.org/transportation/systems/this-car-runs-on-code)*).
    Engineers at Toyota joke that the only reason they put wheels on a vehicle is
    to keep the computer from scraping the ground. As computer systems become more
    integral to vehicles, performing security reviews becomes more important and complex.

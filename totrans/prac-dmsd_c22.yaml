- en: The first service worth mentioning is *citizens band (CB)* radio, an ancient
    but well-known band available to the general public. In the United States, transmitting
    here doesn’t require an explicit license, outside of the manufacturer’s certification
    for the transceiver itself. Operators are limited to 4 W, with no repeaters allowed.
    CB uses 40 designated channels centered around 27 MHz; astute readers will note
    that this is well below the common frequencies used by handheld radios today.
    The low frequency theoretically offers better propagation, but also means that
    most CB handhelds with small antennas won’t be transmitting efficiently. The technology
    is much better suited for vehicles and homes, and the handhelds are just a poorly
    performing afterthought.

  zh: 第一个值得提到的服务是*公民频段（CB）*无线电，这是一个古老但为大众所熟知的频段。在美国，在这里进行发射不需要明确的许可证，除了发射机本身的制造商认证之外。操作员的功率限制为4W，且不允许使用中继器。CB无线电使用40个指定频道，中心频率为27
    MHz；敏锐的读者会注意到，这个频率远低于今天手持无线电通常使用的频率。低频理论上提供了更好的传播能力，但也意味着大多数小天线的CB手持设备无法高效发射。这项技术更适合用于车辆和家庭，而手持设备只是一个表现不佳的附加设计。

    except for some long-haul truckers, who use it as a sort of roadside chat room.
    A distinctive culture surrounds CB, with its own lingo and a set of recurring
    conversation topics. If you call for help on these frequencies near a major road,
    you’ll probably get help; but beyond that, it’s not an environment to everybody’s
    liking and probably not a service to embrace.

    Service (FRS)*. The equipment operates on a set of 22 designated channels between
    462 and 467 MHz, with a power limit of 2 W. Many of the cheapest “blister pack”
    walkie-talkies are FRS. There are no bells and whistles: you won’t find any repeaters,
    the radios don’t support digital communications, and there’s no FRS community
    to speak of. The frequencies are typically quiet in most parts of the country,

    under the Christmas tree (an increasingly uncommon gift). FRS can be a good choice

    packet networks and keyboard-to-keyboard comms. The frequencies used by ham operators

- en: 'But today, betting on digital amateur radio is still risky. In addition to
    old-school amateurs being largely a recalcitrant bunch, a bit of a “system war”
    is going on: the three completely incompatible contenders are D-STAR, backed by
    Kenwood and Icom; System Fusion, backed by Yaesu; and Digital Mobile Radio (DMR),
    an offshoot of technologies developed for commercial use. It’s difficult to say
    who is winning. For example, there are plenty of Fusion-capable repeaters, but
    this is largely because the manufacturer is handing them out on the cheap to local
    clubs; the actual use of the system seems far lower than the repeater counts imply.
    Taking this into consideration, D-STAR and DMR are probably in the lead when it
    comes to organic use, and DMR is growing more rapidly, in part owing to the availability
    of sub-$100 radios from China. But the winner is still far from clear. If you

    The messages can range from automated GPS beacons, to weather station reports,

    APRS infrastructure that automatically rebroadcasts and routes messages, possibly
    reaching destinations hundreds of miles away. In effect, APRS is an example of
    a decentralized mesh network that actually works today. Few radios support stand-alone
    APRS messaging between handhelds, but many can be tethered to a laptop or a phone,

    to find. Its sign was even bigger and fancier than Tinker’s.

    Tinker back in Symbol owes me an algorithm, and he said I should talk to you about
    it.”

- en: Rustic was a tall, loud, messy-looking man with a big red beard. He didn’t look
    anything like the elegant Eponymous or the neat and proper Tinker.

    had recommended him, so Laurie handed him the IOU.

    miss. Improbable we can do right away. Impossible, by Tuesday at the latest.”

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “If it’s *improbable*, how do you do it?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “By shifting your point of view,” said Rustic. “Instead of looking for an answer
    that fits your problem, you imagine an *answer* and look for a problem to fit
    it.”

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    you really want is an answer, right?”

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Let’s say you’re at the market. You want the best, most perfect tomato. But
    to find the *best* tomato, you’d have to compare them all, right? You’d look at
    each and every one, turn it around, maybe squeeze it a bit. For every tomato in
    the whole market.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “No one does that!” said Laurie. “Well, old Mrs. Harris *does* do that. But
    my mom says she’s a little batty. I just pick a good one.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “See? You already know how to do things the Hugh Rustic way. You don’t waste
    your time looking for the *best* tomato when there are plenty that are Good Enough.”

- en: “So instead of trying to find the *shortest* path through all of the towns in
    Userland,” Laurie said, “we look for one that’s short *enough*?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Why not?” asked Rustic. “Out of all the zippity-million paths, I bet there
    are a whole lot that are pretty short. You need to find only *one* of them, and
    that’s much easier.”

- en: “Here is where we are,” he said, pointing to Permute, “and this is where you
    started, am I right? Let’s put some pencils here to stand in for Mount Upper Bound,
    and a little spoon there for Lower Bound Valley.” The map also had markers for
    Bach and Recursion Junction, as well as many other places Laurie hadn’t been to
    yet.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Ask the *ants*? What are you talking about? Ants can’t read maps!” Laurie said.
    At the mention of insects, Xor was suddenly alert.

- en: “Who says they can’t? Next you’ll try to tell me that turtles can’t draw circles,”
    Rustic said.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “So you teach the ants to read maps?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Not exactly. Ants are good at finding their way home already. The idea is to
    get them to work for us.” He opened a jar of honey and put a tiny daub of the
    sweet stuff on each town.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A minute passed. Nothing happened. Then a little ant crawled onto the table.
    It smelled the honey and zig-zagged its way onto the map. It nibbled from one
    bit of honey, then wandered around until it walked into another one.

- en: “When an ant finds food, she leaves a little scent message for the others that
    come after her,” Rustic said. “Ants follow the scent of food and also the scent
    of other ants. Lots of ants can try lots of different paths at the same time.
    Eventually they’ll settle on a quick route to all of the food and back to their
    nest.”

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first ant continued on to Bach. Another appeared and went directly to Recursion
    Junction instead. Still others went all the way across to Probability Bay, Permute,
    Notation, and other towns. Soon the map had dozens of ants going every which way,
    collecting bits of honey and leaving scents for their sisters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After a few minutes it was clear that some paths were more popular than others.
    The lines of ants got wider and wider, until there was just one ant superhighway
    that marched all around the map and back to the nest. Hugh Rustic copied it to
    a piece of paper before the honey disappeared.

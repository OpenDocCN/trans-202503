    shinobi should use cover to go undetected. They may wait for circumstances in
    which cover exists or, if necessary, create those circumstances themselves. The
    scrolls provide a wide range of situations that can aid infiltration, from natural
    occurrences (strong winds and rain) to social gatherings (festivals, weddings,
    and religious services) to shinobi-initiated activity (releasing horses, causing
    fights, and setting fire to buildings).^([1](b01.xhtml#endnote-145)) Regardless
    of their source, a canny shinobi should be able to capitalize on distractions,
    excitement, confusion, and other conditions that divert the target’s focus.

    For instance, heavy rainstorms meant empty streets, poor visibility, and torrents
    to muffle any sounds the shinobi made.^([2](b01.xhtml#endnote-146)) Of course,
    bad weather is bad for everyone, and the second poem of the *Yoshimori Hyakushu*
    notes that too strong a storm can overpower a shinobi, making it difficult to
    execute tactics and techniques: “In the dead of night, when the wind and rain
    are raging, the streets are so dark that shinobi cannot deliver a night attack
    easily.”^([3](b01.xhtml#endnote-147))'

- en: Shinobi also capitalized on other, more personal circumstances, such as a tragic
    death in the target’s family. The scrolls point out that while a target is in
    mourning, they may not sleep well for two or three nights, meaning the shinobi
    may approach unnoticed during the funeral or bereavement disguised as a mourner,
    or wait to infiltrate until the target finally sleeps deeply on night three or
    four.^([4](b01.xhtml#endnote-148))

    cases, shinobi took it upon themselves to cause severe illness at the target fortification.
    Sick people were ineffective defenders, and their worried caregivers were preoccupied
    and denied themselves sleep to tend to the ill. When the afflicted began to recover,
    the relieved caregivers slept heavily, at which point shinobi infiltrated. Alternatively,
    shinobi could destroy critical infrastructure, such as a bridge, and then wait
    for the target to undertake the large and difficult reconstruction project in
    the summer heat before infiltrating an exhausted opponent.^([5](b01.xhtml#endnote-149))

- en: Effective distractions could also be more directly confrontational. *Bansenshūkai*
    describes a technique called *kyonin* (“creating a gap by surprise”) that employs
    the assistance of military forces or other shinobi. These allies make the target
    think an attack is underway, perhaps by firing shots, beating war drums, or shouting,
    and the shinobi can slip in during the confusion. When the shinobi wanted to exit
    safely, this technique was simply repeated.^([6](b01.xhtml#endnote-150))

    as described in the shinobi scrolls apply to the digital era. The use of situational
    factors depends on defenders, security systems, and organizations having finite
    amounts of attention. Overloading, confusing, and misdirecting that limited attention
    creates opportunities a threat actor can exploit. We will identify various opportunities
    that can be found in modern networked environments and explain how they parallel
    the circumstances described in the shinobi scrolls. Finally, we will review how
    organizations can incorporate safeguards and resiliency to prepare for circumstances
    that may weaken their defenses.

- en: Cybersecurity adversaries may distract their targets and create conditions that
    make detecting infiltration as widely—and wisely—as shinobi once did. For example,
    when cyberdefenders detect a sudden distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack,
    standard operating procedures require evaluating the strength and duration of
    the DDoS and creating a security incident ticket to log the activity. Defenders
    may not immediately suspect a DDoS as cover for a threat actor’s attack on the
    network. So when the attack overwhelms the target’s security sensors and packet
    capture (pcap) and intrusion detection or prevention systems (IDS/IPS) fail to
    open—in other words, when there is too much communication to inspect—defensive
    systems might naturally rush the packet along without searching it for malicious
    content. When the DDoS ceases, the defenders will note that there was no significant
    downtime and return their status to normal, not realizing that, while the DDoS
    lasted only 10 minutes, the packet flood gave the adversary enough time and cover
    to compromise the system and establish a foothold in the network. (As in *Yoshimori
    Hyakushu* 2*,* which warned that a strong storm could hinder both target and attacker*,*
    the adversary is unlikely to deploy an overly intense DDoS. Doing so could cause
    networking gear to drop packets and lose communication data—including their own
    attacks. Instead, an attacker will likely throttle target systems to overwhelm
    security without disrupting communication.)

- en: Adversaries have many other ways to create favorable circumstances in the infiltration
    target; they are limited only by their ingenuity. It could be advantageous to
    attack service and infrastructure quality and reliability, such as by disrupting
    ISPs or interconnections. Patient attackers could wait for commercial vendors
    to release faulty updates or patches, after which the target’s security or IT
    staff temporarily creates “permit any-any” conditions or removes security controls
    to troubleshoot the problem. Threat actors might monitor a company’s asset acquisition
    process to determine when it moves new systems and servers to production or the
    cloud—and, hence, when these targets might be temporarily unguarded or not properly
    configured against attacks. Threat actors might also track a corporate merger
    and attempt to infiltrate gaps created when the different companies combine networks.
    Other adversaries might use special events hosted in the target’s building, such
    as large conferences, vendor expos, and third-party meetings, to mingle in the
    crowd of strangers and infiltrate the target. They might even pick up a swag bag
    in the process.

    and it should be considered even harder to guarantee 100 percent assurance of
    security at all times for those same digital systems. Furthermore, it is almost
    certainly impossible to prevent disasters, hazards, accidents, failures and unforeseen
    changes—many of which will create circumstances in which opportunistic threat
    actors can infiltrate. Being overly cautious to avoid these circumstances can
    hamper a business’s ability to be bold in strategy and execute on goals. A solution
    to this dilemma may be to redundantly layer systems to reduce infiltration opportunities.
    Security teams might put in place the equivalent of high-availability security—security
    that is layered redundantly where systems are weaker. *Practice awareness and
    preparation.* As part of security staff protocols for change management, events,
    incidents, crises, natural disasters, and other distracting or confusing circumstances,
    train your security team to look for indications that an event was created or
    is being used by adversaries to infiltrate the organization. Document role responsibilities
    in organizational policies and procedures. Use threat modeling, tabletop exercises,
    and risk management to identify potential distractions, then consider safeguards,
    countermeasures, and protections for handling them.

    explored how this tactic could play out in modern networked environments. We covered

    so novel or secret that no one has yet thought about how to defend against it.
    Shinobi had exploits and techniques similar to zero-days; they were so secret,
    it was forbidden to write them down, and the scrolls only allude to them indirectly.
    We are left only with cryptic clues—clues provided to remind a shinobi of a secret
    technique they had learned, but not to teach it. Even so, the scrolls provide
    insight around how to create new zero-days, procedures to defend against them,
    and tradecraft in executing them. Furthermore, the scrolls describe several historical
    zero-day techniques that had been lost due to their disclosure, giving us insight
    into modern zero-day exploits and a potential forecast of zero-days of the future.

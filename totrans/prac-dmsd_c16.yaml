    in our bodies comes not from biological sources, but from the industrial Haber-Bosch
    process, which combines atmospheric gases with hydrogen to produce ammonia; the

    the element can’t be absorbed from air by plants or animals, the Haber-Bosch process
    can be seen as one of humanity’s greatest triumphs: it removed a fundamental agricultural
    bottleneck and allowed us to significantly expand food production while making
    efficient use of arable land. Yet, to some prognosticators, Haber-Bosch is a sign
    that we strayed from the path. They juxtapose the simple beauty of subsistence
    farming with the complexity—and by implication, the fragility—of chemical engineering
    and modern-day food supply chains. Their prediction is simple: one day, big agriculture
    is bound to fall apart, and our society will crumble with it.'

    food is cheaper, more abundant, and available more dependably than ever before.
    If a new potato blight wipes out the crops in Idaho, America can eat more corn
    or pay five cents extra for taters grown in another part of the world. Compared
    to some other industries, farming and the associated transportation infrastructure
    have relatively few choke points too. In the developed world, as long as the oil

    a fully stocked fridge.

    kcal per pound, or from sugar and protein (both around 1,800 kcal/lb). Logistics
    and comfort are more important than nutritional details, and so is the ability
    to pace yourself. It follows that familiar flavors and simple, satiating meals

    per day; on the flip side, fruit- or vegetable-heavy regimens may fall quite a

- en: There are two basic schools of building a food stockpile. One proposes the creation
    of a *segregated cache* of extremely shelf-stable goods, such as canned fruit
    or meat—and then leaving it undisturbed for years, until it’s time to replace
    the entire stash. Another approach is to build a *first-in, first-out buffer*
    in the pantry, keeping an excess of everyday goods and consuming the ones that
    approach the expiration date, then buying more to replenish the cache.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The buffer approach has its charm. For one, it creates no waste and ensures
    freshness throughout the stash. But it has downsides too. For folks who don’t
    cook often, or who get most of their calories or flavor from perishables, the
    method simply doesn’t scale. A stockpile created this way also isn’t necessarily
    conducive to conserving cooking water or fuel, or to optimizing storage space.
    Last but not least, the approach may not play well with evacuation scenarios down
    the line; for example, a bag of raw potatoes grabbed from the pantry is a poor
    snack on the road.
  prefs: []

    may be more versatile. It allows for a varied diet optimized for ease of preparation,
    cost, or any other attributes that make sense in the context of your plans. The
    occasional waste of food is regrettable but ultimately inconsequential: a well-designed
    stockpile needs to be rotated only once in a blue moon. The negative impact can
    be minimized by donating nonperishables approaching their expiration date to local
    food banks; many food banks will also gladly take expired cans.'

    most significant danger of eating, say, a box of crackers past their “best by”
    date is the possibility of choking on a poorly chewed piece. Sloppy home canning
    is sometimes implicated in deadly botulism cases, but the condition is far less

    produce keeps for a decade or more.^([6](b02.xhtml#c16-endnote-6)) Similarly,
    almost all dry staples—from rice to powdered milk—can be stored for years when
    oxygen and moisture are properly excluded from the packaging. An exception needs

    unlike regular plastic, the material is largely impermeable to gas. The bags are
    available cheaply online and can be sealed with an inexpensive tool called an
    *impulse sealer*—or in a pinch, with an ordinary clothes iron set to Cotton (about
    400°F). It’s also good to throw an oxygen absorber pouch into the bag to scavenge
    the air trapped inside.

    as possible. The rate of many undesirable chemical reactions roughly doubles with
    every 20°F, so any supplies stored in the attic or in a hot car will need to be
    rotated much more frequently than if kept at 70°F year-round. For foods stored
    in basements, backyard sheds, or other potentially damp environments, moisture
    is also a concern. In such a case, even ingredients that are notionally unaffected
    by oxygen, such as table sugar, should be bagged to prevent clumping or mold.
    In fact, care should be exercised even with canned goods. Although moisture has
    no direct effect on the contents, cans stored in damp environments can rust through
    and lose seal.

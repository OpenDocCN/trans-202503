    The most common constrained mode is horizontal or vertical dragging with Ctrl

    two invisible "rails," one horizontal and one vertical, which intersect at the
    point where the dragging started. The selection can then move only along those
    rails, jumping from one to the other depending on which is closer.

    drag these selected objects around, you may run into another problem: any drag
    starts with a click, and that click may easily ruin your carefully constructed
    selection by selecting something else, such as the object that happens be on top

    selection to be dragged without inadvertently selecting other objects. You can

    itself but from an empty canvas or any other object.

    change selection by "selecting under." Unlike regular click-to-select, however,
    "selecting under" happens not when you click your mouse button but when you *release*
    it after a click. If, between click and release, you didn't move your mouse by
    more than the click/drag threshold ([5.4](c05.xhtml#section5.4), the default is

    is not the same as zooming; when you zoom, you just view your drawing from closer

    the corners and four on the sides of the selection's bounding box, as shown in

    (horizontally or vertically); dragging the corner handles scales it in both directions.

    objects may *not* be preserved. You can stretch or squeeze your selection, or

    scaling proportional for both corner and side handles. Another way to achieve

    so that it is scaled symmetrically out from the center. This is what Shift does.

    it is an undoable action, and fixed points of all objects are saved with the document.
    Scaling, rotating, and skewing are performed around this point not only with the
    Selector tool but with most other methods as well (such as in theTransform dialog
    or when transforming by keyboard shortcuts).

    an object. With the Selector tool, you can freely drag it to any location (inside
    or outside the object itself). When dragged, the fixed point snaps to the edges
    of the object's bounding box, to the geometric center (its original location),
    and to the horizontal and vertical axes going through the geometric center. This
    makes it easy to snap the fixed point back into the original position or to a
    corner of the bounding box. Drag it with Shift to suppress snapping; drag it with
    Ctrl to limit its movement to horizontal/vertical axes.
  prefs: []

    can only drag it with the mouse.

    with Shift-clicks) or the one that is the *topmost* in the z-order (if you've

    → or Shift-→ keystrokes. When finished, I will select it again and move it back
    into place with the exact same number of movement keystrokes in the opposite direction.
    (Do not use Alt-arrows in this case because you may be at a different zoom level

    of selected objects. As a result, each interval between adjacent objects will
    increase by 5 px, and the whole row will be spaced out, much like how a letterspacing
    adjustment spaces out a text string ([15.4.5](c15.xhtml#section15.4.5)). Moving
    these objects by –5 px will, conversely, squeeze them tighter together, the leftmost
    one moving by 5 px to the left, the next one by 10 px, and so on. For vertical
    moves, the effect is the same except that it starts from the object closest to
    the top (that is, the object with the smallest Y coordinate).

    The units drop-down menu also contains all the absolute units you may need (switching

    selection in the chosen unit). The Scale proportionally checkbox is analogous
    to the lock button on the Selector's controls bar.

    W and H controls. However, the Apply to each object separately checkbox is unique
    to this dialog. It applies the same scaling to each selected object, scaling it
    around its own fixed point ([6.4](#section6.4)) instead of scaling the selection
    as a whole around its center. For the % unit, this means scaling each selected
    object by the same ratio; for all other units, this results in all selected objects
    getting the same specified width and height.

    "soft brush" metaphor not only to transforming objects but also to styling them
    ([8.9](c08.xhtml#section8.9)) and to path editing ([12.6](c12.xhtml#section12.6)).
    This tool has a number of *modes*; in this chapter, I describe those modes that
    deal with transforming, duplicating, and deleting objects. Using these modes,
    you can *draw by scattering*—sweep, sway, or sculpt fields of objects, such as
    Spray tool effusions ([4.7](c04.xhtml#section4.7)) or clone tilings ([16.6](c16.xhtml#section16.6)),
    into complex and naturalistic images.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All modes of the Tweak tool share a number of common features. In all of them,
    you use a circular soft-edged brush (the orange circle you see under the cursor)
    controlled by the Width and Force parameters on the controls bar and optionally
    affected by the pen pressure (if you have a pressure-sensitive tablet). You "paint"
    with this brush over the selected objects to act on them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The *width* of the brush varies from 1 to 100, but these aren't absolute units;
    at any zoom, 1 gives you a very small brush and 100 gives you a brush approximately
    the size of your screen. The tool shows the current brush width as a circular
    brush outline centered on your mouse cursor. To change the width, use the **Width**
    control on the toolbar or the ← (narrower) and → (wider) keys. The brush is soft;
    its action peaks in the center and smoothly decreases toward the edge following
    a bell-like profile.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly, *force* ranges from 1 (very weak—you need to stroke an object several
    times to get a visible effect) to 100 (very strong—the first stroke of the brush
    applies the maximum effect). To change the force, use the toolbar control or press
    the ↓ (weaker) and ↑ (stronger) keys.

    away the copies. Now, select all the objects you created, switch to the Tweak
    tool, adjust the **Width** so the circle covers several objects at once, set **Force**
    to a moderate value of 20, enable one of the modes (described below), and start

    or deleted, as always, depends on force and pen pressure. This completes the "scatter
    drawing" toolset by providing a way to thicken or thin out your scattering wherever
    necessary.

- en: As with the regular Duplicate command ([4.5](c04.xhtml#section4.5)), duplicating
    with the Tweak tool places the copies right over the originals, so it is a good
    idea to use the Jitter mode after duplicating to ruffle them apart. The duplicates
    created by the tool are automatically added to selection if the original objects
    were selected.

- en: Now that you can transform your objects using all kinds of methods, let's look
    at what exactly gets transformed when you do it. As it turns out, Inkscape can
    optionally transform or not transform some specific parts or aspects of objects.
    This is controlled by the four toggle buttons on the right end of the Selector
    controls bar, as shown in [Figure 6-24](#fig6-24).

- en: Stroke width
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This option applies only to scaling and has no effect on moving, rotating, or
    skewing. When it's on, any scaled object that has stroke ([8.2](c08.xhtml#section8.2))
    will have the width of the stroke scaled by the same ratio. For example, if you
    scale an object with a 2-px-wide stroke to twice its current size and this button
    is on, the resulting object will have 4-px-wide stroke. If the button is off,
    it will have the same unchanged stroke width of 2 px.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you scale an object without preserving the aspect ratio, if this button
    is on, stroke gets scaled by the square root of the product of vertical and horizontal
    scale ratios. (I know!) A slightly simpler way to put it is that the stroke scale
    ratio will be the*geometric mean* of the horizontal and vertical ratios. For example,
    if you scale an object to twice its width horizontally but leave its height unchanged,
    the stroke becomes wider by a factor of 1.415 (the square root of 2).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keeping stroke width unscaled is more commonly useful. For example, in a plan
    or draft, you normally want all your objects to have the same fixed stroke width,
    unaffected by scaling, so you would toggle this button off. It only makes sense
    to turn this on when you're using stroke as a purely visual element (such as brush-like
    strokes in a freehand drawing).

- en: Rounded rectangle corners
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This option also applies only to scaling and has no effect on moving, rotating,
    or skewing. It controls whether Inkscape scales the rounded corners of rectangles
    ([11.2.2](c11.xhtml#section11.2.2)). When it's on, a rectangle is scaled as a
    whole, just as it would be scaled if converted to path; this may lead to the rounded
    corner becoming larger, smaller, and/or nonround. When it's off, Inkscape preserves
    the rounded corners exactly as they were. Turning this off can be useful, for
    example, in a flowchart diagram where you want all your boxes to have the same
    rounded corners regardless of their sizes.

- en: Gradients
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This button controls whether transformations are applied to the gradients in
    objects' fills or strokes ([10.1](c10.xhtml#section10.1)). Since gradients (more
    precisely, positions of gradient stops) can be moved, rotated, and skewed as well
    as scaled, this button applies to any kind of transformations. When it's on, the
    gradient stops are transformed as a whole with the object carrying the gradient.
    When it's off, the gradient stays glued to the canvas (unchanged in position,
    direction, or scale) while the object is transformed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, with this button toggled off, it is possible to move an object*out*
    of its own gradient or scale it up so that more of the gradient becomes visible.
    This is useful when the gradient's position is coordinated with other objects
    in your drawing whereas the object itself is simply a "window" onto that gradient,
    and you want to move or adjust the edges of that window without touching the gradient
    itself.

    patterns ([10.8](c10.xhtml#section10.8)) instead of gradients.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With a path, another way to "transform" it without affecting stroke width, gradients,
    or patterns (regardless of these Selector options) is by selecting all of its
    nodes in the Node tool and transforming the node selection ([12.5.7.3](c12.xhtml#section12.5.7.3)).

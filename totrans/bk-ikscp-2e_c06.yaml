    The most common constrained mode is horizontal or vertical dragging with Ctrl
    ([Figure 6-1](#fig6-1)). If you press and hold Ctrl while dragging, Inkscape creates
    two invisible "rails," one horizontal and one vertical, which intersect at the
    point where the dragging started. The selection can then move only along those
    rails, jumping from one to the other depending on which is closer.

    selection to be dragged without inadvertently selecting other objects. You can

    itself but from an empty canvas or any other object.

    it after a click. If, between click and release, you didn't move your mouse by
    more than the click/drag threshold ([5.4](c05.xhtml#section5.4), the default is

- en: By default, the fixed point is in the geometric center of the bounding box of
    an object. With the Selector tool, you can freely drag it to any location (inside
    or outside the object itself). When dragged, the fixed point snaps to the edges
    of the object's bounding box, to the geometric center (its original location),
    and to the horizontal and vertical axes going through the geometric center. This
    makes it easy to snap the fixed point back into the original position or to a
    corner of the bounding box. Drag it with Shift to suppress snapping; drag it with
    Ctrl to limit its movement to horizontal/vertical axes.

- en: If, with multiple objects selected, you drag the selection's fixed point, it
    applies to *all* selected objects—each of them will have this new fixed point
    position. For example, if you draw a wheel with multiple spokes, you can select
    all the spokes and move the fixed point to the center of the wheel just once.
    After that, even if you select a single spoke, it will conveniently rotate around

- en: Also, the fixed point is inherited when you duplicate or clone ([16.1](c16.xhtml#section16.1))
    an object. For example, you can draw a single spoke, move its fixed point to the
    center of the wheel, then go on duplicating (or cloning) that spoke and simply

    the absolute coordinates of the selection, in the Move tab, you can view and specify
    either absolute coordinates or relative displacements. By default, the Relative
    move checkbox is on, so the Horizontal and Vertical fields display zeros, and
    any numbers you type there will move selection*by* that much (for example, the
    values of `**3**` and `**0**` move the selection by 3 units horizontally to the
    right).

    and Relative move checkboxes are turned on, each object will be shifted, not relative
    to its own previous position, but relative to its neighbor—the nearest selected
    object to the left (for X) or below (for Y). This makes it possible to "space
    out" or "tighten up" collections of objects.
  id: totrans-101
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if you need to space out a horizontal row of objects, select them
    and move them horizontally by 5 px with both checkboxes checked. The leftmost
    object will shift by 5 px to the right, the next one by 10 px, and so on until
    the rightmost selected object is displaced by 5*n* px where *n* is the number
    of selected objects. As a result, each interval between adjacent objects will
    increase by 5 px, and the whole row will be spaced out, much like how a letterspacing
    adjustment spaces out a text string ([15.4.5](c15.xhtml#section15.4.5)). Moving
    these objects by –5 px will, conversely, squeeze them tighter together, the leftmost
    one moving by 5 px to the left, the next one by 10 px, and so on. For vertical
    moves, the effect is the same except that it starts from the object closest to
    the top (that is, the object with the smallest Y coordinate).

    W and H controls. However, the Apply to each object separately checkbox is unique
    to this dialog. It applies the same scaling to each selected object, scaling it
    around its own fixed point ([6.4](#section6.4)) instead of scaling the selection
    as a whole around its center. For the % unit, this means scaling each selected
    object by the same ratio; for all other units, this results in all selected objects
    getting the same specified width and height.

    however, they are definitely more real than Measure tool's machinery because they
    are visible in any tool (though you can hide them) and are saved/restored with
    the document. When you press the To guides button on the controls bar, the current
    measurement generates a bunch of guides—one for the measurement line itself, two
    horizontal/vertical crosses for its start/end points, and one slanted for each
    of the intersections, as shown in [Figure 6-20](#fig6-20).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Tweak tool (W or Shift-F2) is a versatile instrument that applies the same
    "soft brush" metaphor not only to transforming objects but also to styling them
    ([8.9](c08.xhtml#section8.9)) and to path editing ([12.6](c12.xhtml#section12.6)).
    This tool has a number of *modes*; in this chapter, I describe those modes that
    deal with transforming, duplicating, and deleting objects. Using these modes,
    you can *draw by scattering*—sweep, sway, or sculpt fields of objects, such as
    Spray tool effusions ([4.7](c04.xhtml#section4.7)) or clone tilings ([16.6](c16.xhtml#section16.6)),
    into complex and naturalistic images.
  id: totrans-188
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All modes of the Tweak tool share a number of common features. In all of them,
    you use a circular soft-edged brush (the orange circle you see under the cursor)
    controlled by the Width and Force parameters on the controls bar and optionally
    affected by the pen pressure (if you have a pressure-sensitive tablet). You "paint"
    with this brush over the selected objects to act on them.
  id: totrans-189
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The *width* of the brush varies from 1 to 100, but these aren't absolute units;
    at any zoom, 1 gives you a very small brush and 100 gives you a brush approximately
    the size of your screen. The tool shows the current brush width as a circular
    brush outline centered on your mouse cursor. To change the width, use the **Width**
    control on the toolbar or the ← (narrower) and → (wider) keys. The brush is soft;
    its action peaks in the center and smoothly decreases toward the edge following
    a bell-like profile.
  id: totrans-190
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similarly, *force* ranges from 1 (very weak—you need to stroke an object several
    times to get a visible effect) to 100 (very strong—the first stroke of the brush
    applies the maximum effect). To change the force, use the toolbar control or press
    the ↓ (weaker) and ↑ (stronger) keys.
  id: totrans-191
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To get a feeling of how the Tweak tool works, create a number of small objects
    in a test drawing—for example, with the Spray tool ([4.7](c04.xhtml#section4.7))
    or just by manually duplicating (Ctrl-D) or cloning (Alt-D) an object and dragging
    away the copies. Now, select all the objects you created, switch to the Tweak
    tool, adjust the **Width** so the circle covers several objects at once, set **Force**
    to a moderate value of 20, enable one of the modes (described below), and start
    dragging over the objects. [Figure 6-23](#fig6-23) shows what will happen.

    at what exactly gets transformed when you do it. As it turns out, Inkscape can
    optionally transform or not transform some specific parts or aspects of objects.
    This is controlled by the four toggle buttons on the right end of the Selector
    controls bar, as shown in [Figure 6-24](#fig6-24).

- en: This option applies only to scaling and has no effect on moving, rotating, or
    skewing. When it's on, any scaled object that has stroke ([8.2](c08.xhtml#section8.2))
    will have the width of the stroke scaled by the same ratio. For example, if you
    scale an object with a 2-px-wide stroke to twice its current size and this button
    is on, the resulting object will have 4-px-wide stroke. If the button is off,
    it will have the same unchanged stroke width of 2 px.
  id: totrans-213
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you scale an object without preserving the aspect ratio, if this button
    is on, stroke gets scaled by the square root of the product of vertical and horizontal
    scale ratios. (I know!) A slightly simpler way to put it is that the stroke scale
    ratio will be the*geometric mean* of the horizontal and vertical ratios. For example,
    if you scale an object to twice its width horizontally but leave its height unchanged,
    the stroke becomes wider by a factor of 1.415 (the square root of 2).
  id: totrans-214
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keeping stroke width unscaled is more commonly useful. For example, in a plan
    or draft, you normally want all your objects to have the same fixed stroke width,
    unaffected by scaling, so you would toggle this button off. It only makes sense
    to turn this on when you're using stroke as a purely visual element (such as brush-like
    strokes in a freehand drawing).

    ([11.2.2](c11.xhtml#section11.2.2)). When it's on, a rectangle is scaled as a
    whole, just as it would be scaled if converted to path; this may lead to the rounded
    corner becoming larger, smaller, and/or nonround. When it's off, Inkscape preserves
    the rounded corners exactly as they were. Turning this off can be useful, for
    example, in a flowchart diagram where you want all your boxes to have the same
    rounded corners regardless of their sizes.

    precisely, positions of gradient stops) can be moved, rotated, and skewed as well
    as scaled, this button applies to any kind of transformations. When it's on, the
    gradient stops are transformed as a whole with the object carrying the gradient.
    When it's off, the gradient stays glued to the canvas (unchanged in position,
    direction, or scale) while the object is transformed.
  id: totrans-219
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, with this button toggled off, it is possible to move an object*out*
    of its own gradient or scale it up so that more of the gradient becomes visible.
    This is useful when the gradient's position is coordinated with other objects
    in your drawing whereas the object itself is simply a "window" onto that gradient,
    and you want to move or adjust the edges of that window without touching the gradient
    itself.

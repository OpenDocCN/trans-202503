- en: The shinobi scrolls are filled with details about how to bypass a target’s security
    personnel. To a shinobi in the field, no defensive impediment is quite as pressing—or
    as complicated—as an enemy’s guards. While the scrolls instruct shinobi to work
    in blind spots that guards cannot monitor or protect easily, the most exploitable
    gaps stem not from poor military strategy or lack of manpower but from guards’
    negligence and lack of discipline.

    bearings, and actions to infer more about their discipline. For instance, if the
    moat and surrounding perimeter of a castle are kept clean, clear, and well lit,
    then the guards are likely vigilant and practice defensive hygiene. But if commonly
    known castle entry points such as corners, spillways, and sewage outlets are not
    protected, it could be a sign that the guards or their commanders neglect their
    duties.^([2](b01.xhtml#endnote-179))

    discipline, behavior, and capability in their own defenses. Again, the scrolls
    cite guards’ negligence and laziness as the biggest obstacles to a successful
    defense, and they put the onus for overcoming those vices on lords or commanders,
    whose strict discipline, tough training, and thorough attention to detail could
    give their guards the requisite mental toughness to defend against enemy threats,
    including other shinobi.^([3](b01.xhtml#endnote-180)) “Every single thing is decided
    by your own mind and by the way that you think,” say the ninja poems. “If you

    operations centers (SOCs) of today. We will touch on the modernization of security,
    which has shifted security responsibility to all employees instead of just security
    personnel. We’ll review methods by which an external threat actor can detect poor
    security controls/practices on networks. In addition, we’ll present some theory
    around the direct interaction between security staff and adversaries—particularly
    if the adversary can infiltrate SOC/IR ticket systems—as well as other ideas about
    how adversaries may be able to judge the vigilance of the SOC. Most importantly,
    we discuss why security staff behavior is so important, why it may degrade over
    time, and how to establish a culture of security excellence.

    looking over their shoulder, many workers simply shirk their duties. Lazy cybersecurity
    professionals have ample cover. Their tasks are largely invisible to their colleagues—even
    their supervisors. Many operation centers are isolated behind locked doors where
    employees work, relax, or even sleep without anyone knowing the difference. Their
    networks and machines exist on separate VLANs or “research” boxes that allow them
    to freely browse the internet without logging, inspection, or filtering.'

- en: The industry’s heavy reliance on process can also lull employees into a state
    of negligence or complacency. Through procedural repetition, security staff develop
    familiarities, habits, and narrowed ideas of what it means to defend their organization.
    While this tendency stems from the necessary routines of everyday work, it also
    results in highly specialized single-tool or single-approach defenders who don’t
    consider attackers’ techniques and tools outside the scope of their own daily
    experience. Such a limited mindset leaves an organization with considerable security
    gaps.

    field that demands deep specialized knowledge, ability, and ambition raises the
    risk of burnout. After tiresome months spent hunting for threats and incidents,
    it becomes easy to lose focus, rely on known concepts, wait to act until there
    is a security systems or software alert, or learn only what is necessary to report
    or remediate specific security incidents as they appear.

- en: Cyber professionals aren’t the sole arbiters of computer literacy and security
    awareness; all employees share this responsibility. Unfortunately, this means
    the laziness and negligence of nontechnical employees is often a bigger security
    threat to an organization than a malicious external actor. These employees may
    inadvertently expose their company’s network or systems to threats by carelessly
    clicking on phishing emails or plugging in foreign USB drives they find in the
    parking lot. If management does not enforce security vigilance and discipline
    when appropriate, then conscientious employees are forced to operate in a culture
    in which careless employees abound and may even be rewarded. Success at these
    organizations becomes a game of attrition, wherein employees are promoted for
    surviving the longest without burning out or quitting. This environment compromises
    the work ethic, discipline, and integrity of the effective workers and degrades
    the entire workforce, allowing threat actors to exploit the many gaps these nonvigilant
    employees create.

    vigilance, just as poor leadership decisions or organizational strategies can
    weaken security posture and degrade employee trust. Attempts to improve defensive
    blind spots or weaknesses typically require interdepartmental cooperation, shared
    budgets, weekend hours, and inconveniences that lead employees to complain and
    resist the initiatives. As a result, worn down, defeated security engineers become
    cynical about security improvements and turn a blind eye to existing deficiencies.
    Some may even wait for an incident to occur, knowing their organization’s reactive
    security posture means they won’t be allowed to make improvements unless something
    bad happens first.

    reward staff who implement additional security, ongoing vigilance sends a message

    that interior defenses may be even stronger.

    culture at work, and conditioning over time from their learned experiences. Shaping
    work culture by reinforcing behavior selectively and implementing meaningful work-feedback
    loops will encourage employees toward excellence. The lack of feedback, especially
    of positive feedback, may be the most challenging issue to address in security,
    as it can be easy for a defender’s behavior to slide into a low-energy state of
    security nihilism. This can result from a lack of positive reinforcement for good
    behavior. Perhaps the only inputs received by the security staff are compliance
    audits and KPI numbers, which don’t represent the utility of their actions. The
    results of good performance, like stopping adversaries from robbing the organization
    of intellectual property or money, can take years to manifest and thus can be
    hard to build on. Listed below is guidance on how to improve and sustain good

    to assess infiltration opportunities based on their target’s security standards
    (or lack thereof). We reviewed how hundreds of years ago, as today, it was commonplace
    for guards to become complacent in their duties and how skilled infiltrators were
    able to take advantage of this complacency. In addition, we touched on the ways
    culture can shape an organization’s ability to defend itself; this concept was
    given paramount importance in the philosophy of shinobi. Shinobi culture was then
    compared to modern SOCs and InfoSec work cultures, which have issues that today’s
    cyber adversaries are likely to exploit. We also described several methods and

- en: The iPhone was announced in January of 2007 and released in June, six months
    later. The device relied on a touchscreen^([1](#c37-footnote-1)) for user interaction,
    and affected both consumers and the industry overall, changing what the world
    considered to be a smartphone and what Android needed to do to compete in the
    evolving smartphone marketplace.

    appeared in various places since: “As a consumer I was blown away. I wanted one
    immediately. But as a Google engineer, I thought ‘We’re going to have to start
    over.’”^([2](#c37-footnote-2))'

    its development plans.

    Rather, they needed to re-prioritize and change product schedules.

- en: When the iPhone was announced, the Android team was very much heads-down in
    development. The device they were working on was called Sooner, so named because
    they wanted it to come out sooner than the real target device for Android, the
    Dream (which was based on the HTC Dream hardware). Sooner had no touchscreen.
    Instead, it relied on a hardware keyboard for UI navigation, which was a common
    user experience on phones . . . before touchscreens became must-have features.

- en: The Dream device did have a touchscreen, and the Android platform was being
    designed to incorporate that capability. But Dream was slated to launch later
    while the team focused on shipping 1.0 with the Sooner device, well, sooner. Suddenly,
    touchscreen capability had to be prioritized and shifted from a future device
    to the first device. And that first device had to change accordingly.

- en: 'The Sooner was dropped, and development pivoted to the Dream device (which
    was eventually launched in the US as the T-Mobile G1). Brian Swetland remarked
    on the team’s pivot: “When the iPhone happened, the decision was: We’re going
    to skip shipping Sooner and we’re gonna ship Dream as soon as it’s ready. Because
    it didn’t make sense to ship a BlackBerry wedge after Steve^([3](#c37-footnote-3))
    shipped the iPhone.”'

    the platform. “If it would have shipped, there wouldn’t have been multiprocess.
    I was so stressed about that. I was glad that we dropped Sooner. The software
    schedule just didn’t line up with the hardware schedule.”

- en: Meanwhile, the team also built out the platform capabilities to support touchscreen
    functionality in 1.0\. Jason Parks said, “As soon as we flipped, Marco [Nelissen]
    got touch panels and hacked it up^([4](#c37-footnote-4)) and we had touch.”^([5](#c37-footnote-5))

- en: Swetland talked about the rumors that Android completely restarted development
    because of touch. “I feel like we should be honored that they believe we could
    completely reset and rebuild the entire world in three months, and not that we
    spent years ahead of time building up adaptive UI and the tooling that let us
    rejigger the world and had all this work done ahead of time.”

    “I was upset that we hadn’t shipped. I thought that we could’ve gotten out before
    the iPhone had we shipped the Sooner product.”

    announcement. A lot. *The Brady Bunch* is a classic American sitcom from the early
    1970s. In one episode, Jan is tired of her older sister, Marsha, getting all of
    the attention. At one point, Jan exclaims, “Marsha, Marsha, Marsha!” Soon after
    the iPhone announcement, while the Android building was buzzing with discussions
    about the new device, Andy sent an email to the team that read, “iPhone, iPhone,
    iPhone!”

    with more capabilities and a touchscreen-driven user interface. But carriers and
    manufacturers saw a potential monopoly being formed, one that would exclude them.

- en: 'The iPhone was going to have a single manufacturer: Apple. All of the device
    manufacturers not named “Apple” would be cut out of that market. Also, the iPhone
    would initially work with only a single carrier in each market (such as AT&T in
    the US), ensuring that no other carriers would benefit from iPhone users (and
    their precious data usage) on their network until that exclusive contract expired.
    Other manufacturers in the ecosystem, such as chip vendors, were also afraid of
    being excluded; if Apple didn’t happen to choose their chips for iPhone hardware,
    then they too would be left out.'

    only returning Google’s calls; they were approaching Google all on their own.
    They needed a comparable smartphone product, and Android offered a way to have
    one much sooner than they could have had otherwise.

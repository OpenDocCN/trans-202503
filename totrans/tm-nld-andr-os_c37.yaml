  zh: —Steve Jobs（iPhone宣布，2007年1月9日）
- en: The iPhone was announced in January of 2007 and released in June, six months
    later. The device relied on a touchscreen^([1](#c37-footnote-1)) for user interaction,
    and affected both consumers and the industry overall, changing what the world
    considered to be a smartphone and what Android needed to do to compete in the
    evolving smartphone marketplace.

  zh: iPhone于2007年1月宣布，并于6月发布，发布时相隔六个月。该设备依赖于触摸屏^([1](#c37-footnote-1))进行用户交互，深刻影响了消费者和整个行业，改变了世界对智能手机的定义，也影响了Android需要做什么才能在不断发展的智能手机市场中竞争。
- en: 'There was a quote from an engineer on the Android team at that time that has
    appeared in various places since: “As a consumer I was blown away. I wanted one
    immediately. But as a Google engineer, I thought ‘We’re going to have to start
    over.’”^([2](#c37-footnote-2))'

    its development plans.

  zh: 确实，Android的计划发生了变化，但团队并不需要重新开始。相反，他们需要重新优先排序并调整产品进度。
- en: When the iPhone was announced, the Android team was very much heads-down in
    development. The device they were working on was called Sooner, so named because
    they wanted it to come out sooner than the real target device for Android, the
    Dream (which was based on the HTC Dream hardware). Sooner had no touchscreen.
    Instead, it relied on a hardware keyboard for UI navigation, which was a common
    user experience on phones . . . before touchscreens became must-have features.

  zh: 当iPhone宣布时，Android团队正全力投入开发。他们正在开发的设备叫做Sooner，之所以这么命名，是因为他们希望它比Android的真正目标设备Dream（基于HTC
    Dream硬件）更早发布。Sooner没有触摸屏，而是依赖硬件键盘进行UI导航，这是在触摸屏成为必备功能之前，手机的常见用户体验……
- en: The Dream device did have a touchscreen, and the Android platform was being
    designed to incorporate that capability. But Dream was slated to launch later
    while the team focused on shipping 1.0 with the Sooner device, well, sooner. Suddenly,
    touchscreen capability had to be prioritized and shifted from a future device
    to the first device. And that first device had to change accordingly.

  zh: Dream设备确实配备了触摸屏，而Android平台正在设计中以支持这一功能。但Dream计划稍晚发布，而团队则专注于尽早推出1.0版和Sooner设备。突然间，触摸屏功能必须被优先考虑，并从未来设备转移到首个设备上。这个首个设备也因此需要相应改变。
- en: 'The Sooner was dropped, and development pivoted to the Dream device (which
    was eventually launched in the US as the T-Mobile G1). Brian Swetland remarked
    on the team’s pivot: “When the iPhone happened, the decision was: We’re going
    to skip shipping Sooner and we’re gonna ship Dream as soon as it’s ready. Because
    it didn’t make sense to ship a BlackBerry wedge after Steve^([3](#c37-footnote-3))
    shipped the iPhone.”'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: Sooner被放弃，开发重点转向了Dream设备（该设备最终作为T-Mobile G1在美国发布）。Brian Swetland谈到团队的转变时说：“当iPhone发布时，决定是：我们要跳过发布Sooner，尽快发布Dream，因为发布一款BlackBerry风格的设备，在Steve^([3](#c37-footnote-3))发布iPhone之后，根本没有意义。”
- en: Dianne Hackborn liked the change in plans and saw it as an opportunity to finish
    the platform. “If it would have shipped, there wouldn’t have been multiprocess.
    I was so stressed about that. I was glad that we dropped Sooner. The software
    schedule just didn’t line up with the hardware schedule.”

  zh: Dianne Hackborn 喜欢计划的变化，并将其视为完成平台的机会。“如果它发布了，就不会有多进程。我对此感到非常有压力。我很高兴我们放弃了 Sooner。软件进度与硬件进度根本不匹配。”
- en: Meanwhile, the team also built out the platform capabilities to support touchscreen
    functionality in 1.0\. Jason Parks said, “As soon as we flipped, Marco [Nelissen]
    got touch panels and hacked it up^([4](#c37-footnote-4)) and we had touch.”^([5](#c37-footnote-5))

  zh: 与此同时，团队也在构建平台能力，以支持1.0版中的触摸屏功能。Jason Parks说：“一旦我们转换，Marco [Nelissen] 得到触摸面板并进行了黑客修改^([4](#c37-footnote-4))，我们就有了触摸功能。”^([5](#c37-footnote-5))
- en: Swetland talked about the rumors that Android completely restarted development
    because of touch. “I feel like we should be honored that they believe we could
    completely reset and rebuild the entire world in three months, and not that we
    spent years ahead of time building up adaptive UI and the tooling that let us
    rejigger the world and had all this work done ahead of time.”

  zh: 斯威特兰谈到了关于Android因触摸屏而完全重新开始开发的传闻。“我觉得我们应该感到荣幸，他们认为我们能在三个月内完全重置并重建整个世界，而不是认为我们提前几年就开始建设适应性UI和工具，让我们能够重新构造这个世界，且所有这些工作都提前完成了。”
- en: But there were some misgivings on the team about the change. Mike Fleming said,
    “I was upset that we hadn’t shipped. I thought that we could’ve gotten out before
    the iPhone had we shipped the Sooner product.”
  id: totrans-16

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 但是团队中对于这一变化也有些许顾虑。迈克·弗莱明说：“我很沮丧，因为我们没有发布。我觉得如果我们发布了Sooner产品，我们本来可以在iPhone之前推出。”
- en: In any case, the team was definitely talking about the iPhone after the initial
    announcement. A lot. *The Brady Bunch* is a classic American sitcom from the early
    1970s. In one episode, Jan is tired of her older sister, Marsha, getting all of
    the attention. At one point, Jan exclaims, “Marsha, Marsha, Marsha!” Soon after
    the iPhone announcement, while the Android building was buzzing with discussions
    about the new device, Andy sent an email to the team that read, “iPhone, iPhone,
    iPhone!”

  zh: 无论如何，团队在初次发布后肯定在讨论iPhone，讨论得很多。*《布雷迪一家》*是1970年代初期的一部经典美国情景喜剧。在其中一集中，简厌倦了她姐姐玛莎总是得到所有的关注。某一时刻，简喊道：“玛莎，玛莎，玛莎！”在iPhone发布之后不久，当Android大楼里充满关于新设备的讨论时，安迪给团队发了一封邮件，内容是：“iPhone，iPhone，iPhone！”

  zh: 当iPhone发布时，用户看到了智能手机的新表现，具有更多功能和触摸屏驱动的用户界面。但运营商和制造商看到的是一个可能的垄断正在形成，一个将把他们排除在外的垄断。
- en: 'The iPhone was going to have a single manufacturer: Apple. All of the device
    manufacturers not named “Apple” would be cut out of that market. Also, the iPhone
    would initially work with only a single carrier in each market (such as AT&T in
    the US), ensuring that no other carriers would benefit from iPhone users (and
    their precious data usage) on their network until that exclusive contract expired.
    Other manufacturers in the ecosystem, such as chip vendors, were also afraid of
    being excluded; if Apple didn’t happen to choose their chips for iPhone hardware,
    then they too would be left out.'

  zh: iPhone将只有一个制造商：苹果。所有没有名为“苹果”的设备制造商将被排除在这个市场之外。而且，iPhone最初将在每个市场只与一个运营商合作（例如美国的AT&T），确保在该独占合同到期之前，其他运营商无法从iPhone用户（及其宝贵的数据使用）中受益。
- en: Suddenly, companies that had previously feared or disregarded Google were not
    only returning Google’s calls; they were approaching Google all on their own.
    They needed a comparable smartphone product, and Android offered a way to have
    one much sooner than they could have had otherwise.

    has said that they are related to the second part of the ciphertext. Note that
    there is an extra dash after `INTERPRETATI`, which could either mean that the
    final letter is a `U`, for `INTERPRETATU`, or, more likely, that the dash is the
    first character of the letter `O`, meaning that the entire word was intended to
    be `INTERPRETATION`. Similarly, `T IS YOUR POSITION` was probably originally `WHAT
    IS YOUR POSITION`. Sanborn has said he had longer messages on the sheets and then
    either cut the sheets in the middle of a message or allowed the messages to continue
    between the stone slabs.

    consists of at least four messages that are encrypted in different ways and are

- en: As of this writing, this thirty-year-old mystery remains unsolved. K4 has become
    one of the world’s most famous unsolved cryptograms, often mentioned in the same
    breath as the Beale ciphers, the Voynich manuscript, and the Zodiac Killer messages.
    A worldwide community of *Kryptos* enthusiasts, co-founded and headed by Elonka,
    focuses primarily on finding the solution to K4\. Elonka’s *Kryptos* website has
    become the most important source for all things concerning K4, the sculpture,
    and the other three ciphertexts.^([10](b06.xhtml#b01-endnote-10))

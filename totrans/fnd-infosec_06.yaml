    In several industries, you may even have to comply with more than one set of rules.
    While you’ll rarely encounter contradictory sets of standards, you may find that
    they disagree on the specifics. For example, one set of compliance rules might
    specify a one-year retention period for server backups, while another might specify
    six months. When faced with these situations, you’ll likely find yourself adopting
    the strictest set of items across all compliance efforts, for the sake of simplicity.

    put hundreds or thousands of hours toward complying with a specific set of rules

    carry out compliance to meet the needs of specific third parties—namely, your
    customers or business partners, auditors, and the compliance bodies responsible
    for ensuring your compliance. Compliance fulfills a business need rather than
    any technical security need. Furthermore, you are “compliant” whenever these third
    parties are satisfied with your efforts—regardless of how well you’ve actually
    met the requirements. An organization will usually put their “best foot forward”
    when the inspector comes.

    For example, organizations that accept credit cards must typically comply with
    the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), a set of rules created
    by a group of credit card issuers (including Visa, American Express, and Mastercard)
    for processing credit card transactions. The standard defines requirements for
    a security program, specific criteria for protecting data, and necessary security
    controls. Credit card issuers update the standard every few years to keep pace

    simply complete a self-assessment consisting of a short questionnaire. As the
    number of transactions grows, however, the requirements become progressively stringent,
    culminating in visits by specially certified external assessors, mandated penetration
    tests, requirements for internal and external vulnerability scanning, and a great

    administrative controls because you’re putting processes, procedures, and standards
    in place to prevent your organization from hurting itself by taking on too much
    risk. You’ll also have to document your administrative controls by keeping records
    of policies, procedures, and standards you’ve put in place and providing evidence

    show your policy in use. Proper documentation could include emails, tickets from
    your ticketing system, and files from investigations.

    to comply with the standard. Also, keep in mind that your controls are only as

    present an additional set of challenges. That’s because cloud offerings come in
    different models, each of which gives you a differing level of control over the
    environment. These models are *infrastructure as a service (IaaS)*, *platform
    as a service (PaaS)*, and *software as a service (SaaS)*, as shown in [Figure

    you with access to a specific application or application suite, as in the case
    of Google Apps.

    of the environment that the users can’t control. That means that, in some cases,

    and servers on which the virtual infrastructure exists. In other words, it’s responsible
    for securing and maintaining the hosts (the servers that run the virtual machines),
    the storage arrays on which the customer’s storage volumes reside, and the networks
    used by the hosts, among other components. Because IaaS gives you a large amount
    of control over the environment and how it is configured, it requires you to adopt
    a greater level of responsibility.

    can’t access the infrastructure that runs those servers. In this case, the cloud
    provider assumes responsibility for the security of that infrastructure, including
    tasks such as patching the operating system, configuring the servers, backing
    up the servers, and maintaining storage volumes.

- en: Your contract with the cloud provider generally stipulates your right to audit
    and assess the security of the cloud environment. In many cases, the service allows
    customers to audit and assess the environment within certain specific bounds.
    For instance, it might stipulate how and when you can ask the provider for an
    audit by your internal audit team or a third-party audit company. These limits
    are reasonable, since responding to each audit request takes a lot of work. The
    provider might also respond to audit requests by providing the result of an annual
    external audit conducted expressly for the purposes of responding to requests
    such as these.

- en: If you hope to directly assess the security of a cloud provider, perhaps with
    a penetration test (which I’ll discuss in depth in [Chapter 14](ch14.xhtml)),
    you might meet resistance. Many providers deny such requests outright or allow
    penetration tests only under very specific and tightly restricted conditions.
    This is also understandable for many of the same reasons that they might limit
    audits. Additionally, active security testing often impacts the infrastructure,
    platform, or application being tested, and the provider might experience service
    issues as a result.

    recorded to the ledger as a block, and each block is attached to the previous
    block in the chain by a one-way mathematical handshake (similar to a hash, as
    discussed in [Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml)). Each participant has a copy of the blockchain,
    and the consensus of 51 percent of participants defines the accepted chain (generally
    the longest chain).

    record something to blockchain, you can, with a high degree of certainty, say
    that it wasn’t altered when you look at it later. For example, Walmart uses this
    technology to track the path of its food products from the supplier with which
    they originate to the stores that will sell them to customers.[⁹](notes.xhtml#ch06fn9)

    an understanding of how blockchain works. For example, people often cite the use
    of blockchain as an indelible record that you can write to something and never
    be concerned with that data being altered. Unfortunately, this is true only under
    certain conditions. You can force consensus on blockchain by controlling 51 percent
    of the participants, at which point you can write whatever you like to it. Some
    companies have even gone as far as to promote “private” blockchains, which really
    amounts to just using encryption to ensure the integrity of the data. Someone
    trying to regulate blockchain should understand what drawbacks there may be in
    using it; if you rush from one hot new technology to the next, you may be putting
    in place controls that are, in actuality, only security theater.

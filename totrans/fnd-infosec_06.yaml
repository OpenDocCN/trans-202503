    shared resources. If you’re using cloud resources on the same host server as another
    company, that company’s lack of security could easily impact the security of your
    systems, as well.

    as SaaS, because you share a larger portion of the environment with other customers.
    You may have data intermingled with that of other customers in the same database,
    with only the application logic keeping your data apart from theirs.

    server resources to host virtual machines and some of the same storage space,
    a sharp divide exists between your resources and the resources of others.

- en: Blockchain is a distributed and uneditable digital ledger. Transactions are
    recorded to the ledger as a block, and each block is attached to the previous
    block in the chain by a one-way mathematical handshake (similar to a hash, as
    discussed in [Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml)). Each participant has a copy of the blockchain,
    and the consensus of 51 percent of participants defines the accepted chain (generally
    the longest chain).

- en: In security terms, blockchain promises a strong form of integrity. When you
    record something to blockchain, you can, with a high degree of certainty, say
    that it wasn’t altered when you look at it later. For example, Walmart uses this
    technology to track the path of its food products from the supplier with which
    they originate to the stores that will sell them to customers.[⁹](notes.xhtml#ch06fn9)

- en: When it comes to compliance, it’s important to create controls that demonstrate
    an understanding of how blockchain works. For example, people often cite the use
    of blockchain as an indelible record that you can write to something and never
    be concerned with that data being altered. Unfortunately, this is true only under
    certain conditions. You can force consensus on blockchain by controlling 51 percent
    of the participants, at which point you can write whatever you like to it. Some
    companies have even gone as far as to promote “private” blockchains, which really
    amounts to just using encryption to ensure the integrity of the data. Someone
    trying to regulate blockchain should understand what drawbacks there may be in
    using it; if you rush from one hot new technology to the next, you may be putting
    in place controls that are, in actuality, only security theater.

- en: A *cryptocurrency* is a form of digital currency often based on the use of blockchain.
    Cryptocurrencies are unquestionably a disruptive technology. The first cryptocurrency,
    Bitcoin, appeared in 2009 and has enjoyed a wild variance in value between now
    and then.

- en: Bitcoin generates currency through the same means it uses to keep the underlying
    blockchain functioning. To attach each block in the Bitcoin to the chain, as discussed,
    it needs to be verified with a mathematical handshake. This function requires
    some level of computing power from all of those participating in the blockchain,
    and as an incentive, those who participate are rewarded with a Bitcoin. This process
    of generating new Bitcoins is known as *Bitcoin mining*.

- en: In February 2019, Gerald Cotton, the founder of Quadriga (which at the time
    was the largest cryptocurrency exchange in Canada), reportedly perished suddenly.
    Cotton, a security-minded fellow, maintained the entire exchange from offline
    accounts stored on his highly encrypted laptop. Upon his death, the entirety of
    the approximately $190 million in cryptocurrency held by the exchange across 115,000
    clients vanished into thin air as his laptop became inaccessible. As of this writing,
    the exact circumstances surrounding this incident are still under investigation,
    although there are rumors that the incident involved some sort of chicanery.

    that govern financial transactions, as well as those that define the rules for
    investors and reporting to them. The use of cryptocurrency in business at all
    is still a gray area, although many businesses do so. It is all but certain, however,
    that you would, as an organization, be unable to shrug off a multimillion-dollar
    loss due to a cryptocurrency technology failure without serious repercussions
    from a legal and regulatory perspective.

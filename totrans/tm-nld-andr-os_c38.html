<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">B</span>ob Borchers was the Senior Director of iPhone Product Marketing<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c38-footnote-1" id="c38-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup> at Apple during the iPhone’s development and when it launched.</p>
<p>Bob was in the original iPhone tutorial video on the Apple website when the iPhone was launched. What was remarkable about that video was not so much that it was an iPhone tutorial, or that it featured Bob, but that it was not starring Steve Jobs. Apple is famous in the industry for hiding most of the personalities in the company behind very closed doors. Only select <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_308" title="308"/>people are anointed to be the face that represents the company. At that time, it was (of course) mostly Steve Jobs. </p>
<p>A friend who worked there explained it to me. Apple is a consumer brand. It is not, unlike companies like Google or Microsoft, about the technology, and therefore the engineers and engineering itself, but rather about consumer products that happen to be built with technology. Presenting a very slick, polished, and consistent face to the world is part of that consumer-branding approach.</p>
<p>Bob explained how he came to be in that video. “When Steve introduced NeXT, he did a video where he sat down for an hour and a half and introduced everybody to NextStep, the OS as well as the hardware, showed them all the great things, and helped people build their first program on NextStep. When we were thinking about how to introduce the iPhone to the world, we took that template and said, ‘Let’s do it again here.’ Initially our job was to write a rough script, and for me to be the test presenter. As it turns out, that test run turned into months of wearing a black shirt on camera.” When the team was ready to record the final version, Steve was too busy, so Bob got that job.</p>
<p>At the time, stories had been circulating at Apple about what was happening at Google. “There were rumors that Google was going to do something around a mobile operating system. It wasn’t just, ‘There was going to be this amazing piece of hardware,’ it was, ‘They’re going to build a platform that others can use.’”</p>
<p>Bob was able to nail down the timeframe for some of those rumors because he had a meeting with Google at that time. “October of 2006. I remember, because the first meeting I had [at Google] with the team that we were negotiating with, the lead product manager showed up in a nun’s costume. The first Apple, iPhone, Google, Maps coming-together moment was Halloween of 2006. I sat in a meeting room for 2 hours with a nun. A male nun at that.”</p>
<p>But why was Apple concerned specifically with Google, especially since Google had zero track record with mobile devices? There were already plenty of other players in the mobile space, including RIM and Nokia and Microsoft. “Microsoft was already in the market with Windows Mobile. Our analysis was, Microsoft didn’t know hardware, so that was a horrible experience. All of the other players didn’t know software. We felt like software was going to be the thing that ate the mobile world.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_309" title="309"/>“The big threat from Google was that Google knew software and services. In fact, probably knew them better than Apple did. So I think the fundamental concern was, here’s Google, a company that’s built software and services at scale before, and that could and would legitimately be a significant threat to a new platform like iOS.</p>
<p>“The other point was that Google was the only other company that had no existing business to put at risk when working with carriers.”</p>
<p>Apple was very interested to see what the result was when the first Android device, the G1, launched. “I remember going, on the first day that they were available, to the store in San Francisco to buy one and bring it back to Cupertino to play with. The software experience was. . . . We saw potential.” The actual G1 product didn’t cause much fear in Cupertino.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c38-footnote-2" id="c38-footnoteref-2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Apple wasn’t as concerned about Android, or at least about the G1, after they saw the device, because they really saw themselves as competing on the product level, not the platform level: “We weren’t really thinking of iOS as a platform. When we officially launched the first SDK and the App Store, which was like two or three years into it—that’s when we started to think of it as a platform.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Android beat Apple to the application marketplace, and Android 1.0 shipped with the Android Market app that allowed developers to distribute their own applications. The iPhone had originally shipped without any App Store at all, and no intention to provide one. </p>
<p>After the iPhone was available, there was mounting interest in having more apps. “There was so much developer desire and so many requests. The first step was to go build web apps. That was perfect, because nobody was actually installing any software on the phone, but you can have an app-like experience. Our hope was that web apps were going to be the thing.”</p>
<p>But eventually, Apple was pressured by both consumers and developers to provide a way for developers to provide high-quality native apps for the iPhone. “We were utterly focused on the consumer experience, and consumers were telling us that they wanted higher quality applications, as developers were telling us they wanted to build higher quality applications.” The App Store was launched, with a more curated model than Android, in keeping with Apple’s approach to controlling the overall experience more tightly.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_310" title="310"/>Bob also commented on the effect that the iPhone had on carriers. The iPhone launched with an exclusive deal with AT&amp;T in the US, and similar exclusive carrier deals in other countries. This forced other carriers like T-Mobile and Verizon to seek other options. “We early on established that we were going to launch exclusively with one carrier in each market. That meant that there would be two or three other carriers in every market who needed to fill up that vacuum some way, somehow. So there was a vacuum created for Android to fill.”</p>
<p>Bob left Apple<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c38-footnote-3" id="c38-footnoteref-3">3</a></sup> in 2009, two years after the iPhone was released.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c38-footnote-4" id="c38-footnoteref-4">4</a></sup></p>

<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c38-footnoteref-1" id="c38-footnote-1">1.</a></sup>  One of the people I interviewed for this book said it would be really cool to know what Apple was thinking back then. It seemed like a pipe dream. I thought it unlikely that, if I showed up at the Apple campus, they’d usher me in and have a chat about what the corporate thinking was on whatever was happening on the Cupertino campus 12 years ago.</p>  
<p>And then I realized: I happened to know someone that might help. I met Bob Borchers at a school event my kids were in, recognizing him as the guy in the original iPhone tutorial on the Apple website. I recognized him again, years later, when he was on my bus home from work one evening; Bob had recently joined Google.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley is a really small place. It’s a ridiculously expensive and crowded place, but it’s really small in terms of the people and companies that overlap in different and interesting ways.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c38-footnoteref-2" id="c38-footnote-2">2.</a></sup>  Apple headquarters are located in Cupertino, CA, in the heart of Silicon Valley.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c38-footnoteref-3" id="c38-footnote-3">3.</a></sup>  At the time, back in 2009, I asked Bob what it was like to not be at Apple anymore. He said, “Well . . . Steve no longer yells at me.”</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c38-footnoteref-4" id="c38-footnote-4">4.</a></sup>  At the time of my interview with Bob, he was the Vice President of Marketing for Platforms &amp; Ecosystems at Google (including Android and Chrome). By the time I finished the book, he was back at Apple, as a VP of Product Marketing. In Silicon Valley, it’s not just the devices that are mobile; the people are, too.</p></aside>

In addition, sculpting allows for much more freedom in the route taken to create a model; prior to its introduction, we had to labor to create topology to support each element of a model. Now, with sculpting, we can start from a much simpler mesh, use multiresolution subdivision to provide the level of control necessary to support the forms we want, and worry about the topology later.</p><p>In this chapter, we’ll introduce Blender’s sculpting tools and show you how to use Sculpt mode. We’ll look at customizing the appearance of Sculpt mode and the tools you can use to get the most out of Blender when sculpting. Then, we’ll move on to using these tools to start sculpting on the base meshes we created in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Blocking In">Chapter 4</a>, taking them from simple, low-res base meshes to highly detailed, sculpted models. Finally, we’ll look at some general principles for sculpting.</p><div class="sect1" title="Sculpt Mode"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="sculpt_mode">Sculpt Mode</h2></div></div></div><p>In order to sculpt in Blender, you’ll need to enter Sculpt mode in the 3D Viewport, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#sculpt_modecomma_with_the_viewport_displ" title="Figure 6-1. Sculpt mode, with the Viewport display mode set to Textured (with GLSL shading) and Only Render enabled.

Once in Sculpt mode, make sure you have the Tool Shelf open (<span class="strong"><strong>T</strong></span>), as this is where you’ll find all of Blender’s Sculpt mode options and tools.</p><p>The familiar Tool Shelf on the left of the Viewport is now home to our Brush options for sculpting, where we can choose between different brushes and adjust their settings. Brush options include the type of brush; whether it will utilize pressure input from a graphics tablet (recommended if you have one); and the size, falloff, and shape of the brush. <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#sculpt_modecomma_with_the_viewport_displ" title="Figure 6-1. Sculpt mode, with the Viewport display mode set to Textured (with GLSL shading) and Only Render enabled.

The Tool Shelf, on the left, contains most of Blender’s sculpting tools and options.">Figure 6-1</a> in order (some are collapsed, but their titles are all visible), we have the following:</p><p title="Brush"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Brush</strong></span></strong></span>. Here, you can select which brush to use; the brush properties, such as radius, strength, and autosmooth; whether the brush should add or subtract from the surface; and some options specific to individual brushes. You can also create new brushes from the Brush selector by clicking the + icon. Doing so will duplicate the current brush, creating a copy that you can modify separately.</p><p title="Texture"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Texture</strong></span></strong></span>. This panel allows you to create strokes with unique shapes and textures or to drag out patterns onto the surface of your mesh. Brush textures use the brightness of the texture to determine how strongly to apply the brushstroke. While you can use color images for brushes, it’s more common to simply use black and white textures to make it easier to judge their effects. (In order to distinguish brush textures from other kinds of textures, I’ll often refer to them as <span class="emphasis"><em>alphas</em></span>.)</p><p title="Tool"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Tool</strong></span></strong></span>. While the brushes in the Brush selector have names like Clay and Smooth, you can change these names as you please. The actual behavior of any brush is determined by the choices you make in the drop-down menu in this panel, which allows you to choose from all of the base tool types Blender has to offer before customizing them further.</p><p title="Stroke"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Stroke</strong></span></strong></span>. This panel contains options for how your mouse or tablet strokes are converted into sculpting strokes. The default method for most brushes, <span class="emphasis"><em>Space</em></span>, creates a uniform brushstroke. <span class="emphasis"><em>Anchored</em></span> allows you to click and drag out a large <a id="iddle1057" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1076" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1192" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1217" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1248" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1313" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1332" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1836" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2323" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2343" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2350" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2354" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2449" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2457" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2604" class="indexterm"/>stroke over your mesh, centered around the starting point of the stroke and with a radius determined by how far you drag. This option is extremely useful for dragging out textures over the surface of your mesh in order to create surface detail. Another option, <span class="emphasis"><em>Smooth Stroke</em></span>, causes your strokes to lag behind your cursor as you pull it around, resulting in clean, smooth curves.</p><p title="Curve"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Curve</strong></span></strong></span>. This panel lets you choose the brush’s falloff curve (see <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#different_falloff_settings" title="Figure 6-2. Different Falloff settings">Figure 6-2</a>) and gives you fine control over how the depth of your strokes fades away from the center. You can either define the curve manually by dragging and clicking to move and adding points to the Curve editor, or you can choose one of the presets from the icons below the Curve editor. The default <span class="emphasis"><em>Smooth</em></span> curve is fine for most brushes, but when dragging out alphas, the flat <span class="emphasis"><em>Max</em></span> curve is useful. For fine creases, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Sharp</em></span> curve is best.</p><div class="figure"><a id="different_falloff_settings"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00098"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538438.png.jpg" alt="Different Falloff settings"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 6-2. Different Falloff settings</div></div><p title="Options"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Options</strong></span></strong></span>. This panel contains mainly miscellaneous options. One option is whether to constrain sculpting to individual axes. Another determines whether to keep your brush size and strength universal or to let you set it for each brush. (Maintaining a universal brush size is often less confusing, but it’s usually preferable to choose strength for each brush individually, as you may want different strengths for different tools.)</p><p title="Symmetry"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Symmetry</strong></span></strong></span>. Just as you would use a Mirror modifier for a normal mesh, you can enable Symmetry when sculpting to keep your brushstrokes symmetrical. This is a useful option for a lot of sculpting as most organic creatures are broadly symmetrical.</p><p title="Appearance"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Appearance</strong></span></strong></span>. This panel contains some aesthetic options for changing the color of the brush cursor or adding a custom icon for your brush.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Brush Types"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="brush_types">Brush Types</h3></div></div></div><p>The default brush types, which are found in the Tool panel (see <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#tool_panel_lets_you_choose_between_the_d" title="Figure 6-3. The Tool panel lets you choose between the different base brush types.">Figure 6-3</a>), are discussed below. Some have hotkeys (in brackets) that allow you to quickly cycle through any brushes of that type that you have created. Almost all brushes (Grab, Nudge, Thumb, and Snake Hook are the only exceptions) also have a Subtractive mode (<span class="smaller">ALT</span>) that usually does the opposite of what the brush does in Additive mode.</p><p title="Blob"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Blob</strong></span></strong></span>. This brush type creates blob-like inflated lumps in the surface of your mesh. This option is a bit of a mix between the Draw and Inflate brushes. Additive mode builds out, while Subtractive cuts in.</p><div class="figure"><a id="tool_panel_lets_you_choose_between_the_d"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00099"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538440.png.jpg" alt="The Tool panel lets you choose between the different base brush types."/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 6-3. The Tool panel lets you choose between the different base brush types.</div></div><p title="Clay (C)"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Clay (C)</strong></span></strong></span>. One of the most important brush types, the Clay brush builds up the surface of your mesh evenly, filling valleys first and then building up smoothly from the surface of the mesh. You’ll find this brush type useful throughout the sculpting process, though beware when adding fine details, as it will build up over them (use the Draw brush instead). Additive mode builds out, and Subtractive mode carves into the mesh.</p><p title="Crease (SHIFT-C)"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Crease (<span class="smaller">SHIFT</span>-C)</strong></span></strong></span>. This brush type combines the Draw and Pinch brush types, drawing a stroke out on the mesh and then pinching it to make it tighter. It is most useful in Subtractive mode, where it’s great for creating wrinkles and creases in a character’s skin, but it can also be used in Additive mode to create sharp edges by tracing along the edge of a form.</p><p title="Draw (D)"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Draw (D)</strong></span></strong></span>. <a id="iddle1417" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1506" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1524" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1581" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1646" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1721" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1968" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2079" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2212" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2253" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2258" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2357" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2560" class="indexterm"/>The Draw brush type draws a stroke out from the surface, moving the surface without changing the details underneath. If you use Draw early on when sculpting large-scale forms, it may make life difficult, as it can result in a rather lumpy look (which is why the Clay brush is more useful). Later on though, when adding fine details, the Draw brush type is very handy.</p><p title="Fill"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Fill</strong></span></strong></span>. This brush type fills in valleys in the surface of the mesh without touching the peaks. It is useful for smoothing out and filling in concave areas in a mesh without affecting the surrounding areas. Subtractive mode deepens the valleys instead of filling them in.</p><p title="Flatten"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Flatten</strong></span></strong></span>. The Flatten brush combines the Fill and Scrape brush types, filling in valleys and scraping away peaks to create a smoother surface. Unlike the Smooth brush type, this brush flattens the surface in addition to smoothing it. In Subtractive mode, this brush type exaggerates the valleys and peaks instead of flattening them.</p><p title="Grab (G)"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Grab (G)</strong></span></strong></span>. This brush type grabs the area under the brush and lets you pull it around. You’ll find this to be a very useful brush type.</p><p title="Inflate (I)"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Inflate (I)</strong></span></strong></span>. The Inflate brush type inflates the mesh in much the same way the Shrink/Fatten operator does in Edit mode. Inflate is useful for establishing volumes and is sometimes a good alternative to the Draw or Clay brushes, but be sure to keep the strength of this brush low or it can do some damage. Also, be aware that in addition to pushing the surface outward (or inward), this brush usually makes faces bigger, reducing the amount of detail that the modified area can support. In Subtractive mode, this brush shrinks the mesh instead, often causing the mesh to self-intersect. Use it carefully.</p><p title="Layer (L)"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Layer (L)</strong></span></strong></span>. This brush type builds out an even layer from the surface of your mesh or subtracts an even layer in Subtractive mode.</p><p title="Nudge"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Nudge</strong></span></strong></span>. Like the Grab brush type, this brush type only nudges the mesh a small distance, and you can keep moving your cursor around to other areas to nudge them as well.</p><p title="Pinch (P)"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Pinch (P)</strong></span></strong></span>. This brush type pulls faces under the brush closer together, creating a pinching effect. This brush is useful for tightening creases and wrinkles or for sharpening edges between forms on hard-surface sculpts. In Subtractive mode, this brush pushes the faces farther apart.</p><p title="Rotate"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Rotate</strong></span></strong></span>. This brush type rotates the area under the brush around the mesh’s origin. I find this pretty useless as a brush type.</p><p title="Scrape"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Scrape</strong></span></strong></span>. The Scrape brush type scrapes away the peaks of a mesh without touching the valleys. This brush type is really useful for establishing planes, eliminating lumps and bumps, and smoothing transitions between overlapping forms. Subtractive mode builds the peaks up rather than scraping them down.</p><p title="Snake Hook"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Snake Hook</strong></span></strong></span>. This brush type allows you to pull out a tentacle-like surface from your mesh. Use this brush type sparingly because the topology underneath will probably not support it too well. This option is good for pulling out peaks to look like strands of hair or horns, especially if you plan on correcting the ugly topology later.</p><p title="Thumb"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Thumb</strong></span></strong></span>. The Thumb brush type slides the surface of the mesh around under the brush but only on the plane of the direction the surface is facing. This is similar to the Grab brush, except that it allows you only to shift the surface of the mesh around rather than letting you push or pull the surface of the mesh outward or inward.</p><p>All of the brushes in Blender’s Brush panel (see <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#blenderapostrophes_default_sculpt_brushe" title="Figure 6-4. Blender’s default sculpt brushes">Figure 6-4</a>) are just variations on the types listed above, with various tweaks to give each brush slightly different effects. For example, the Polish brush is a variation on the Flatten brush with the Autosmooth setting (which adds a smoothing effect to any brushstroke) turned up.</p><div class="figure"><a id="blenderapostrophes_default_sculpt_brushe"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00100"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538442.png.jpg" alt="Blender’s default sculpt brushes"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 6-4. Blender’s default sculpt brushes</div></div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Creating Custom Brushes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="creating_custom_brushes">Creating Custom Brushes</h2></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1209" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1214" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1253" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1639" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2257" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2532" class="indexterm"/>Now that we’ve taken a look at some of Blender’s built-in brushes, let’s look at how to create custom ones to better suit our needs. As explained earlier, Blender’s sculpting brushes are all variations on the same initial set of brush types; the differences come from changing the settings that affect how these brushes function. You’ll want to change some settings frequently, like the radius of the brush and its strength. If you end up using a certain set of brush settings often, it’s a good idea just to give them their own brush.</p><p>To create a new sculpting brush, select an existing one similar to the one you want to create, and then press the + icon in the Brush selector next to its name to create a new, unique brush. Now, modify the new brush by changing its strength, assigning textures and stroke options, and so on.</p><p>To demonstrate, let’s create a few custom brushes that will come in handy when sculpting.</p><div class="sect2" title="Clay Tubes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="clay_tubes">Clay Tubes</h3></div></div></div><p>The Clay Tubes brush (see <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#clay_tubes_brush" title="Figure 6-5. The Clay Tubes brush">Figure 6-5</a>) will be great for sculpting early on. It works the way traditional clay sculptors work by adding strips of clay to the surface of a sculpture to build up forms. To create a brush that mimics this technique in Blender, take the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Duplicate the default Clay brush.</p><div class="figure"><a id="clay_tubes_brush"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00101"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538444.png.jpg" alt="The Clay Tubes brush"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 6-5. The Clay Tubes brush</div></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>In the Texture panel, add a new texture to use as an alpha for the brush by clicking the + icon in the Texture selector.

Now we’ll have nice square strokes with a slight texture that will be great for building up forms like muscles and wrinkles and for quickly blocking in large shapes.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>To stop the usual falloff of the brush, set the falloff curve to the flat <span class="strong"><strong>Max</strong></span> preset in the Curve panel.</p></li></ol></div><div class="figure"><a id="adding_the_clay_tubes_texture"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00102"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538446.png.jpg" alt="Adding the Clay Tubes texture"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 6-6. Adding the Clay Tubes texture</div></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Rake"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="rake">Rake</h3></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle2137" class="indexterm"/>Like the Clay Tubes brush, the Rake brush (see <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#rake_brush" title="Figure 6-7. The Rake brush">Figure 6-7</a>) is based on traditional sculpting. Clay sculptors often use a toothed scraping tool, a <span class="emphasis"><em>rake</em></span>, to scrape away at the clay surface to produce a fine texture and smooth forms. In Blender, the Rake brush is great in both Additive <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> Subtractive modes.</p><p>Like the Clay Tubes brush, the Rake brush starts out by duplicating the default Clay brush and then adding a custom alpha, though this time we use a line of blurred dots or squares, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#rake_brush" title="Figure 6-7. The Rake brush">Figure 6-7</a>.

For example, if your base mesh is only six faces, most strokes will affect a large percentage of faces in the base mesh (at least one-sixth), making it slower for Blender to update its shape. By subdividing first, each stroke will affect a much smaller percentage of faces in the base mesh, so there is less for Blender to update on screen, speeding up you sculpting experience.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Customizing the 3D Viewport"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="customizing_the_3d_viewport">Customizing the 3D Viewport</h3></div></div></div><p>When sculpting, we generally want to see only what we’re working on, without distractions like lamps and the grid floor.

Googling around will turn up plenty of good MatCap textures, too.</p><p>It’s also worth creating your own MatCap images. Whenever you have a material you like the look of, try applying it to a sphere and rendering it out to use as a MatCap material. (Just remember to crop your image to just inside the outline of the sphere to avoid getting any artifacts around the edges of your mesh.)

The Multires modifier is similar to the Subsurf modifier in that it subdivides your model using either Catmull-Clark or Simple subdivision <span class="gray-background">1</span>. However, instead of being purely procedural, the Multires modifier will store further editing of your mesh in Sculpt mode, allowing you to first subdivide your mesh and then use the extra geometry this creates to sculpt in extra detail. This lets us subdivide a fairly basic model into millions of polygons and allows us to sculpt them into whatever shapes and with whatever details we want.</p><p>The three settings on the left of the Multires modifier panel (Preview, Sculpt, and Render <span class="gray-background">2</span>) determine the level of subdivision shown in different modes. Preview sets the display level for Object mode, Sculpt the level for Sculpt mode, and Render the subdivision level used when rendering the mesh. The Subdivide operator <span class="gray-background">3</span> adds another level of subdivision each time you click it, while the Delete Higher operator <span class="gray-background">4</span> deletes any subdivision levels above the one you are currently working on.</p><p>If you happen to export your mesh to another program, or duplicate and edit it separately, you can use the Reshape operator <span class="gray-background">5</span> to reshape your Multires mesh to be the same as that of another selected object. In order to do this, though, both meshes must have identical vertex order and topology, and any deletion or adding of vertices will break this functionality. If you’re exporting to another program (like ZBrush or MeshLab), be sure to use the .<span class="emphasis"><em>obj</em></span> format and ensure that the Keep Vertex Order option is checked when importing and exporting.</p><p>The Multires modifier does not affect the original shape of your mesh; however, you can use the Apply Base operator <span class="gray-background">6</span> to fit the lowest subdivision level (your original mesh) to the shape of the subdivided mesh.

In general, we’ll sculpt from coarse to fine, just like sculpture in the real world. By beginning with the broad structure of the final product we want to achieve and working toward the fine details, we reduce the number of steps we need to undo in order to correct errors.</p><p>This section will introduce you to some general concepts in the order I think about them when sculpting.</p><p title="Volumes and proportion"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Volumes and proportion</strong></span></strong></span>. When beginning to sculpt, first set out the rough shape of your subject; in other words, create a rough volume for each component of your overall figure. When sculpting a character, you should block out the volumes of the legs, arms, torso, head, hands, and feet. This is accomplished partly by creating a good base mesh. For example, we already created the basic shape of the Bat Creature character in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Blocking In">Chapter 4</a>; however, this can still be refined and improved while sculpting to give a better feel for the size and overall shape of the model.</p><p title="Gesture"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Gesture</strong></span></strong></span>. Gesture describes the stance of a character and the flow of forms from one body part to another. This stage applies more to posed characters but is an important part of creating a good neutral pose, and even applies when sculpting inorganic forms. Key at this stage is that the forms of the body are connected by smooth, flowing curves. You should usually be able to draw a smooth curve through your character’s pose, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#try_to_establish_smooth_curves_that_flow" title="Figure 6-16. Try to establish smooth curves that flow through your characters">Figure 6-16</a>.</p><p title="Planes"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Planes</strong></span></strong></span>. By planes, I mean breaking down and simplifying the form of the object into flat planes—areas of the object that form broadly flat surfaces rather than polygons. The direction and placement of the planes in your sculpture determine how the surfaces of your objects catch light, creating patterns that in turn play a large part in how we read and recognize shapes.</p><p>Even though you’ll ultimately smooth out these planes, they’ll still influence your finished object. For example, the planes in a human or humanoid character are largely defined by the object’s major anatomical landmarks, such as the bony parts of the skull, ribcage, collar bones, and pelvis. In <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#planes_of_the_headdot_you_donapostrophet" title="Figure 6-17. The planes of the head. You don’t need to define planes to this extent, but keep them in mind.">Figure 6-17</a>, the main large planes are defined by the shape of the skull; these planes include those along the side of the head, along the jawline and chin, and down the bridge of the nose. Smaller secondary planes form the shapes of the ears, lips, and nostrils. (You don’t actually need to define the planes of your model too rigorously, as they will be smoothed out later, but it is important to know and roughly mark in where they are.)</p><div class="figure"><a id="try_to_establish_smooth_curves_that_flow"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00112"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538466.png.jpg" alt="Try to establish smooth curves that flow through your characters"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 6-16. Try to establish smooth curves that flow through your characters</div></div><p title="Coarse details and anatomy"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Coarse details and anatomy</strong></span></strong></span>. Once you’ve finished creating the main volumes and planes of your sculpture, you’ll find that many of the anatomical details are actually already present, though there are still many anatomical features to be added to the final sculpt. Achieving anatomical realism in your sculpts takes practice and is a matter of gathering and studying anatomical references and then placing and refining those anatomical landmarks on your sculpt.</p><p>One way to begin filling in the details is to start with the major muscle groups and skeletal landmarks and then progress to smaller details like the musculature and small features like fingers, ears, eyes, and so on.

This is a fun stage that can add a lot of character to a model. One thing to note at this stage is that, particularly with organic characters that aren’t heavily muscled, much of the anatomical detail you may have added will need to be toned down. You can either omit these details earlier in the sculpting process (but consider where they will be under the surface nonetheless) or smooth them away in areas where you need a subtler effect. Finally, you can start adding smaller details, like wrinkles, pores, scars, and so on. We can start smoothing and polishing out any artifacts we have created earlier while sculpting and then add more deliberate fine details.</p><div class="figure"><a id="planes_of_the_headdot_you_donapostrophet"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00113"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538468.png.jpg" alt="The planes of the head.

They take you from a rough overall shape to something with the key features you are trying to create and then allow you to re-create the finer details. Now let’s apply these stages to sculpting the Bat Creature and Spider Bot.</p><div class="figure"><a id="fine_details_can_be_dealt_with_once_the"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00114"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538470.png.jpg" alt="Fine details can be dealt with once the major forms are in place."/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 6-18. Fine details can be dealt with once the major forms are in place.</div></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Sculpting the Bat Creature"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="sculpting_the_bat_creature">Sculpting the Bat Creature</h2></div></div></div><p>For the Bat Creature, I began with a couple of simple base meshes that had topology to support most of the features I needed (though nothing for the face). Then I could begin developing the forms of the Bat Creature into something more interesting and add further details, such as some musculature and facial features.</p><p>To begin, I took the base mesh and added a Multires modifier and a few subdivisions. The initial aim was to add enough resolution to allow me to begin refining the volumes and defining basic planes and landmarks—but not so much that I would get sucked into adding details too early. When sculpting, try to make the most out of each level of subdivision before adding the next level.</p><div class="sect2" title="Volumes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="volumes">Volumes</h3></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1249" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1314" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1584" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1647" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2087" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2272" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2277" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2682" class="indexterm"/>I began by adding volume to the legs and arms with the Inflate tool (see <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#bat_creature_volumes_subdivided_base_mes" title="Figure 6-19. Bat Creature volumes: Subdivided base mesh before sculpting volumes (left) and the basic large volumes roughly added using the Grab and Inflate brushes (right). At this stage, I was concerned with refining the overall shape of the character into one with the right volumes and proportions, mainly by inflating and deflating or by smoothing out the forms at a low subdivision level. I could also tweak certain proportions in the base mesh.">Figure 6-19</a>). The Inflate tool is particularly handy at low subdivision levels for enlarging basic masses and giving them a nice rounded shape. The Clay tool is also handy for building up mass in a specific place. (It’s easy to make forms thinner again with the Smooth tool or with the Inflate tool in Subtractive mode.)</p><p>On the Bat’s torso, I began separating the bulk of the ribcage or chest from the pelvis and adding some muscle mass on the back for the shoulders. The Bat Creature is a character with wings coming out of its back, so large muscles on the back are expected.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Planes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="planes">Planes</h3></div></div></div><p>Next, I began sculpting the figure’s basic planes. Because I was adding more definition at this point, I first added a few more subdivision levels, bringing the overall polycount to a few hundred thousand polygons. The aim here was first to find the bony landmarks of the body, such as the top and bottom of the ribcage, the iliac crests of the pelvis, the knees and elbows, and the skull (see <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#stages_in_laying_out_the_major_planes_of" title="Figure 6-20. Stages in laying out the major planes of the body">Figure 6-20</a>, Landmarks).</p><p>As a first step, you can roughly mark these points with a light impression from the Clay brush. Next, you can place the secondary forms of the major muscle groups using these landmarks as a guide. To do this, simply add and subtract mass with the Clay brushes (<a class="xref" href="ch06.html#stages_in_laying_out_the_major_planes_of" title="Figure 6-20. Stages in laying out the major planes of the body">Figure 6-20</a>, Masses). Then you can begin flattening these masses out into the main planes of the body using the Flatten, Scrape, and Fill brushes (<a class="xref" href="ch06.html#stages_in_laying_out_the_major_planes_of" title="Figure 6-20. Stages in laying out the major planes of the body">Figure 6-20</a>, Planes). Using the Crease brush at this stage will allow you to create better divisions between planes in Subtractive mode (the default behavior for this brush); this brush can also be used in Additive mode to add sharp edges to planes that face outward.</p><p>A good way to plan and keep track of the details you want to create is to sketch the muscle groups with Blender’s grease pencil, using the Surface drawing setting (see <a class="xref" href="ch06.html#left_sketching_out_muscle_groups_and_lan" title="Figure 6-21. Left: Sketching out muscle groups and landmarks with the grease pencil.

In Object mode and with your mesh selected, add a new grease pencil layer, set the draw mode to <span class="strong"><strong>Surface</strong></span>, and then draw strokes on the surface of your mesh by holding down <span class="strong"><strong>D</strong></span> and clicking to draw. Now you can sketch any anatomical landmarks on your sculpt before actually sculpting them in.

There are several ways to approach this, each with its advantages and disadvantages. One way is to use the Shrink Wrap modifier: first adding a Multires modifier to your new mesh, then subdividing a few times, adding Shrink Wrap modifier, and setting the original mesh as the target. This can work reasonably well for simpler sculpts, but for more complex objects, it can create some artifacts and errors that will take time to straighten out. As such, for more complex sculpts, a better method is to use a displacement map.</p><div class="sect3" title="About Displacement Maps"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="about_displacement_maps">About Displacement Maps</h4></div></div></div><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>displacement map</em></span> is an image texture that defines how to displace the surface of a mesh according to the value of the texture: White areas cause the surface to be raised, and black areas are pushed in. By UV unwrapping the mesh and applying a displacement map to the new mesh, you can transfer the details of the old sculpt to the new mesh.</p><p>To create a displacement map, use Blender’s texture-baking tools to calculate the distances between the surfaces of the original sculpt and the newly retopologized mesh and to bake them into an image. Then, by using the Displace modifier (combined with the Multires modifier to subdivide the mesh), you can apply this displacement to make the new retopologized mesh exactly match the old one. (UV mapping is covered more thoroughly in <a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. UV Unwrapping">Chapter 8</a> and texture baking in <a class="xref" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Texture Baking">Chapter 10</a>, so I will only touch on the basics here.)</p><p>I created a simple UV unwrap for my retopologized mesh by tagging some seams (<span class="smaller">CTRL</span>-E) to split it into easy-to-unwrap patches.

Even a few subtle wrinkles can add a lot of character to a face.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Few faces are perfectly symmetrical. While sculpting with symmetry turned on will take you a long way, turn it off in the later stages of your sculpt to add a bit of uniqueness to the two sides of the face.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect1" title="In Review"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="in_review-id00012">In Review</h2></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we have looked at the variety of sculpting tools that Blender has to offer and how to customize them to make the most of their capabilities. Then, we moved on to sculpting the Bat Creature’s body and turning the simple base meshes I created both for it and for the Spider Bot project into more detailed, developed models that are now ready for retopology. Finally, we discussed some general principles for sculpting faces.</p><p>In the next chapter, we move on to retopologizing our sculpts, bringing the modeling stages of the projects to a close. In later chapters, we’ll use our high-poly sculpts again for baking maps and textures for our models before rendering them with displacement and normal maps to recapture the details we created in this chapter.</p></div></section></body></html>

			<p class="ChapterIntro">Bug bounty programs: are they all the same? Finding the right program to target is the first step to becoming a successful bug bounty hunter. Many programs have emerged within the past few years, and it’s difficult to figure out which ones will provide the best monetary rewards, experience, and learning opportunities.</p>
			<p>
				A <em>bug bounty program</em> is an initiative in which a company invites hackers to attack its products and service offerings. But how should you pick a program? And how should you prioritize their different metrics, such as the asset types involved, whether the program is hosted on a platform, whether it’s public or private, the program’s scope, the payout amounts, and response times?</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we’ll explore types of bug bounty programs, analyze the benefits and drawbacks of each, and figure out which one you should go for.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-123456c01-0001"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_4" title="4"/>The State of the Industry</h2>
			<p>Bug bounties are currently one of the most popular ways for organizations to receive feedback about security bugs. Large corporations, like PayPal and Facebook, as well as government agencies like the US Department of Defense, have all embraced the idea. Yet not too long ago, reporting a vulnerability to a company would have more likely landed you in jail than gotten you a reward.</p>
			<p>In 1995, Netscape launched the first-ever bug bounty program. The company encouraged users to report bugs found in its brand-new browser, the Netscape Navigator 2.0, introducing the idea of crowdsourced security testing to the internet world. Mozilla launched the next corporate bug bounty program nine years later, in 2004, inviting users to identify bugs in the Firefox browser.</p>
			<p>But it was not until the 2010s that offering bug bounties become a popular practice. That year, Google launched its program, and Facebook followed suit in 2011. These two programs kick-started the trend of using bug bounties to augment a corporation’s in-house security infrastructure.</p>
			<p>
				As bug bounties became a more well-known strategy, bug-bounty-as-a-service <em>platforms</em> emerged. These platforms help companies set up and operate their programs. For example, they provide a place for companies to host their programs, a way to process reward payments, and a centralized place to communicate with bug bounty hunters.</p>
			<p>
				The two largest of these platforms, HackerOne and Bugcrowd, both launched in 2012. After that, a few more platforms, such as Synack, Cobalt, and Intigriti, came to the market. These platforms and managed bug bounty services allow even companies with limited resources to run a security program. Today, large corporations, small startups, nonprofits, and government agencies alike have adopted bug bounties as an additional security measure and a fundamental piece of their security policies. You can read more about the history of bug bounty programs at <a class="LinkURL" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_bounty_program">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_bounty_program</a>.</p>
			<p>
				The term <em>security program</em> usually refers to information security policies, procedures, guidelines, and standards in the larger information security industry. In this book, I use <em>program</em> or <em>bug bounty program</em> to refer to a company’s bug bounty operations. Today, tons of programs exist, all with their unique characteristics, benefits, and drawbacks. Let’s examine these.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-123456c01-0002">Asset Types</h2>
			<p>
				In the context of a bug bounty program, an <em>asset</em> is an application, website, or product that you can hack. There are different types of assets, each with its own characteristics, requirements, and pros and cons. After considering these differences, you should choose a program with assets that play to your strengths, based on your skill set, experience level, and preferences.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-123456c01-0001"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_5" title="5"/>Social Sites and Applications</h3>
			<p>
				Anything labeled <em>social</em> has a lot of potential for vulnerabilities, because these applications tend to be complex and involve a lot of interaction among users, and between the user and the server. That’s why the first type of bug bounty program we’ll talk about targets social websites and applications. The term <em>social application</em> refers to any site that allows users to interact with each other. Many programs belong to this category: examples include the bug bounty program for HackerOne and programs for Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, and LINE.</p>
			<p>Social applications need to manage interactions among users, as well as each user’s roles, privileges, and account integrity. They are typically full of potential for critical web vulnerabilities such as insecure direct object references (IDORs), info leaks, and account takeovers. These vulnerabilities occur when many users are on a platform, and when applications mismanage user information; when the application does not validate a user’s identity properly, malicious users can assume the identity of others.</p>
			<p>These complex applications also often provide a lot of user input opportunities. If input validation is not performed properly, these applications are prone to injection bugs, like SQL injection (SQLi) or cross-site scripting (XSS).</p>
			<p>
				If you are a newcomer to bug bounties, I recommend that you start with social sites. The large number of social applications nowadays means that if you target social sites, you’ll have many programs to choose from. Also, the complex nature of social sites means that you’ll encounter a vast attack surface with which to experiment. (An application’s <em>attack surface</em> refers to all of the application’s different points that an attacker can attempt to exploit.) Finally, the diverse range of vulnerabilities that show up on these sites means that you will be able to quickly build a deep knowledge of web security.</p>
			<p>
				The skill set you need to hack social programs includes the ability to use a proxy, like the Burp Suite proxy introduced in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 4">Chapter 4</span>, and knowledge about web vulnerabilities such as XSS and IDOR. You can learn more about these in Chapters <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_6">6</span> and <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_10">10</span>. It’s also helpful to have some JavaScript programming skills and knowledge about web development. However, these skills aren’t required to succeed as a hacker.</p>
			<p>But these programs have a major downside. Because of the popularity of their products and the low barrier of entry, they’re often very competitive and have many hackers hunting on them. Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are some of the most targeted programs.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-123456c01-0002">General Web Applications</h3>
			<p><em>General </em><em>web applications</em> are also a good target for beginners. Here, I am referring to any web applications that do not involve user-to-user interaction. Instead, users interact with the server to access the application’s features. Targets that fall into these categories can include static websites, cloud applications, consumer services like banking sites, and web portals of Internet of Things (IoT) devices or other connected hardware. Like social sites, they <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_6" title="6"/>are also quite diverse and lend themselves well to a variety of skill levels. Examples include the programs for Google, the US Department of Defense, and Credit Karma.</p>
			<p>That said, in my experience, they tend to be a little more difficult to hack than social applications, and their attack surface is smaller. If you’re looking for account takeovers and info leak vulnerabilities, you won’t have as much luck because there aren’t a lot of opportunities for users to interact with others and potentially steal their information. The types of bugs that you’ll find in these applications are slightly different. You’ll need to look for server-side vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities specific to the application’s technology stack. You could also look for commonly found network vulnerabilities, like subdomain takeovers. This means you’ll have to know about both client-side and server-side web vulnerabilities, and you should have the ability to use a proxy. It’s also helpful to have some knowledge about web development and programming.</p>
			<p>These programs can range in popularity. However, most of them have a low barrier of entry, so you can most likely get started hacking right away!</p>
			<h3 id="h2-123456c01-0003">Mobile Applications (Android, iOS, and Windows)</h3>
			<p>
				After you get the hang of hacking web applications, you may choose to specialize in <em>mobile applications</em>. Mobile programs are becoming prevalent; after all, most web apps have a mobile equivalent nowadays. They include programs for Facebook Messenger, the Twitter app, the LINE mobile app, the Yelp app, and the Gmail app.</p>
			<p>Hacking mobile applications requires the skill set you’ve built from hacking web applications, as well as additional knowledge about the structure of mobile apps and programming techniques related to the platform. You should understand attacks and analysis strategies like certificate pinning bypass, mobile reverse engineering, and cryptography.</p>
			<p>
				Hacking mobile applications also requires a little more setup than hacking web applications, as you’ll need to own a mobile device that you can experiment on. A good mobile testing lab consists of a regular device, a rooted device, and device emulators for both Android and iOS. A <em>rooted</em> <em>device</em> is one for which you have admin privileges. It will allow you to experiment more freely, because you can bypass the mobile system’s safety constraints. An <em>emulator</em> is a virtual simulation of mobile environments that you run on your computer. It allows you to run multiple device versions and operating systems without owning a device for each setup.</p>
			<p>For these reasons, mobile applications are less popular among bug bounty hunters than web applications. However, the higher barrier of entry for mobile programs is an advantage for those who do participate. These programs are less competitive, making it relatively easy to find bugs.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-123456c01-0004">APIs</h3>
			<p><em>Application programming interfaces (</em><em>APIs</em><em>)</em> are specifications that define how other applications can interact with an organization’s assets, such as to retrieve or alter their data. For example, another application might be able <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_7" title="7"/>to retrieve an application’s data via HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) messages to a certain endpoint, and the application will return data in the format of Extensible Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) messages.</p>
			<p>Some programs put a heightened focus on API bugs in their bug bounty programs if they’re rolling out a new version of their API. A secure API implementation is key to preventing data breaches and protecting customer data. Hacking APIs requires many of the same skills as hacking web applications, mobile applications, and IoT applications. But when testing APIs, you should focus on common API bugs like data leaks and injection flaws.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-123456c01-0005">Source Code and Executables</h3>
			<p>
				If you have more advanced programming and reversing skills, you can give <em>source code</em> and <em>executable</em><em> programs</em> a try. These programs encourage hackers to find vulnerabilities in an organization’s software by directly providing hackers with an open source codebase or the binary executable. Examples include the Internet Bug Bounty, the program for the PHP language, and the WordPress program.</p>
			<p>Hacking these programs can entail analyzing the source code of open source projects for web vulnerabilities and fuzzing binaries for potential exploits. You usually have to understand coding and computer science concepts to be successful here. You’ll need knowledge of web vulnerabilities, programming skills related to the project’s codebase, and code analysis skills. Cryptography, software development, and reverse engineering skills are helpful.</p>
			<p>Source code programs may sound intimidating, but keep in mind that they’re diverse, so you have many to choose from. You don’t have to be a master programmer to hack these programs; rather, aim for a solid understanding of the project’s tech stack and underlying architecture. Because these programs tend to require more skills, they are less competitive, and only a small proportion of hackers will ever attempt them.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-123456c01-0006">Hardware and IoT</h3>
			<p>Last but not least are hardware and IoT programs. These programs ask you to hack devices like cars, smart televisions, and thermostats. Examples include the bug bounty programs of Tesla and Ford Motor Company.</p>
			<p>You’ll need highly specific skills to hack these programs: you’ll often have to acquire a deep familiarity with the type of device that you’re hacking, in addition to understanding common IoT vulnerabilities. You should know about web vulnerabilities, programming, code analysis, and reverse engineering. Also, study up on IoT concepts and industry standards such as digital signing and asymmetric encryption schemes. Finally, cryptography, wireless hacking, and software development skills will be helpful too.</p>
			<p>Although some programs will provide you with a free device to hack, that often applies to only the select hackers who’ve already established a relationship with the company. To begin hacking on these programs, you might need the funds to acquire the device on your own.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_8" title="8"/>Since these programs require specialized skills and a device, they tend to be the least competitive.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-123456c01-0003">Bug Bounty Platforms</h2>
			<p>Companies can host bug bounty programs in two ways: bug bounty platforms and independently hosted websites.</p>
			<p><em>Bug bounty platforms</em> are websites through which many companies host their programs. Usually, the platform directly awards hackers with reputation points and money for their results. Some of the largest bug bounty platforms are HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti, Synack, and Cobalt.</p>
			<p>Bug bounty platforms are an intermediary between hackers and security teams. They provide companies with logistical assistance for tasks like payment and communication. They also often offer help managing the incoming reports by filtering, deduplicating, and triaging bug reports for companies. Finally, these platforms provide a way for companies to gauge a hacker’s skill level via hacker statistics and reputation. This allows companies that do not wish to be inundated with low-quality reports to invite experienced hackers to their private programs. Some of these platforms also screen or interview hackers before allowing them to hack on programs.</p>
			<p>From the hacker’s perspective, bug bounty platforms provide a centralized place to submit reports. They also offer a seamless way to get recognized and paid for your findings.</p>
			<p>
				On the other hand, many organizations host and manage their bug bounty programs without the help of platforms. Companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, and Medium do this. You can find their bug bounty policy pages by visiting their websites, or by searching “<em>CompanyName</em> bug bounty program” online.</p>
			<p>As a bug bounty hunter, should you hack on a bug bounty platform? Or should you go for companies’ independently hosted programs?</p>
			<h3 id="h2-123456c01-0007">The Pros . . .</h3>
			<p>
				The best thing about bug bounty platforms is that they provide a lot of transparency into a company’s process, because they post disclosed reports, metrics about the programs’ triage rates, payout amounts, and response times. Independently hosted programs often lack this type of transparency. In the bug bounty world, <em>triage</em> refers to the confirmation of vulnerability.</p>
			<p>You also won’t have to worry about the logistics of emailing security teams, following up on reports, and providing payment and tax info every time you submit a vulnerability report. Bug bounty programs also often have reputation systems that allow you to showcase your experience so you can gain access to invite-only bug bounty programs.</p>
			<p>
				Another pro of bug bounty platforms is that they often step in to provide conflict resolution and legal protection as a third party. If you submit a report to a non-platform program, you have no recourse in the final bounty decision. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_9" title="9"/>Ultimately, you can’t always expect companies to pay up or resolve reports in the current state of the industry, but the hacker-to-hacker feedback system that platforms provide is helpful.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-123456c01-0008">. . . and the Cons</h3>
			<p>
				However, some hackers avoid bug bounty platforms because they dislike how those platforms deal with reports. Reports submitted to platform-managed bug bounty programs often get handled by <em>triagers</em>, third-party employees who often aren’t familiar with all the security details about a company’s product. Complaints about triagers handling reports improperly are common.</p>
			<p>Programs on platforms also break the direct connection between hackers and developers. With a direct program, you often get to discuss the vulnerability with a company’s security engineers, making for a great learning experience.</p>
			<p>Finally, public programs on bug bounty platforms are often crowded, because the platform gives them extra exposure. On the other hand, many privately hosted programs don’t get as much attention from hackers and are thus less competitive. And for the many companies that do not contract with bug bounty platforms, you have no choice but to go off platforms if you want to participate in their programs.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-123456c01-0004">Scope, Payouts, and Response Times</h2>
			<p>What other metrics should you consider when picking a program, besides its asset types and platform? On each bug bounty program’s page, metrics are often listed to help you assess the program. These metrics give insight into how easily you might be able to find bugs, how much you might get paid, and how well the program operates.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-123456c01-0009">Program Scope</h3>
			<p>
				First, consider the scope. A program’s <em>scope</em> on its policy pages specifies what and how you are allowed to hack. There are two types of scopes: asset and vulnerability. The <em>asset scope</em> tells you which subdomain, products, and applications you can hack. And the <em>vulnerability scope</em> specifies which vulnerabilities the company will accept as valid bugs.</p>
			<p>For example, the company might list the subdomains of its website that are in and out of scope:</p>
			<p class="ListHead"><b>In-scope assets</b></p>
			<ol class="none">
				<li><em>a.example.com</em></li>
				<li><em>b.example.com</em></li>
				<li><em>c.example.com</em></li>
				<li><em>users.example.com</em></li>
				<li><em>landing.example.com</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="ListHead"><b>Out-of-scope assets</b></p>
			<ol class="none">
				<li><em>dev.example.com</em></li>
				<li><em>test.example.com</em></li>
			</ol>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_10" title="10"/>Assets that are listed as in scope are the ones that you are allowed to hack. On the other hand, assets that are listed as out of scope are off-limits to bug bounty hunters. Be extra careful and abide by the rules! Hacking an out-of-scope asset is illegal.</p>
			<p>The company will also often list the vulnerabilities it considers valid bugs:</p>
			<p class="ListHead"><b>In-scope vulnerabilities</b></p>
			<ol class="none">
				<li>All except the ones listed as out of scope</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="ListHead"><b>Out-of-scope vulnerabilities</b></p>
			<ol class="none">
				<li>Self-XSS</li>
				<li>Clickjacking</li>
				<li>Missing HTTP headers and other best practices without direct security impact</li>
				<li>Denial-of-service attacks</li>
				<li>Use of known-vulnerable libraries, without proof of exploitability</li>
				<li>Results of automated scanners, without proof of exploitability</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The out-of-scope vulnerabilities that you see in this example are typical of what you would find in bug bounty programs. Notice that many programs consider non-exploitable issues, like violations of best practice, to be out of scope.</p>
			<p>Any program with large asset and vulnerability scopes is a good place to start for a beginner. The larger the asset scope, the larger the number of target applications and web pages you can look at. When a program has a big asset scope, you can often find obscure applications that are overlooked by other hackers. This typically means less competition when reporting bugs.</p>
			<p>The larger the vulnerability scope, the more types of bugs the organization is willing to hear reports about. These programs are a lot easier to find bugs in, because you have more opportunities, and so can play to your strengths.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-123456c01-0010">Payout Amounts</h3>
			<p>
				The next metric you should consider is the program’s <em>payout amounts</em>. There are two types of payment programs: <em>vulnerability disclosure programs</em> <em>(VDPs)</em> and <em>bug bounty programs</em>.</p>
			<p>
				VDPs are <em>reputation-only programs</em>, meaning they do not pay for findings but often offer rewards such as reputation points and swag. They are a great way to learn about hacking if making money is not your primary objective. Since they don’t pay, they’re less competitive, and so easier to find bugs in. You can use them to practice finding common vulnerabilities and communicating with security engineers.</p>
			<p>
				On the other hand, bug bounty programs offer varying amounts of monetary rewards for your findings. In general, the more severe the vulnerability, the more the report will pay. But different programs have different payout averages for each level of severity. You can find a program’s payout information on its bug bounty pages, usually listed in a section called the <em>payout </em><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_11" title="11"/>table. Typically, low-impact issues will pay anywhere from $50 to $500 (USD), while critical issues can pay upward of $10,000. However, the bug bounty industry is evolving, and payout amounts are increasing for high-impact bugs. For example, Apple now rewards up to $1 million for the most severe vulnerabilities.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-123456c01-0011">Response Time</h3>
			<p>
				Finally, consider the program’s average <em>response time</em>. Some companies will handle and resolve your reports within a few days, while others take weeks or even months to finalize their fixes. Delays often happen because of the security team’s internal constraints, like a lack of personnel to handle reports, a delay in issuing security patches, and a lack of funds to timely reward researchers. Sometimes, delays happen because researchers have sent bad reports without clear reproduction steps.</p>
			<p>Prioritize programs with fast response times. Waiting for responses from companies can be a frustrating experience, and when you first start, you’re going to make a lot of mistakes. You might misjudge the severity of a bug, write an unclear explanation, or make technical mistakes in the report. Rapid feedback from security teams will help you improve, and turn you into a competent hacker faster.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-123456c01-0005">Private Programs</h2>
			<p>Most bug bounty platforms distinguish between public and private programs.</p>
			<p><em>Public programs</em> are those that are open to all; anyone can hack and submit bugs to these programs, as long as they abide by the laws and the bug bounty program’s policies.</p>
			<p>
				On the other hand, <em>private programs</em> are open to only invited hackers. For these, companies ask hackers with a certain level of experience and a proven track record to attack the company and submit bugs to it. Private programs are a lot less competitive than public ones because of the limited number of hackers participating. Therefore, it’s much easier to find bugs in them. Private programs also often have a much faster response time, because they receive fewer reports on average.</p>
			<p>
				Participating in private programs can be extremely advantageous. But how do you get invited to one? <a href="#figure1-1" id="figureanchor1-1">Figure 1-1</a> shows a private invitation notification on the HackerOne platform.</p>
			<figure>
				<img alt="f01001" class="keyline" src="image_fi/501546c01/f01001.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p><a id="figure1-1">Figure 1-1</a>: A private invitation notification on the HackerOne platform. When you hack on a bug bounty platform, you can often get invites to the private programs of different companies.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Companies send private invites to hackers who have proven their abilities in some way, so getting invites to private programs isn’t difficult once <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_12" title="12"/>you’ve found a couple of bugs. Different bug bounty platforms will have different algorithms to determine who gets the invites, but here are some tips to help you get there.</p>
			<p>
				First, submit a few bugs to public programs. To get private invites, you often need to gain a certain number of reputation points on a platform, and the only way to begin earning these is to submit valid bugs to public programs. You should also focus on submitting high-impact vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities will often reward you with higher reputation points and help you get private invites faster. In each of the chapters in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Part II">Part II</span> of this book, I make suggestions for how you can escalate the issues you discover to craft the highest-impact attacks. On some bug bounty platforms, like HackerOne, you can also get private invites by completing tutorials or solving Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges.</p>
			<p>Next, don’t spam. Submitting nonissues often causes a decrease in reputation points. Most bug bounty platforms limit private invites to hackers with points above a certain threshold.</p>
			<p>Finally, be polite and courteous when communicating with security teams. Being rude or abusive to security teams will probably get you banned from the program and prevent you from getting private invites from other companies.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-123456c01-0006">Choosing the Right Program</h2>
			<p>Bug bounties are a great way to gain experience in cybersecurity and earn extra bucks. But the industry has been getting more competitive. As more people are discovering these programs and getting involved in hacking on them, it’s becoming increasingly difficult for beginners to get started. That’s why it’s important to pick a program that you can succeed in from the very start.</p>
			<p>Before you develop a bug hunter’s intuition, you often have to rely on low-hanging fruit and well-known techniques. This means many other hackers will be able to find the same bugs, often much faster than you can. It’s therefore a good idea to pick a program that more experienced bug hunters pass over to avoid competition. You can find these underpopulated programs in two ways: look for unpaid programs or go for programs with big scopes.</p>
			<p>Try going for vulnerability disclosure programs first. Unpaid programs are often ignored by experienced bug hunters, since they don’t pay monetary rewards. But they still earn you points and recognition! And that recognition might be just what you need to get an invite to a private, paid program.</p>
			<p>Picking a program with a large scope means you’ll be able to look at a larger number of target applications and web pages. This dilutes the competition, as fewer hackers will report on any single asset or vulnerability type. Go for programs with fast response times to prevent frustration and get feedback as soon as possible.</p>
			<p>
				One last thing that you can incorporate into your decision process is the reputation of the program. If you can, gather information about a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_13" title="13"/>company’s process through its disclosed reports and learn from other hackers’ experiences. Does the company treat its reporters well? Are they respectful and supportive? Do they help you learn? Pick programs that will be supportive while you are still learning, and programs that will reward you for the value that you provide.</p>
			<p>Choosing the right program for your skill set is crucial if you want to break into the world of bug bounties. This chapter should have helped you sort out the various programs that you might be interested in. Happy hacking!</p>

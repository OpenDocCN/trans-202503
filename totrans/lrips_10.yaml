- en: Probability was a little town on the edge of the sea. It was surrounded only
    by a rough wooden fence, nothing like the high stone walls of Symbol, and the
    main entrance seemed to be unguarded. Laurie was walking through the gates, when—

- en: “Excuse me, dear! Hello, on your left.” An elderly lady was sitting in the shade
    just inside. She held a large book on her lap. Her name tag read *Jane Hecate,
    Border Security*.

  prefs: []

    on the List.”

    is—”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Hold on, dear, hold on! One thing at a time. First let’s look up your name.”
    She opened the heavy book and started to scan the pages with her finger, letter
    by letter.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “You’re not on the List, dear. There are Es, and E-Ps, but there are no names
    that start with E-P-O. If the *start* of your name isn’t on the List, there’s
    no reason to keep looking for the *rest* of it, now is there? It’s only logical.”
  prefs: []

    sputtered.

    from. That can happen, especially with foreigners. Why don’t we try again?”

    . Nope. Not here, but I’m sure we’ll find it.”

    different ways, isn’t it?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    try every word in the dictionary. But we’ll be here all month!”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “I have an idea,” Xor whispered back. “Try ‘Abstraction.’”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “So? It’s not the password,” Xor said.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “But when I said ‘Algorithm,’ she took longer to say no. And with Abstraction,
    she took a little longer than that, moving her finger over the page . . .” Laurie
    cleared her throat and spoke to Jane. “Is the password, um, About?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Okay, but what does it mean?”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: “Maybe it means the real password starts with AB! So if we keep guessing AB
    words . . .”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Letter by letter they cracked Rustic’s password. It was difficult for Laurie
    to think of words that started with the right letters. She did not know many of
    the words Xor told her to try, but he swore they were real, on the honor of Thesauruses
    everywhere. She knew they were getting warmer because Jane would take longer and
    longer to say no.

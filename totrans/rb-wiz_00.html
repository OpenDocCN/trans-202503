    </div>&#13;
&#13;
    <p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1397"/>You found this book! Okay, awesome. I was really hoping it would get to you.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>Imagine someone tells you he’s discovered a new way of writing. Not a new language, like French or Japanese or Elvish, but a whole new <span class="emphasis"><em>kind</em></span> of writing that makes your stories <span class="emphasis"><em>actually happen</em></span>. If you described a maze, people could enter—and get lost in—that maze. If you wrote about a faraway planet where robot pirates fought ninja wizards, that planet would totally exist. Not only that, but you could write dialogue like <code class="literal">"Beep boop shiver me circuits"</code> or cast spells like <code class="literal">ninja_wizard.throw_flaming_ninja_stars</code>. Crazy, right? And that’s probably exactly what you’d say: that this is completely crazy and whoever thought of it has too much time on his hands. Too much imagination.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <div class="informalfigure">&#13;
      <a id="med_id00002a"/>&#13;
&#13;
      <div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00002"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="../Images/httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages2159959.png.jpg"/></div>&#13;
    </div>&#13;
&#13;
    <p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1744"/>Well, it turns out there’s no such thing as too much imagination. So! Imagine me this: not only is this crazy new way of writing <span class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span>, but you can learn how to do it. You could, with a little practice, figure out how to make your own worlds with your own rules. You’d be in charge, and you could do pretty much anything you could think of. Not only that, but if you got really good at it, people would come from all over to experience the worlds you built and use all the amazing things you created.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>You can stop imagining (for now, at least). I’m telling you that this is true! And this book can help you do it. The pages you now hold in your hands are a guide to a <span class="emphasis"><em>programming language</em></span> called <span class="emphasis"><em>Ruby</em></span> that will let you do all these things, and all you need is your brain, a computer, and Ruby.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <p><span class="emphasis"><em>How can this be?</em></span> you might be thinking. <span class="emphasis"><em>If something this cool and powerful existed, I definitely would have heard about it by now.</em></span></p>&#13;
&#13;
    <p>Which brings us to our next topic.</p>&#13;
&#13;
    <div class="sect1" title="Why Learn Programming (and Why Ruby)?">&#13;
      <div class="titlepage">&#13;
        <h1 class="title" id="heading_id_3"><a id="why_learn_programming_left_parenthesisan"/>Why Learn Programming (and Why Ruby)?</h1>&#13;
      </div>&#13;
&#13;
      <p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1756"/>Learning to program sounded boring to me when I was younger. I thought programming and computers were all about math and logic—that there was no room to be creative or do anything interesting. All day long, people told me what to do: go to school, walk the dog, go to the dentist, do my homework. I figured programming would be more of the same, so I avoided it completely. Instead, I wrote stories about space travel, magic, and distant worlds where not only did amazing things happen, but I was in charge! I still write stories all the time, but even the best stories end when the reader turns the last page. As much as you want starships or ninja wizards to be real, writing stories about them doesn’t make that happen. So I did write a lot of stories, but I also had to go to the dentist.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>Then something very strange happened: I decided to give programming a try. I discovered that this thing I thought would be terribly dry and boring was exactly the opposite—it was challenging and fun. Suddenly, I was calling the shots! If I told the computer to make a puzzle game, it made a puzzle game. If I told it to make a website, it made a website. It made real things in the world that I could see, play with, and use. It was as if all the stories I had been writing for years could now come to life, and all it took was this little box and a language I could use to talk to it.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>It’s true that some programming languages are hard, and some are downright confusing. Ruby is different: it was designed to make you happy—to be easy for <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> to read and understand, not just the computer. Ruby was built to help you tell stories that computers and human beings can both enjoy, and so instead of weird symbols or words like <code class="literal">static</code> and <code class="literal">void</code>, you get programs that look almost like English, with words like <code class="literal">unless</code>, <code class="literal">rescue</code>, <code class="literal">self</code>, and even <code class="literal">begin</code> and <code class="literal">end</code>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>Just as with any programming language, learning Ruby will help you learn important skills, make cool things, and feel <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1250"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1423"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1684"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1751"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1868"/>accomplished. But mostly, you’ll just have <span class="emphasis"><em>fun</em></span>. And among programming languages, I think Ruby is the most fun.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>Let’s say you wanted to program the computer to say “Howdy!” If you wanted to do this in another language—for instance, Java—you might have to write something really complicated, like this:</p><a id="pro_id00002"/>&#13;
      <pre class="programlisting">&#13;
class Howdy {&#13;
  public static void main (String[] args) {&#13;
    System.out.println("Howdy!");&#13;
  }&#13;
}&#13;
</pre>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>That’s a lot of code to print one word. To do the same thing in Ruby, you just type:</p><a id="pro_id00003"/>&#13;
      <pre class="programlisting">&#13;
puts "Howdy!"&#13;
</pre>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>That’s it! Ruby puts the word right there on the screen. Simple, right? Ruby is all about making you a happy and productive programmer (oh yeah—you’re a programmer now), so it gets rid of a lot of complicated <span class="emphasis"><em>syntax</em></span> (like <code class="literal">{</code> and <code class="literal">;</code>) and lets you avoid writing boring things like <code class="literal">public static void main</code> all over the place. And since Ruby can do pretty much all the stuff that trickier languages like Java can do, you’ll be able to build amazing things faster and with less effort.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>Let’s get started!</p>&#13;

      </div>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>All right—this is the part where you might want to grab your mom, dad, grandpa, grandma, aunt, uncle, teacher, or another local adult to help you install Ruby on your computer. Ruby is free, but you’ll need an Internet connection to download it if you don’t already have it.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>The directions are a little different depending on which kind of computer you have, so ask your adult if you’re not sure!</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>If you’re running Windows, skip ahead to <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch01.html#installing_on_windows" title="Installing on Windows">Installing on Windows</a>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <div class="sect2" title="Installing on Mac or Linux">&#13;
        <div class="titlepage">&#13;
          <h2 class="title" id="heading_id_5"><a id="installing_on_mac_or_linux"/>Installing on Mac or Linux</h2>&#13;
        </div>&#13;
&#13;
        <p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1203"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1424"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1482"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1508"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1747"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1872"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1942"/>First, let’s check to see if you already have Ruby installed. If you’re on a Mac or a computer running Linux, you can check to see which version of Ruby you have on the <span class="emphasis"><em>command line</em></span>—this is where you’ll be typing your Ruby programs.</p>&#13;
&#13;
        <p>The command line is probably very different from the way you usually use your computer (clicking icons and moving things with your mouse), but once you get used to it, the command line can be much faster and easier.</p>&#13;
&#13;
        <p>On a Mac or Linux computer, your command line is in an application called <span class="emphasis"><em>Terminal</em></span>. Find your Terminal application and open it. You should see something like this:</p>&#13;
&#13;
        <div class="informalfigure">&#13;
          <a id="med_id00003a"/>&#13;
&#13;
          <div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00003"/><img alt="image with no caption" src="../Images/httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages2159961.png.jpg"/></div>&#13;
        </div>&#13;
&#13;
        <p>Once you’ve got the Terminal open, go ahead and type the following line (you don’t need to type the dollar sign—just the <code class="literal">ruby -v</code> bit) and press <span class="smaller">ENTER</span>:</p><a id="pro_id00004"/>&#13;
        <pre class="programlisting">&#13;
$ <span class="strong"><strong><span class="red">ruby -v</span></strong></span>&#13;
</pre>&#13;
&#13;
        <p>If Ruby is installed, you’ll get back something like this:</p><a id="pro_id00005"/>&#13;
        <pre class="programlisting">&#13;
ruby 2.0.0p247&#13;
</pre>&#13;
&#13;
        <p>If you get this response and it includes <code class="literal">2.0.0</code>, you’re all set! Skip ahead to <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch01.html#achievement_unlocked_ruby_installedexcla" title="Achievement Unlocked: Ruby Installed!">Achievement Unlocked: Ruby Installed!</a>. If you get a number other than <code class="literal">2.0.0</code> (for instance, <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1180"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1205"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1296"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1426"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1739"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1748"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1943"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1968"/><code class="literal">1.9.3</code> or <code class="literal">1.8.7</code>), we’ll need to get you on version 2.0.0 (the version this book uses). If your computer is super fancy, you might already be on Ruby 2.1—the code in this book should work in Ruby 2.1, too. For maximum awesomeness and minimal errors, you should run all the examples using Ruby 2.0.0.</p>&#13;
&#13;
        <p>If your computer says something like this:</p><a id="pro_id00006"/>&#13;
        <pre class="programlisting">&#13;
-bash: ruby: command not found&#13;
</pre>&#13;
&#13;
        <p>then you don’t have Ruby. No worries. Grab an adult and skip to <a class="xref" href="../Text/apa.html" title="Appendix A. Installing Ruby on Mac and Linux">Appendix A</a> for detailed step-by-step instructions. We’ll install it there! Come back to this chapter when you’re done.</p>&#13;

&#13;
        <p>If you’re on a PC running Windows, you can check if Ruby is installed by opening the <span class="emphasis"><em>command prompt</em></span>. We’ll be using Windows 7 in this example. You can open the command prompt from the Start menu or by searching for <span class="emphasis"><em>cmd.exe</em></span>; once you find it, double-click it to open the application. You should see something like this:</p>&#13;

        </div>&#13;
&#13;
        <p>Your command prompt—the little bit before the <code class="literal">&gt;</code>—will probably be different from mine, but that’s okay! Type <span class="strong"><strong><span class="red"><code class="literal">ruby -v</code></span></strong></span> and then press <span class="smaller">ENTER</span>:</p><a id="pro_id00007"/>&#13;
        <pre class="programlisting">&#13;
&gt; <span class="strong"><strong><span class="red">ruby -v</span></strong></span>&#13;
</pre>&#13;
&#13;
        <p>If you get a response that includes <code class="literal">2.0.0</code>, you’re all set! If you see a Ruby version other than 2.0.0, or if you get this error:</p><a id="pro_id00008"/>&#13;
        <pre class="programlisting">&#13;
'ruby' is not recognized as an internal or external command,&#13;
operable program or batch file.&#13;
</pre>&#13;
&#13;
        <p>then we’ll need to go ahead and install Ruby. Let’s get to it!</p>&#13;

(Don’t worry if the number after the <span class="emphasis"><em>p</em></span> on the installation website is a little higher than what’s shown here; that just means that version is very slightly newer, but it’s still Ruby 2.0 and should work great.) Once the download is finished, go to the folder where you saved the <span class="emphasis"><em>.exe</em></span> file and double-click it to run the installer.

              <li class="listitem">&#13;
                <p>The installer will ask you where you’d like to install Ruby, defaulting to <code class="literal">C:\Ruby200</code>. This is great! You’ll also see a checkbox that says “Add Ruby executables to your PATH.” Make sure that box is checked, then click <span class="strong"><strong>Install</strong></span>.</p>&#13;
              </li>&#13;
&#13;
              <li class="listitem">&#13;

      <p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1191"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1754"/>Perfect! Now that you’ve got Ruby installed, we can start learning our way around. In the next chapter, we’ll cover some Ruby basics and learn how to use Ruby interactively, meaning you’ll get to see Ruby run your code just by pressing the <span class="smaller">ENTER</span> key. In the chapters that follow, you’ll learn the ins and outs of the Ruby language through a series of stories. Since Ruby programs are, after all, just stories you write for the computer to understand, and Ruby is all about writing code that’s nice for people and computers to read, I figure it only makes sense to use stories to show you how it all works. They’re pretty good stories, I think.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>You might be tempted to just read the code in this book and say to yourself, “Yup, this makes sense! I don’t need to run the code.” I thought that was true when I started programming, but boy, was I wrong. The only way to learn how to write code is, well, to write code, and you’re cheating yourself out of a lot of really cool knowledge if you only read these examples and never run a line of Ruby.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>One more word of advice before we set out on our adventure: you might have to read something more than once or run a piece of code a few times to really get it. That’s okay! Learning to program isn’t just a new way of writing—it’s a new way of thinking, too. It might be a little hard sometimes, but I promise that if you stick with it, you’ll get it. Believe me, there are people way less smart and enthusiastic than you who have learned how to program, and if they can do it, so can you.</p>&#13;

&#13;
      <p>Okay, so you’ve got your very own copy of Ruby, and you know that Ruby is a language you can use to tell computers to do anything you want. But you’re probably overflowing with questions: Where did Ruby come from? Who created it and why? What amazing things have been created with it? What <span class="emphasis"><em>good</em></span> is Ruby? <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1437"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1513"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1750"/>Well, question no more: I’ll give you all those answers (plus a few bonus ones).</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>While computers were invented about a bajillion years ago (the first devices you’d recognize as computers were created in the 1940s), Ruby was cooked up relatively recently, in 1993. You might think that 1993 was a bajillion years ago, too, and in some ways, you’re right. The Internet only had about a hundred websites. Nobody had smartphones. In fact, most people’s phones were <span class="emphasis"><em>connected to their walls by wires</em></span>. These were dark times.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>But in the ancient world of the mid-1990s, a man named Yukihiro Matsumoto (or just “Matz” to his friends) was busy trying to invent the future. He was frustrated by programming languages that were designed to make life easy for computers but were hard for people to understand, read, remember, and use. Why wasn’t there a language that was built to be easy for <span class="emphasis"><em>people</em></span> to use, a language that was clear, simple—and even fun?</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>Matz realized that his ideal programming language didn’t exist, so he created it. “I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy,” Matz has said. “That is the primary purpose of the Ruby language.”<sup>[<a class="footnote" href="#ftn.ch01fn01" id="ch01fn01">1</a>]</sup> And that’s Ruby in a nutshell: a <span class="emphasis"><em>fun</em></span> way for you to create games, websites, or anything you can imagine with just your brain and a computer. Matz has had such a positive influence on the language he created that Ruby programmers have a saying: “Matz is nice, so we are nice,” or MINSWAN. Remember MINSWAN when you’re learning Ruby and especially when you’re teaching it to others!</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>Which reminds me: there are a lot of amazing things you can create with Ruby. Over the last few years, Ruby has been used to build major websites like Twitter and Hulu, iPhone apps, and even NASA simulations. That’s right: you can use Ruby to explore space! People are using Ruby for more and more projects every day, and with all the cool new tools and ideas constantly coming from the Ruby community, your imagination’s really the only limit when it comes to building your own programs.</p>&#13;

&#13;
      <p>Your website is up, your game is working, your starship is shooting lasers at a witch queen. But how do you run these Ruby scripts? For that, we’ll need to learn about the <code class="literal">ruby</code> command and a little program called <span class="emphasis"><em>IRB</em></span>.</p>&#13;

&#13;
      <p>If you’re using Mac or Linux, open the terminal and type:</p><a id="pro_id00010"/>&#13;
      <pre class="programlisting">&#13;
$ <span class="strong"><strong><span class="red">irb</span></strong></span>&#13;
</pre>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>You only need to type <span class="strong"><strong><span class="red"><code class="literal">irb</code></span></strong></span>, not the dollar sign; the dollar sign is my way of showing you that you should type something in the terminal.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>If you’re using Windows, you can run IRB from the Start menu.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1055"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1307"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1597"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1677"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1686"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1698"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1782"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1876"/>Once you have IRB open, you should see something like this:</p><a id="pro_id00011"/>&#13;
      <pre class="programlisting">&#13;
2.0.0p247 :001 &gt;&#13;
</pre>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>That’s IRB’s <span class="emphasis"><em>prompt</em></span>, which is IRB’s way of telling you it’s ready for you to type something. It might look a bit different to you depending on your Ruby version, but it should end with a <code class="literal">&gt;</code>.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>In this book, we’ll simplify that to look like this:</p><a id="pro_id00012"/>&#13;
      <pre class="programlisting">&#13;
&gt;&gt;&#13;
</pre>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>Whenever you see <code class="literal">&gt;&gt;</code>, we’ll be using IRB. If you type this after the <code class="literal">&gt;&gt;</code> (don’t forget the quotation marks—they’re very important!):</p><a id="pro_id00013"/>&#13;
      <pre class="programlisting">&#13;
&gt;&gt; <span class="strong"><strong><span class="red">puts "Ruby is awesome!"</span></strong></span>&#13;
</pre>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>when you press <span class="smaller">ENTER</span>, you should see Ruby print out:</p><a id="pro_id00014"/>&#13;
      <pre class="programlisting">&#13;
Ruby is awesome!&#13;
=&gt; nil&#13;
</pre>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>Excellent! We’ve written a simple program to print some text to the screen. You’ll also see Ruby say something about “nil.” Don’t worry about this just yet; I’ll explain that part in a little while. (If you can’t wait: basically, this is Ruby telling you that it’s all done printing and has nothing else to give you. You’ll learn all about <code class="literal">nil</code> in <a class="xref" href="../Text/ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. The Magic of Methods and Blocks">Chapter 7</a>.) The cool thing is, you’ve just written your very first Ruby program!</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>IRB will continue to prompt you and wait for you to type things until you tell it to stop, which you can do at any time by typing <code class="literal">exit</code> (or just quitting your terminal program).</p>&#13;

&#13;
      <p>The other way of writing Ruby commands is as a script, which is just writing many lines and then running them all at once, instead of one at a time.

(This is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> something like Microsoft Word, which is a <span class="emphasis"><em>word processor</em></span>; a word processor is great for writing stories or reports for school, but it’s terrible for writing programs.)</p>&#13;

        <p>All Macs come with a text editor called TextEdit (you can find it in your <span class="emphasis"><em>Applications</em></span> folder).

Then, open your terminal and change into the folder where you saved <span class="emphasis"><em>awesome.rb</em></span>. Here’s how to do that with the <code class="literal">cd</code> command:</p>&#13;

              <p>Don’t type the <code class="literal">$</code> part, just everything after it. Also, don’t literally type <span class="emphasis"><em><code class="literal">username</code></em></span>; you should replace that with whatever you see in your prompt! (Mine is <code class="literal">/Users/eweinstein/</code>, but yours will be different.)</p>&#13;
            </li>&#13;
&#13;
            <li class="listitem">&#13;
              <p>On Windows, your prompt (the bit to the left of the <code class="literal">&gt;</code> on the command line) looks something like <code class="literal">C:\Users\</code><span class="emphasis"><em><code class="literal">username</code></em></span>. If you saved <span class="emphasis"><em>awesome.rb</em></span> in a folder called <span class="emphasis"><em>ruby</em></span> in your home folder, you can get to that folder on the command line by entering:</p><a id="pro_id00017"/>&#13;

      </div>&#13;
&#13;
      <p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1189"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1452"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1576"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1736"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1786"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1877"/>So if we type the same thing into IRB and into our script file, and we get the same output, what’s the difference between the two? Basically, IRB will let you try out only one line of code at a time; every time you press the <span class="smaller">ENTER</span> key, IRB will read, or <span class="emphasis"><em>evaluate</em></span>, the code you wrote and spit out an answer. It’s a great way to try things out and see if they work.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>This means that every time you press <span class="smaller">ENTER</span>, Ruby will interrupt you with the result of calculating each line, like this:</p><a id="pro_id00020"/>&#13;
      <pre class="programlisting">&#13;
&gt;&gt; <span class="strong"><strong><span class="red">2 + 5</span></strong></span>&#13;
=&gt; 7&#13;
&gt;&gt; <span class="strong"><strong><span class="red">24 * 10</span></strong></span>&#13;
=&gt; 240&#13;
&gt;&gt; <span class="strong"><strong><span class="red">'Hi ' + 'there!'</span></strong></span>&#13;
=&gt; "Hi there!"&#13;
</pre>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>The code in bold is what you’ve typed; below it is the response you get from IRB when you press <span class="smaller">ENTER</span>. We don’t always need all that noise! Sometimes we just want to know the final result of all our work. To do that, we can write this same code as a script. Just open your editor from earlier (for example, TextEdit if you’re on a Mac, Gedit if you’re using Linux, or Notepad++ for a PC running Windows) and type the following:</p><a id="pro_id00021"/>&#13;
      <pre class="programlisting">&#13;
<span class="strong"><strong><span class="red">puts 2 + 5</span></strong></span>&#13;
<span class="strong"><strong><span class="red">puts 24 * 10</span></strong></span>&#13;
<span class="strong"><strong><span class="red">puts 'Hi ' + 'there!'</span></strong></span>&#13;
</pre>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>Then save the script as <span class="bolditalic red">script_example.rb</span>, or any name you like with a <span class="emphasis"><em>.rb</em></span> at the end (but no spaces allowed!), use <code class="literal">cd</code> to switch into the directory where you saved the script, and finally run the script with the <code class="literal">ruby</code> command:</p><a id="pro_id00022"/>&#13;
      <pre class="programlisting">&#13;
$ <span class="strong"><strong><span class="red">ruby script_example.rb</span></strong></span>&#13;
</pre>&#13;
&#13;
      <p><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1035"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1043"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1381"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1676"/>This way, we’ll just get the printed-out information we want, without having to type line by line:</p><a id="pro_id00023"/>&#13;
      <pre class="programlisting">&#13;
7&#13;
240&#13;
Hi there!&#13;
</pre>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>Not only is this easier to read, but we can now run the script over and over with <span class="strong"><strong><span class="red"><code class="literal">ruby script_example.rb</code></span></strong></span> and do our calculations without retyping all the commands each time. We can save our program forever, change it, and build on it later.</p>&#13;

    <div class="sect1" title="The Prompts Used in This Book">&#13;

      </div>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>Throughout the book, we’ll alternate between using IRB for small bits of code and running scripts for longer ones. Whenever you see the IRB prompt, which looks like this:</p><a id="pro_id00024"/>&#13;
      <pre class="programlisting">&#13;
&gt;&gt;&#13;
</pre>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>that means you should be running the code using IRB; when you don’t see it, it means you should type the script in your text editor and run it using the <code class="literal">ruby</code> command. Here’s what an IRB example looks like:</p><a id="pro_id00025"/>&#13;
      <pre class="programlisting">&#13;
&gt;&gt; <span class="strong"><strong><span class="red">2 + 2</span></strong></span>&#13;
=&gt; 4&#13;
</pre>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>Let’s take a moment to talk about what each piece of this code does. The <code class="literal">&gt;&gt;</code> bit says, “We’re in IRB, which is a program that understands Ruby commands.” Remember, you don’t want to type <code class="literal">&gt;&gt;</code>; this just lets you know we’re using IRB. The <code class="literal">&gt;&gt;</code> in the book represents the IRB prompt on your own computer.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>The bold code that reads <span class="strong"><strong><span class="red"><code class="literal">2 + 2</code></span></strong></span> is a command for you to enter—type these lines exactly, then press <span class="smaller">ENTER</span>. When you see several bold lines at an IRB prompt, just type them one at a time, pressing <span class="smaller">ENTER</span> after each line.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>But the second line in this code begins with <code class="literal">=&gt;</code>. This is what IRB spits back out in response after you press <span class="smaller">ENTER</span>. (That <a class="indexterm" id="iddle1207"/><a class="indexterm" id="iddle1209"/>means you don’t have to type these bits either.) If you get an error after typing a command instead of seeing the result shown in the book, make sure you’ve typed your Ruby commands <span class="emphasis"><em>exactly</em></span>. Computers are very dumb: they do exactly what you <span class="emphasis"><em>say</em></span> and not always what you <span class="emphasis"><em>want</em></span>!</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>Other programs in the book are longer, so you’ll want to be able to change or improve them and fix mistakes. That means you’ll want to write them with a text editor. I’ll remind you of what to use for each example as we go. But remember, when you don’t see IRB’s <code class="literal">&gt;&gt;</code>, you’ll want to use a text editor.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>Once we jump into the story, you’ll hear about <span class="emphasis"><em>Computing Contraptions</em></span>. These are imaginary versions of computers just like yours, and whenever you see characters in the story running Ruby on a Computing Contraption, they’re really just giving IRB and Ruby a spin, so you can follow along yourself at home.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>Finally, some of the scripts later in the book get pretty long. I’ll break those up into multiple sections and narrate each one. You’ll see numbered balls that look like this:</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>➊ ➋ ➌ ➍ ➎</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>I’ll refer to those numbers in the text so you can walk through each of the examples step-by-step. You don’t type these into the computer; they’re just for reference!</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>Again, don’t worry if you forget the differences between the IRB and Ruby script prompts—I’ll remind you as we go along!</p>&#13;

&#13;
      <p>Don’t worry about understanding all the code you just saw in these examples. We’ve only just started learning Ruby, and I promise we’ll go through all of its secrets over the course of the next few chapters. We’ll cover how to handle text and numbers, how to help our programs make decisions based on information they get from the people using them, how to create our own Ruby commands, how to write scripts that will connect to websites on the Internet, and much more.</p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>I said earlier that writing Ruby is more like writing stories than writing instructions for a machine, so I’ll be using stories to teach you how Ruby works. In the pages that follow, I’ll introduce you to a few characters who will help explain everything you’d ever want to know about Ruby. Some will be expert Ruby programmers, and some, like you, will be brand new to the language. Many will have all sorts of problems that they think can’t be solved, but with a bit of hard work and some Ruby magic, they’ll find out that their troubles aren’t nearly as bad as they seem. Speaking of magic, there’ll be a bit of that, too—a king, a queen, a castle, an enchanted (possibly slightly haunted) forest, a wandering minstrel, some witches and wizards, a dragon or two, and a couple of kids a lot like you who have wandered into this crazy kingdom and have no choice but to explore . . .</p>&#13;

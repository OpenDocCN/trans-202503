- en: I decided to write this book because it was the sort of book I wish I had had
    when I was starting out in information security. Though there are certainly more
    informative websites out there than when I first started, I still find it’s difficult
    for a beginner to know what to read first and where to get the expected prerequisite
    skills. Likewise, there are a lot of books on the market—several great ones on
    advanced topics, which require some background knowledge, and many good books
    aimed at beginners, which cover a significant amount of theory. But I haven’t
    found anything that says everything I want to say to the aspiring pentester who
    emails me looking for a place to start in information security.

    Introduction to Pentesting. The students always have a thirst for knowledge that
    is lots of fun to be around. Thus, when I was approached by No Starch Press to
    write a book, this was the book I proposed. When I announced it, many people assumed
    I was writing a mobile security book, but while I considered that, I thought an
    introduction to pentesting would make the biggest impact on the audience I most
    wanted to reach.

    on the part of the information security community. The tools and techniques discussed
    throughout this book are some of the ones my colleagues and I use regularly on
    engagements, and they’ve been developed through the combined efforts of pentesters
    and other security experts all over the world. I’ve contributed to some of these
    open source projects (such as Mona.py, which we’ll use in the exploit development
    chapters), and I hope this book will inspire you to do the same.

    maintaining the Kali Linux pentesting distribution used widely in the field and
    throughout this book. A huge amount of credit also goes to the core developers
    of the Metasploit Framework, as well as its numerous community contributors. Thanks
    too to all the pentesters and researchers who have shared their knowledge, discoveries,
    and techniques with the community so that we can use them to assess the security
    posture of our clients more effectively, and so that teachers like me can use
    them with our students.

    so on that have helped me achieve my goal of becoming a professional pentester.
    I now hope to share the knowledge I’ve gained with other aspiring pentesters.

    on my own journey in infosec, and I encourage you to use them to learn more about
    the many penetration testing topics covered in this book. I hope you enjoy your
    journey as much as I have.

- en: To work through this book, you will need to know how to install software on
    your computer. That’s it. You don’t need to be a Linux expert or know the nitty-gritty
    of how networking protocols work. When you encounter a topic that is not familiar
    to you, I encourage you to do some outside research beyond my explanations if
    you need to—but we will walk step-by-step through all the tools and techniques
    that may be new to you, starting with the Linux command line. When I started in
    information security, the closest thing I’d ever done to hacking was making the
    Windows XP pre-SP2 Start menu say *Georgia* instead of *Start*. And I was pretty
    proud of myself at the time.

    Team members were using the command line at rapid speed and making pop-up windows
    appear on my desktop from across a crowded room. All I knew was that I wanted
    to be like them. There was a lot of hard work between then and now, and there
    will be much more hard work as I endeavor to reach the highest level of information
    security. I only hope that with this book I can inspire more people to follow
    the same path.

    we start out with some basic definitions of the phases of penetration testing.
    In **[Chapter 1](ch01.xhtml "Chapter 1. Setting Up Your Virtual Lab")**, we build
    our small practice laboratory, which we will use to work through the exercises
    in this book. With many books, it’s possible to just download a few programs onto
    your existing platform, but to simulate a penetration test, our approach is a
    bit more involved. I recommend that you take the time to set up your lab and work
    through the hands-on examples with me. Though this book can serve as a reference
    and reminder in the field, I believe it is best to first practice your pentesting
    skills at home.

    the basics of using Kali Linux and Linux operating systems in general. Next, **[Chapter 3](ch03.xhtml
    "Chapter 3. Programming")** covers the basics of programming. Some readers may
    already have a working knowledge in these areas and can skip past them. When I
    first started out, I had some programming experience in C and Java, but I didn’t
    have a background in scripting, and I had practically no background in Linux—a
    skillset that was assumed by most of the hacking tutorials I encountered. Thus,
    I have provided a primer here. If you are new to these areas, please do continue
    your studies outside of this book. Linux-based operating systems are becoming
    more and more prevalent as the platforms for mobile devices and web services,
    so skills in this area will benefit you even if you don’t pursue a career in information
    security. Likewise, knowing how to script your common tasks can only make your
    life easier, regardless of your career.

    throughout this book, in **[Chapter 4](ch04.xhtml "Chapter 4. Using the Metasploit
    Framework")**. Though we will also learn to perform many tasks without Metasploit,
    it is a go-to tool for many pentesters in the field and is constantly evolving
    to include the latest threats and techniques.

    "Chapter 5. Information Gathering")**, we begin by gathering data about our target—both
    by searching freely available information online and by engaging our target systems.
    We then start searching for vulnerabilities using a combination of querying the
    systems and research in **[Chapter 6](ch06.xhtml "Chapter 6. Finding Vulnerabilities")**.
    In **[Chapter 7](ch07.xhtml "Chapter 7. Capturing Traffic")**, we look at techniques
    to capture traffic that might include sensitive data.

    the vulnerabilities we found on the network with a variety of tools and techniques,
    including Metasploit and purely manual exploitation. We then look at methods for
    attacking what is often the weakest link in a network’s security—password management—in
    **[Chapter 9](ch09.xhtml "Chapter 9. Password Attacks")**.

- en: We next look at some more advanced exploitation techniques. Not all vulnerabilities
    are in a service listening on the network. Web browsers, PDF readers, Java, Microsoft
    Office—they all have been subject to security issues. As clients work harder to
    secure their networks, attacking client-side software may be the key to getting
    a foothold in the network. We look at leveraging client-side attacks in **[Chapter 10](ch10.xhtml
    "Chapter 10. Client-Side Exploitation")**. In **[Chapter 11](ch11.xhtml "Chapter 11. Social
    Engineering")**, we combine client-side attacks with a look at social engineering,
    or attacking the human element—the part of the environment that cannot be patched.
    After all, with client-side attacks, the software in question must open a malicious
    file of some sort, so we must convince the user to help us out. In **[Chapter 12](ch12.xhtml
    "Chapter 12. Bypassing Antivirus Applications")**, we look at some methods of
    bypassing antivirus software, as many of your clients will deploy it. If you have
    high enough privileges on a system, you may be able to just turn antivirus programs
    off, but a better solution is to breeze right past antivirus programs undetected,
    which can be done even if you are saving malicious programs to the hard drive.

- en: In **[Chapter 13](ch13.xhtml "Chapter 13. Post Exploitation")**, we pick up
    with the next phase of our penetration test, post exploitation. Some say the pentest
    truly begins after exploitation. This is where you leverage your access to find
    additional systems to attack, sensitive information to steal, and so on. If you
    continue your penetration testing studies, you will spend a good deal of time
    working on the latest and greatest post-exploitation techniques.

- en: After post exploitation, we look at a few additional skills you will need to
    be a well-rounded penetration tester. We will take a brief look at assessing the
    security of custom web applications in **[Chapter 14](ch14.xhtml "Chapter 14. Web
    Application Testing")**. Everyone has a website these days, so it’s a good skill
    to cultivate. Next we will look at assessing the security of wireless networks
    in **[Chapter 15](ch15.xhtml "Chapter 15. Wireless Attacks")**, looking at methods
    for cracking commonly deployed cryptographic systems.

    own Metasploit module. Up until these chapters, we have relied on tools and publicly
    available exploits for a lot of our exercises. As you advance in infosec, you
    may want to find new bugs (called zero-days) and report them to vendors for a
    possible bounty. You can then release a public exploit and/or Metasploit module
    to help other pentesters test their customers’ environments for the issue you
    discovered.'

    Framework. Perhaps after mastering the skills in this book, you will endeavor
    to develop and release a security tool of your own.

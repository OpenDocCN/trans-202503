<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">T</span>he 1.0 release went out, the G1 launched, and everyone breathed a quiet sigh of relief on completing a difficult job. And then they went back to work. </p>
<p>It was clear to the team that Android was far from complete; there was so much more to do in terms of features and quality to make Android more competitive. And there were more devices to come.</p>
<p>For the next year, the team worked furiously on smaller bug-fix releases as well as larger “dessert” releases, culminating in the Eclair release that shipped with the Droid device at the end of 2009. In one year alone, the team shipped four major releases 1.1 (Petit Four), 1.5 (Cupcake), 1.6 (Donut), and 2.0 (Eclair).</p>
<p>Tom Moss noted that this frantic pace was intentional: “Two reasons: Andy’s a perfectionist, and he wanted the product to get better. It really upsets him personally when the product is not good enough. But it was also an intentional strategy to stop OEMs from trying to fork by saying, ‘By the time you get your fork up, we’ll have the new version of Android out, and you’re going to have to start over again.’</p>
<p>“He intentionally pushed us to have multiple releases per year in order to disincentivize or disable people from forking.”</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c43-0001"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_332" title="332"/>1.0 r2: November 2008</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The first bug-fix release was notable because, well, it was the first. Version 1.0 was released in September of 2008. That release was the one installed on the G1 phones that were then sold in October. In November, r2 was released, which added some functionality and apps, in addition to various bug fixes.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c43-0002">1.1 Petit Four: February 2009</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Version 1.1 was the first named release: <em>Petit Four</em> (a small cake, French for “little oven”). It was a relatively small release, with bug fixes and a few API additions. It also provided localization for other languages (1.0 had support for English only), which turned out to be an important feature for this very international platform.</p>
<p>From this point on, whenever there was a bump in the “dot” version number (the number after the first dot, in this case 1.1 versus the original release of 1.0), it meant that there were API changes in the release. API changes meant that applications built against the previous version of the SDK would run on the newer version (Android always tries to maintain forward compatibility), but applications built against the new version might not run on the old version (because use of new APIs that don’t exist on the older version would cause an error on the older system).</p>
<p>The 1.1 release was the first one in which Android Market enabled applications for sale. Prior to 1.1, the mechanism for charging users for applications wasn’t yet working, so Market allowed only free apps.</p>
<p>Petit Four was also the first time a dessert name was used for an Android release, although it was clearly not following the convention of starting with successive letters in the alphabet; that tradition would start with the next release, Cupcake.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c43-0003">1.5 Cupcake: April 2009</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Cupcake was the first release that established the tradition of consecutive-letter-desserts. It started with “C” because it was the third major release and “Cupcake” was chosen as the C dessert name because Ryan PC Gibson (the person running the releases at the time) was obsessed with cupcakes.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c43-footnote-1" id="c43-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup></p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_333" title="333"/>Cupcake brought some notable features for developers and users. App Widgets<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c43-footnote-2" id="c43-footnoteref-2">2</a></sup> first appeared. Video recording was now available. Developers could develop and distribute their own keyboard applications. Also, there was a new sensor and logic to detect rotation, so users could rotate their phone for landscape versus portrait mode display. Prior to that change, users needed to slide out the keyboard on the G1, which automatically put the display into landscape mode.</p>
<p>The Cupcake release was also coincident with a new device: the HTC Magic. The Magic was the first touch-only device; the hardware keyboard of the G1 was replaced by the now-familiar onscreen software keyboard.</p>
<p>The release notes for Cupcake did have one piece of bad news for developers and users: <em>“We regret to inform developers that Android 1.5 will not include support for the Zilog Z80 processor</em><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c43-footnote-3" id="c43-footnoteref-3">3</a></sup> <em>architecture.”</em></p>
<h2 id="h1-502680c43-0004">1.6 Donut: September 2009</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The Donut release rounded out various pieces of the platform for general use. The telephony stack now supported CDMA, the system used by Verizon (this would come in handy with, for example, the Motorola Droid, which launched on the Verizon network). The framework team finished adding support for arbitrary screen sizes and densities, which was important in enabling a broader ecosystem of all kinds of different form factors.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c43-footnote-4" id="c43-footnoteref-4">4</a></sup> Donut also included a speech-to-text engine. It was not nearly as powerful as the systems used in phones today but was an indicator of where things could go.</p>
<p>The Donut release notes also carried some unfortunate news: <em>“We regret to inform developers that Android 1.6 will not include support for RFC 2549.”</em><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c43-footnote-5" id="c43-footnoteref-5">5</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="h1-502680c43-0005">2.0 Eclair: October 2009</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">One thing that’s interesting to note about the Eclair release is how soon it shipped after the Donut release—just one month separated them.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c43-footnote-6" id="c43-footnoteref-6">6</a></sup> Not only was the team working very hard at the time on multiple, frequent releases in parallel, but in fact the Eclair release was actually finished <em>before</em> the Donut release shipped.</p>
<p>Various features were added in Eclair, including Live Wallpapers and turn-by-turn navigation.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c43-footnote-7" id="c43-footnoteref-7">7</a></sup> But perhaps the most notable thing about Eclair was that it was implemented in conjunction with the new Droid and Passion (Nexus One) devices, which launched soon after Eclair was released. The Passion device was the one that the team really had its heart set on, but the Droid was the first device that was successful with a large consumer market.</p>

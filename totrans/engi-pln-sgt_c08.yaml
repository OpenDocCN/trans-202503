    a sewer system or electrical grid off the shelf at a store. Rather, these complex
    facilities are constructed in place by humans and machines. Construction can be
    both a nuisance and a joy, depending on your perspective (or your commute). It
    often seems noisy, disruptive, and slow. However, the giant-sized equipment and
    the urgency of effort evoke a sense of wonder and awe in the attentive observer.
    There is nothing quite like witnessing a structure take shape from raw materials
    and hard work, and it’s often difficult to walk past any construction site without
    being distracted by the continual commotion.'

    being built, a construction site may look like a disorganized frenzy of machines
    and activity at first glance. However, look closely, and you’ll begin to understand
    the rhythm. Although every construction job is unique, the site where the work

  zh: 无论是道路、桥梁、大坝、管道还是其他任何正在建设的基础设施，建筑工地乍一看可能像是一片杂乱无章的机器和活动的狂乱景象。然而，仔细观察，你会开始理解其中的节奏。虽然每个建筑项目都是独特的，但施工地点在不同项目之间通常非常相似。
- en: Before construction can begin, a surveyor must lay out the location of the project
    on the ground. Surveyors install control points away from the area of disturbance
    that can be used as a reference once construction begins. They are usually large
    nails driven into the underlying concrete or asphalt or iron rods driven into
    the soil. Surveyors often mark control points and other essential features of
    construction with wooden stakes and plastic flagging tape. Linear construction
    projects like roadways and pipelines often use a coordinate system called *stationing*.
    In the United States, each station is equal to 100 feet. It’s common to see locations
    on a site labeled with their distance along the centerline of the structure in
    stations plus the number of feet (for example, “STA 12+50” indicates a location
    1,250 feet along the axis).

  zh: 在建设开始之前，测量员必须在地面上标出项目的位置。测量员会在施工区域外安装控制点，这些控制点可以在施工开始后作为参考。控制点通常是大钉子，钉入下面的混凝土或沥青中，或者是铁杆，插入土壤中。测量员常用木桩和塑料旗带来标记控制点和其他建设关键要素。像道路和管道这样的线性建设项目通常使用一种叫做*站点定位*的坐标系统。在美国，每个站点等于100英尺。通常可以看到工地上的位置被标注为沿结构中心线的距离，单位是站点加上英尺数（例如，“STA
    12+50”表示在轴线上1,250英尺的位置）。
- en: In addition to surveying, all subsurface utilities must be identified and marked
    to ensure that excavators don’t inadvertently damage underground lines. Locators
    use colored spray paint to create utility location marks on the ground. In many
    parts of the world, these colors are standardized. For example, red is used for
    electric lines, orange for telecommunications, yellow for natural gas, green for
    sewers, and blue for drinking water lines. White paint is used to show the location
    of any excavations that will take place during construction, and pink is reserved

    move, load, and unload supplies. Having these large vehicles drive directly on
    the ground typically ends in a muddy mess, especially after rain. Therefore, contractors
    often construct temporary roads on the site to keep construction traffic flowing.

    of traffic lanes or a detour around the site. Contractors install traffic cones,
    barrels, barriers, and barricades to redirect vehicles and keep them away from

- en: One nuisance created by construction occurs from disturbance of the ground.
    Rain can easily wash away unprotected soil. These suspended sediments are considered
    pollutants because they degrade the quality of natural water bodies and impact
    wildlife habitat. So, most construction projects are required to have facilities
    that control stormwater runoff and keep it from carrying soil off the site. Silt
    fences and filter socks slow down runoff so the sediment can drop out of suspension.
    Stabilized entrances use rocks to knock the mud off the vehicles’ tires before
    they leave the site. Finally, check dams are placed in channels to keep flows
    from concentrating, which reduces the potential for erosion.

    They are often equipped with steel booms that can reach long distances and great
    heights. The largest booms are made from a lattice of steel bars to be both lightweight
    and extremely stiff. In addition, many manufacturers offer jibs that can be attached

- en: Like crawler cranes, rough terrain cranes ride atop a mobile undercarriage,
    but they use rubber tires instead of tracks. Rough terrain cranes are best at
    accessing remote and challenging locations. They are usually smaller than crawler
    cranes, making them faster to set up and easier to fit into spaces that other
    cranes could not. Many rough terrain cranes feature telescoping booms with sections
    that extend outward to increase the crane’s reach. They can be driven (slowly)
    while carrying a load, making it possible to move heavy objects across long distances
    on a construction site. However, their load rating increases significantly when
    operating in a fixed location on outriggers. These devices stabilize the crane
    by lifting the undercarriage off the pliable tires. *All-terrain cranes* work

    all of a project’s duration. On a construction site, the most common type of fixed
    crane is the tower crane. It consists of a vertical mast and a horizontal jib
    extending out from the tower. The jib can rotate in any direction around the mast

    only for projects with extended durations, like tall buildings. They often have
    a base of reinforced concrete and require another crane for assembly and disassembly.
    Some tower cranes can raise themselves, allowing the mast to increase in height
    as a building is built up from the ground. A climbing frame secures two sections
    of the mast as they are disconnected, lifting the upper part of the crane. Next,
    the crane raises and inserts a new mast section into the opening the climbing
    frame creates, where it is bolted into place. This process can be repeated as
    many times as needed to reach the desired height.

    to another, so cranes have many ways to move. Nearly all cranes have a drum onto
    which cabling is spooled. When a crane rotates the drum to lift a load using the
    cable, it is called hoisting. In addition to hoisting, some booms can pivot, allowing
    the crane to change the boom angle with cables or hydraulic cylinders. When the
    boom of a crane pivots up with a load, it is called luffing. Some cranes can luff
    the boom and jib separately, providing an even greater range of movement. Swinging
    the boom or jib horizontally is often called slewing. Finally, cranes with telescoping
    booms can extend or retract, and tower crane trolleys can travel inward or outward.

    to balance the load on the hook, reducing the crane’s tendency to tip over (called
    its *moment*). Finally, on windy days, mobile cranes are generally taken down,
    and tower crane brakes are released so that the jibs can *weathervane*, allowing

  zh: 混凝土结构会自行固化和硬化，但土质材料和沥青路面必须压实到位。在大型项目中，这项任务通常通过压路机完成，压路机是一种重型车辆，配备一或两个平滑滚筒，随着压路机的前进压实土壤或沥青。一些压路机配有橡胶轮胎，帮助揉捏基础层或沥青，加速压实过程。类似地，用于粘土土壤的压实机有时会使用一种叫做“羊足滚筒”的有纹理的滚筒。最后，许多压路机能够振动，增强其平整和压实表面的能力。
- en: Piles are another common part of many construction projects that consist of
    vertical structural elements drilled or driven into the ground to create retaining
    walls and foundations. Pile drivers use large hammers or vibratory mechanisms
    to push steel or concrete piles into the subsurface. Where piles are installed
    in holes, a drill rig is used to excavate shafts using an auger or other rotating
    tool.

  zh: 桩基是许多建筑项目中常见的一部分，由垂直的结构元素组成，这些元素被钻入或打入地下，用于构建挡土墙和基础。桩机使用大型锤子或振动装置将钢桩或混凝土桩打入地下。当桩被安装在孔中时，钻机会使用螺旋钻头或其他旋转工具来开挖井孔。
- en: Many construction projects involve casting wet concrete into forms on site.
    You may have seen a concrete mixer truck transporting concrete from a plant to
    a project site. The large drum has a spiral-shaped blade inside. When the drum
    rotates in one direction, it mixes concrete ingredients to keep them from separating
    during transit. When the drum rotates in the other direction, concrete is pushed
    toward the back of the drum to be discharged. Some projects can use concrete directly
    from a truck, but often concrete is needed in locations that are difficult to
    access. Therefore, mixer trucks often discharge into concrete pumps that can transport
    the wet mix through pipes. Some concrete pumps are also equipped with an articulating
    overhead boom, allowing concrete to be placed wherever needed with high accuracy.

  zh: 许多建筑项目涉及将湿混凝土浇筑到现场的模板中。你可能见过混凝土搅拌车将混凝土从工厂运送到施工现场。大型搅拌筒内有一个螺旋形刀片。当搅拌筒朝一个方向旋转时，它会混合混凝土原料，防止它们在运输过程中分离。当搅拌筒朝另一个方向旋转时，混凝土会被推向筒体的后部进行排出。有些项目可以直接使用搅拌车的混凝土，但通常需要将混凝土运送到难以进入的地方。因此，搅拌车常常将混凝土排放到混凝土泵中，混凝土泵可以通过管道将湿混凝土输送到需要的地方。有些混凝土泵还配备了可调节的悬臂吊臂，使混凝土能够高精度地放置在需要的位置。
- en: Another class of construction machines called *aerial lifts* has the simple
    goal of safely positioning workers in precarious locations. A scissor lift consists
    of a mobile base driven by an operator and a platform that rises vertically atop
    crisscrossing braces. They move only vertically, so scissor lifts can’t be used
    to maneuver workers around obstacles. A boom lift uses a hydraulic arm to support
    the platform, offering more freedom to access difficult areas on a construction
    site.

  zh: 另一类建筑机械被称为*高空升降机*，其简单的目标是安全地将工人安置在危险位置。剪式升降机由一个操作员驾驶的移动底座和一个垂直升起的由交叉支架支撑的平台组成。它们只能上下移动，因此剪式升降机无法用来在障碍物之间移动工人。而臂式升降机则使用液压臂支撑平台，提供更多的自由度来进入建筑工地上难以到达的区域。
- en: Of course, in addition to the many vehicles used on construction sites, workers
    also use a litany of powered hand tools. Some of the most important construction
    tools are *pneumatic* (in other words, powered by air), necessitating an air compressor
    on site. It is common to spot trailer-mounted air compressors on construction
    projects used to power jackhammers, drills, grinders, nail guns, and many other
    tools workers use.

  zh: 当然，除了在建筑工地上使用的各种车辆外，工人们还使用许多动力手持工具。一些最重要的建筑工具是*气动*工具（换句话说，靠空气驱动），因此工地上需要有空气压缩机。在建筑项目中，常见的是拖车式空气压缩机，它们用来为凿岩机、电钻、磨光机、钉枪以及工人使用的许多其他工具提供动力。

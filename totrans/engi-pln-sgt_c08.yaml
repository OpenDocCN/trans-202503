    a sewer system or electrical grid off the shelf at a store. Rather, these complex
    facilities are constructed in place by humans and machines. Construction can be
    both a nuisance and a joy, depending on your perspective (or your commute). It
    often seems noisy, disruptive, and slow. However, the giant-sized equipment and
    the urgency of effort evoke a sense of wonder and awe in the attentive observer.
    There is nothing quite like witnessing a structure take shape from raw materials
    and hard work, and it’s often difficult to walk past any construction site without
    being distracted by the continual commotion.'

    separate worker and piece of equipment has a specific task. The individual accomplishments
    may seem insignificant or even mundane, but they slowly accumulate into results
    that can be spectacular (as shown in the previous chapters). Observing construction
    sites can be a one-time activity of spotting machines and equipment or a regular
    routine to marvel at the steady progress. No matter how you choose to watch, you
    can always see something interesting on a construction site.

    being built, a construction site may look like a disorganized frenzy of machines
    and activity at first glance. However, look closely, and you’ll begin to understand
    the rhythm. Although every construction job is unique, the site where the work
    takes place is often remarkably similar from project to project.

- en: Before construction can begin, a surveyor must lay out the location of the project
    on the ground. Surveyors install control points away from the area of disturbance
    that can be used as a reference once construction begins. They are usually large
    nails driven into the underlying concrete or asphalt or iron rods driven into
    the soil. Surveyors often mark control points and other essential features of
    construction with wooden stakes and plastic flagging tape. Linear construction
    projects like roadways and pipelines often use a coordinate system called *stationing*.
    In the United States, each station is equal to 100 feet. It’s common to see locations
    on a site labeled with their distance along the centerline of the structure in
    stations plus the number of feet (for example, “STA 12+50” indicates a location
    1,250 feet along the axis).

    to ensure that excavators don’t inadvertently damage underground lines. Locators
    use colored spray paint to create utility location marks on the ground. In many
    parts of the world, these colors are standardized. For example, red is used for
    electric lines, orange for telecommunications, yellow for natural gas, green for
    sewers, and blue for drinking water lines. White paint is used to show the location
    of any excavations that will take place during construction, and pink is reserved
    for survey markings.

    to moving and storing materials. Heavy equipment and large trucks need space to
    move, load, and unload supplies. Having these large vehicles drive directly on
    the ground typically ends in a muddy mess, especially after rain. Therefore, contractors
    often construct temporary roads on the site to keep construction traffic flowing.
    In addition, most sites include a staging area for offloading and storing equipment
    and supplies to be used later in the project.

    around, anyone who has worked in the trades can tell you that it’s challenging
    work. Most of the people on a construction site are tradespeople who perform skilled
    labor such as masons, carpenters, welders, painters, and ironworkers. In addition,
    you may see a *superintendent* who oversees the project, an *inspector* who ensures
    that construction is performed according to the project plans and specifications,
    and safety personnel who act as spotters for potential accidents and resolve any
    hazards before they can result in injury.

    the dangerous tools, and the need to work in precarious locations and heights.
    Many of the elements you can observe on a site are related to worker safety, including
    the *personal protective equipment* worn by each individual. Workers and other
    staff on site are usually required to wear a hard hat to protect against falling
    or protruding objects. Workers also wear high-visibility clothing featuring bright
    colors and reflective stripes to prevent accidents that result from not being
    seen. When working at heights, scaffolding is used to provide temporary platforms
    for crews to access challenging areas. Workers may wear fall protection equipment,
    including a harness and tether, to reduce the danger of falling while working
    at heights or near deep excavations.

    safety of the public as well. Most sites will include a fence to keep wayward
    pedestrians out of hazardous areas, sometimes fitted with a screen to keep the
    wind from blowing dust and discourage theft by hiding expensive tools and equipment.

    of traffic lanes or a detour around the site. Contractors install traffic cones,
    barrels, barriers, and barricades to redirect vehicles and keep them away from
    construction activities. Warning signs and barriers are always orange so that
    drivers can distinguish them easily from other signs to proceed with caution through
    the work zone.

    business, much of the work happens in an office, such as ordering materials, reviewing
    plans, holding meetings, and answering email. On large projects, contractors often
    have an entire workforce of office staff on site to support the construction and
    keep things running smoothly. You may see one or more trailers that serve as temporary
    construction offices for the contractor, site engineer, or owner to use when needed.
    Other trailers may be used for the storage of tools and materials.

- en: One nuisance created by construction occurs from disturbance of the ground.
    Rain can easily wash away unprotected soil. These suspended sediments are considered
    pollutants because they degrade the quality of natural water bodies and impact
    wildlife habitat. So, most construction projects are required to have facilities
    that control stormwater runoff and keep it from carrying soil off the site. Silt
    fences and filter socks slow down runoff so the sediment can drop out of suspension.
    Stabilized entrances use rocks to knock the mud off the vehicles’ tires before
    they leave the site. Finally, check dams are placed in channels to keep flows
    from concentrating, which reduces the potential for erosion.

    sweat and muscles can handle much of this work, but anyone working in the trades
    will tell you that there are plenty of jobs only a crane can accomplish. At many
    job sites, the question is not whether a crane will be used, but how many and
    what types. These backbones of the construction industry make it possible to lift
    and install materials and components much, much larger and heavier than would
    otherwise be possible with only human labor, making construction faster and more

- en: 'Many types of cranes are used on construction sites, and each has its own benefits.
    They are usually divided into two types: *mobile* and *fixed cranes*. Mobile cranes
    have wheels or tracks, allowing them to move to different parts of a site. A crawler
    crane is mounted on an undercarriage with a set of tracks. Crawler cranes are
    the largest and most capable type of mobile cranes found on a construction site.
    They are often equipped with steel booms that can reach long distances and great
    heights. The largest booms are made from a lattice of steel bars to be both lightweight
    and extremely stiff. In addition, many manufacturers offer jibs that can be attached
    to the end of a boom to extend its reach even farther. Crawler cranes aren’t legal
    to drive on roadways, so they are usually trucked to a project to be assembled
    on site.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Like crawler cranes, rough terrain cranes ride atop a mobile undercarriage,
    but they use rubber tires instead of tracks. Rough terrain cranes are best at
    accessing remote and challenging locations. They are usually smaller than crawler
    cranes, making them faster to set up and easier to fit into spaces that other
    cranes could not. Many rough terrain cranes feature telescoping booms with sections
    that extend outward to increase the crane’s reach. They can be driven (slowly)
    while carrying a load, making it possible to move heavy objects across long distances
    on a construction site. However, their load rating increases significantly when
    operating in a fixed location on outriggers. These devices stabilize the crane
    by lifting the undercarriage off the pliable tires. *All-terrain cranes* work
    and look similar to rough terrain cranes, but they are designed to drive on streets
    and highways, eliminating the need to be hauled to a job site on a truck. They
    are usually the smallest of the mobile cranes but also the most versatile.

- en: Fixed cranes are installed in a single location where they remain for some or
    all of a project’s duration. On a construction site, the most common type of fixed
    crane is the tower crane. It consists of a vertical mast and a horizontal jib
    extending out from the tower. The jib can rotate in any direction around the mast
    on a turntable. A trolley that rides along the jib allows the operator in the
    overhead cab to place the hook wherever needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Installation of a tower crane is a feat on its own, so they usually are used
    only for projects with extended durations, like tall buildings. They often have
    a base of reinforced concrete and require another crane for assembly and disassembly.
    Some tower cranes can raise themselves, allowing the mast to increase in height
    as a building is built up from the ground. A climbing frame secures two sections
    of the mast as they are disconnected, lifting the upper part of the crane. Next,
    the crane raises and inserts a new mast section into the opening the climbing
    frame creates, where it is bolted into place. This process can be repeated as
    many times as needed to reach the desired height.

- en: The primary goal of any crane is to relocate or reposition a load from one place
    to another, so cranes have many ways to move. Nearly all cranes have a drum onto
    which cabling is spooled. When a crane rotates the drum to lift a load using the
    cable, it is called hoisting. In addition to hoisting, some booms can pivot, allowing
    the crane to change the boom angle with cables or hydraulic cylinders. When the
    boom of a crane pivots up with a load, it is called luffing. Some cranes can luff
    the boom and jib separately, providing an even greater range of movement. Swinging
    the boom or jib horizontally is often called slewing. Finally, cranes with telescoping
    booms can extend or retract, and tower crane trolleys can travel inward or outward.

    needed to attach, secure, lift, and place a load. If radios are not available,
    standardized hand signals let the operator know which type of movement the crew
    needs. Ground crews also use tag lines when necessary to control the load and
    keep it from spinning.

- en: As vital as they are to construction sites, cranes can also be dangerous. Lots
    of engineering is used to keep them from tipping over. Wooden pads called crane
    mats are often used to distribute the extreme pressure of cranes and keep them
    from sinking into the ground. Counterweights made from steel or concrete are used
    to balance the load on the hook, reducing the crane’s tendency to tip over (called
    its *moment*). Finally, on windy days, mobile cranes are generally taken down,
    and tower crane brakes are released so that the jibs can *weathervane*, allowing
    them to rotate freely with the wind rather than fight against it.

    sites to increase the speed and efficiency of work. Although construction machines
    may seem like just a cacophony of hammering and backup alarms, modern buildings
    and infrastructure could not exist without their capabilities to move, compact,

    use their hydraulic cylinders to perform various functions, including digging
    holes and trenches, removing debris, and even lifting and placing loads like a
    crane. They come in many different sizes, from mini excavators that can fit in
    the back of a pickup truck to gigantic machines too large to be transported on
    a highway in one piece. Trenchers are another type of machine meant specifically

    trees, and boulders from a site, push soil across short distances, and spread
    fill over a large area. Like dozers, graders also feature a long blade. However,
    graders offer more precision, allowing operators to level (or *grade*) the earth
    with high accuracy. Instead of a blade, loaders are equipped with large buckets
    for excavating and transporting larger quantities of soil. These machines also
    come in many sizes, from the tiny skid-steer loaders used on small sites to the
    massive wheel loaders used in mines. When significant volumes of soil must be
    moved across a site, scrapers are the machine for the job. Scrapers cut into the
    earth like a carpenter’s plane, filling a hopper on the vehicle. Then the soil
    can be transported and placed directly from the scraper, eliminating the need
    to transfer it to another vehicle like a dump truck.

    Paving machines are used to lay asphalt on roads, bridges, and parking lots and
    create concrete curbs, gutters, barriers, and highways. Dump trucks or loaders
    feed asphalt or concrete into the machine, which uses a series of mechanical devices
    to create a smooth and even layer as it travels. Pavers that make concrete structures
    use a process called *slipforming* to create continuous shapes like curbs and
    highway barriers. Because the subgrade isn’t always perfectly level, many paving
    and slipform machines use a wand that rides along a stringline set by surveyors
    according to the engineered alignment of the roadway. The wand controls the steering
    and position of the paving machine to ensure that the road and its other features
    are smooth and consistent.

    asphalt pavement must be compacted into place. On large projects, this task is
    typically accomplished using a roller compactor, a heavy vehicle with one or two
    smooth drums that compress the soil or asphalt as they roll over it. Some roller
    compactors are equipped with rubber tires that help knead the subgrade or asphalt,
    speeding the compaction processes. Similarly, compactors used on sticky clay soils
    sometimes use a textured roller called a sheepsfoot drum. Finally, many roller
    compactors can vibrate, increasing their ability to smooth and flatten the surface.

    vertical structural elements drilled or driven into the ground to create retaining
    walls and foundations. Pile drivers use large hammers or vibratory mechanisms

    in holes, a drill rig is used to excavate shafts using an auger or other rotating
    tool.

    You may have seen a concrete mixer truck transporting concrete from a plant to
    a project site. The large drum has a spiral-shaped blade inside. When the drum
    rotates in one direction, it mixes concrete ingredients to keep them from separating
    during transit. When the drum rotates in the other direction, concrete is pushed
    toward the back of the drum to be discharged. Some projects can use concrete directly
    from a truck, but often concrete is needed in locations that are difficult to
    access. Therefore, mixer trucks often discharge into concrete pumps that can transport
    the wet mix through pipes. Some concrete pumps are also equipped with an articulating
    overhead boom, allowing concrete to be placed wherever needed with high accuracy.

    goal of safely positioning workers in precarious locations. A scissor lift consists
    of a mobile base driven by an operator and a platform that rises vertically atop
    crisscrossing braces. They move only vertically, so scissor lifts can’t be used
    to maneuver workers around obstacles. A boom lift uses a hydraulic arm to support
    the platform, offering more freedom to access difficult areas on a construction
    site.

    projects used to power jackhammers, drills, grinders, nail guns, and many other

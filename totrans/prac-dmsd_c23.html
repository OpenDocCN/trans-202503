			<p class="ChapterIntro">Most emergencies are slow and boring, a far cry from what we see in action-packed disaster films: everybody is stuck at home, the internet is out, and you can’t even turn on the stereo, cook anything fancy, or run any power tools. At the same time, the lingering uncertainty and the transitional nature of the event make it difficult to focus on profound creative endeavors. In other words, that novel you have in the works probably isn’t getting finished any time soon.</p>
			<p>
				It follows that having a way to pass the time can be an important component of a survival strategy, even if it sounds frivolous compared to the consequential matters discussed before. For groups of people, classic board games such as Risk, Monopoly, or Scrabble tend to work well—and are sometimes available in travel-sized varieties. A deck of cards, along with a pocket rule book, can be a source of old-fashioned fun too. For small <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_192" title="192"/>children, a new plush toy or two is worth including in any evacuation kit; for adolescents and adults alike, an interesting book or a mechanical puzzle game can do the trick.</p>
			<p>Of course, there’s no need to go low-tech. Handheld gaming consoles, ebook readers, and portable media players are all great options, provided that they work reliably without a network connection and that you have a way to recharge them every now and then. The precise choices are a matter of personal preference, but in the end, a small library of games, books, or fun electronics has a place in every preparedness plan.</p>
			<p>Another discretionary prep I like is keeping a small cache of doomsday “party favors”: inexpensive but useful goods that can be handed out to neighbors or relatives in need. These may include cheap dollar-store flashlights, AM/FM radios, or wristwatches—or indeed, a travel-sized board game or a deck of cards. Other low-cost examples are travel-size oral hygiene kits, antiperspirant, energy bars, or water treatment pills.</p>
			<p>Handing out such practical items during a power outage or other minor calamity leaves the entire neighborhood better off, earns you goodwill, and can make others reflect on the merits of prepping after the crisis ends. Just as important, it can set clear boundaries with those who know you prep. When you’re proactive and offer every person the same modest but valuable deal, you’re less likely to be suspected of playing favorites or hoarding more.</p>

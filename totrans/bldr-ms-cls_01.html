We’ll explore its user interface, how to navigate the 3D Viewport, and how to add and interact with objects. Throughout this chapter, I’ll point to later parts of the book, where various topics will be covered in greater detail.

Originally created as an in-house animation package for Dutch animation studio NeoGeo, it was later released under the GNU General Public License when its developer, NotANumber, went bankrupt and the Blender community raised €100,000 to pay creditors to release the Blender source code.</p><p>Since then, Blender has undergone continued development by the Blender community, overseen by the Blender Foundation (headed by Ton Roosendaal, one of the original developers of Blender). The current version (Blender 2.6<span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>, as this book goes to press) boasts a wide array of features competitive with many commercial 3D applications and has a committed and enthusiastic community creating art and animation with it.</p><p>Blender is used today by many animation studios, game developers, artists, and hobbyists. It has been used to make feature films, short films, and games. Of particular note are the Blender Foundation’s open movie projects—community-funded short film projects that are used to drive the development of Blender forward by using it in a production environment. To date, four short films and one game have been completed, each yielding significant improvements and new features in Blender’s repertoire. The first short film, <span class="emphasis"><em>Elephants Dream</em></span>, premiered in 2006. It’s a surreal tale in which two characters travel through a bizarre mechanical <a id="iddle1005" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1162" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1176" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1178" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1340" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1383" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1449" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1649" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1736" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2027" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2119" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2288" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2336" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2373" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2469" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2565" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2607" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2691" class="indexterm"/>world. It introduced particle-based hair and fur rendering, as well as new animation tools and improvements to Blender’s render engine. In 2008, <span class="emphasis"><em>Big Buck Bunny</em></span> introduced improvements to fur rendering, particles, and the render pipeline, as well as more advanced rigging and animation constraints. In 2010, <span class="emphasis"><em>Sintel</em></span>, a tale about a girl and her dragon, brought advanced sculpting tools, new simulation tools, and shading and rendering improvements.</p><p>The latest open movie, <span class="emphasis"><em>Tears of Steel</em></span>, focused on adding advanced visual effects tools to Blender. It brought major improvements to the new Cycles render engine and has introduced camera tracking tools, new features for Blender’s compositor, improved simulation tools, and better color management.</p><p>Current, stable Blender builds for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X are available from <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.blender.org/" target="_top">http://www.blender.org/</a></em></span>. In addition, you can find development builds featuring the latest updates from <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.graphicall.org/" target="_top">http://www.graphicall.org/</a></em></span>. These development builds are designed for more advanced users or those who wish to try new features; they can be unstable, so stick with the official builds for important work.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="The Blender User Interface"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="blender_user_interface">The Blender User Interface</h2></div></div></div><p>Blender’s user interface (UI) has earned a reputation for being difficult to grasp. In earlier versions, this reputation was somewhat justified, but since Blender 2.5, the interface has seen major updates and is now much more predictable and easier to learn. Plus, with the addition of the search function, if you have trouble finding a particular operator, you can search for it by pressing the spacebar to bring up a search dialog in which you can search for operators by name.</p><p>Once you have grasped the UI, you’ll find that Blender is very fast and extremely customizable. Most functions have keyboard commands for quicker access, and the interface is non-blocking, which means that windows and dialogs won’t be layered on top of one another, obscuring your view.</p><div class="sect2" title="Layout and UI Terminology"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="layout_and_ui_terminology">Layout and UI Terminology</h3></div></div></div><p>When you first start Blender, the default layout should look something like <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#blenderapostrophes_default_ui_layoutdot" title="Figure 1-1. Blender’s default UI layout.

To resize an editor (or a region), click and drag on its border. To split or merge editors, right-click the editor’s border and choose either Split Area or Merge Area.

To switch layouts, click the screen layout drop-down menu in the Info editor header (see <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#switching_layouts_with_the_screen_layout" title="Figure 1-4. Switching layouts with the screen layout drop-down menu">Figure 1-4</a>).</p><p>By default, Blender includes layouts named <span class="emphasis"><em>Animation</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Compositing</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Default</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Game Logic</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Scripting</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>UV Editing</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>3D View Full</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Motion Tracking</em></span>, and <span class="emphasis"><em>Video Editing</em></span>, each of which is pretty well suited to the task that it’s named for. (Default is the default layout when you start Blender and is good for modeling.) To add your own layout, click the + icon at the right of the drop-down menu to copy the current layout and modify it, or delete the current layout by clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>X</strong></span> icon.

The simplest is with the mouse. Scrolling the mouse wheel zooms in and out, holding the middle mouse button rotates the view, and <span class="smaller">SHIFT</span>-middle mouse button pans the view. To center the view on the currently selected object, press <span class="smaller">NUMPAD</span>. (period), and to reset the view to center on the scene’s origin, press <span class="smaller">SHIFT</span>-C.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01note01"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Blender treats the number pad keys and the corresponding keys on the keyboard differently. For example, the number pad (numpad) numbers are used for navigating the 3D view, while the character key numbers are used to toggle visibility of different scene layers.</em></span></p></div><p>You can also snap the viewpoint to specific angles using the number pad. <span class="smaller">NUMPAD</span> 7 snaps to top-down view, <span class="smaller">NUMPAD</span> 1 snaps to front view, and <span class="smaller">NUMPAD</span> 3 snaps to side view. <span class="smaller">NUMPAD</span> 5 switches between a perspective view, where objects in the distance appear smaller (as in real life), and an orthographic view, where objects appear the same size at all distances. When combined with the top, side, and front views, orthographic view is most useful for aligning objects precisely.</p><p>The 3D Viewport has multiple display modes that can be selected from the 3D Viewport header (see <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#blenderapostrophes_3d_viewport_in_detail" title="Figure 1-5. Blender’s 3D Viewport in detail">Figure 1-5</a>). These viewing modes include the default solid view; wireframe; bounding box, which represents objects as simple boxes instead of displaying their geometry; and textured view, which can display shading and texturing. In later chapters, we’ll look at customizing the 3D Viewport for different purposes, including using different textured shading modes and working with layers and hiding objects.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Coordinates in 3D and the Grid Floor"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title" id="coordinates_in_3d_and_the_grid_floor">Coordinates in 3D and the Grid Floor</h4></div></div></div><p>If you haven’t dealt with 3D graphics before, you may not have thought about how to define a point in space. Of course, 3D models are essentially created by connecting points in space. Thankfully, French philosopher and mathematician René Descartes gave us a solution to this problem several centuries before we got around to inventing computers and 3D graphics.</p><p>To define a point in 3D space, we need information about the point’s position in each spatial dimension in relation to a <span class="emphasis"><em>reference point</em></span>. In Blender, this information comes in the form of the point’s <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>-, <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>-, and <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span>-coordinates, which indicate the point’s position along three axes that run perpendicular to one another. These are called Blender’s <span class="emphasis"><em>global coordinates</em></span>. The reference point we use is called the scene’s <span class="emphasis"><em>origin</em></span>—the point whose coordinates for each of the axes is zero.</p><p>By convention, we generally think of the <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>-axis as being the “left–right” axis, the <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>-axis as the “forward–back” axis, and <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span>-axis as the “up–down” axis. (The different viewpoints given by the keyboard shortcuts mentioned above conform to this convention—the top-down view looks downward along the <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span>-axis, and so on.)</p><p>You can see the <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>- and <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>-axes in Blender’s 3D Viewport as red and green lines, respectively. Extending from these lines in light gray is the <span class="emphasis"><em>grid floor</em></span>, which we generally use as the ground height of the scene when placing objects. The divisions of the grid are all 1 Blender unit apart by default, giving you a guide to use for placing objects and judging their size. The <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>- and <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>-axes and the grid floor are also useful when orienting yourself in Blender’s 3D Viewport.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="The Properties Editor"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="properties_editor">The Properties Editor</h3></div></div></div><p>The Properties editor is where you can define the settings and properties for a scene or a selected object. The Properties editor is divided into Header and Main regions, with the Main region being split into tabs (as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#panels_within_the_properties_editor" title="Figure 1-2. Panels within the Properties editor">Figure 1-2</a>). Each tab contains a different set of properties that relates to either the current scene or the active object. In order of appearance, the tabs are as follows:</p><p title="Render"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Render</strong></span></strong></span>. The Render tab contains settings for rendering your scene, including render dimensions, shading options, and output formats. (We’ll discuss this in more detail in <a class="xref" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. Rendering and Compositing">Chapter 14</a>.)</p><p title="Scene"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Scene</strong></span></strong></span>. The Scene tab lets you set the properties of your scene, such as the active camera, certain sound settings, and the scene’s units (arbitrary Blender units, imperial, or metric).</p><p title="World"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>World</strong></span></strong></span>. The World tab lets you define the scene’s background, as well as the world lighting <a id="iddle1264" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1483" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1501" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1529" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1541" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1592" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1617" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1650" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1717" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1778" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1827" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1841" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1883" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1973" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1974" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1985" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1987" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2043" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2052" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2078" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2129" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2166" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2208" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2249" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2349" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2366" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2546" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2654" class="indexterm"/>options, such as environment lighting and ambient occlusion.

You can manage an object’s group membership as well as how it is displayed. (We’ll use groups in <a class="xref" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Hair and Particle Systems">Chapter 9</a> to duplicate multiple objects using particle systems.)</p><p title="Object Constraints"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Object Constraints</strong></span></strong></span>. The Object Constraints tab contains an object’s constraints stack. This is useful for animation but not a topic that we’ll cover. (See the Blender wiki at <span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://wiki.blender.org/" target="_top">http://wiki.blender.org/</a></em></span> for more on constraints.)</p><p title="Object Modifiers"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Object Modifiers</strong></span></strong></span>. This tab contains an object’s modifiers stack and lets you add new modifiers. Modifiers are procedural, nondestructive methods for manipulating and generating a mesh’s geometry. As you add new modifiers to an object, they are applied in the order they appear in the stack (from top to bottom). (We’ll discuss modifiers in more detail in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Blocking In">Chapter 4</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Modeling the Details">Chapter 5</a>.)</p><p title="Object Data"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Object Data</strong></span></strong></span>. The Object Data tab lets you set which datablock the active object uses and exposes the different sets of data assigned to this datablock (see <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#datablocks" title="Datablocks">Datablocks</a>). The contents of this tab vary according to the object’s type. For example, in the case of a mesh object, this tab will display the mesh’s vertex groups, shape keys, and UV coordinate sets, whereas for a lamp object, it will contain the lamp’s color, energy, and shadow settings. The icon for this tab also changes to match the active object’s type: For mesh objects, the icon is a cube; for lamps, a light; and so on. The Object Data tab will come up throughout this book.</p><p title="Material"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Material</strong></span></strong></span>. The Materials tab displays an object’s material slots and the materials assigned to them. Here, you can edit the basic properties of the materials you create, turn on or off different shading options, and adjust the properties of an object’s material.</p><p title="Textures"><span class="title"><strong><span class="strong"><strong>Textures</strong></span></strong></span>. The Textures tab complements the Materials panel. It lets you assign textures to a material, define how textures affect the properties of a material, and determine how they are mapped to an object’s surface. (We’ll cover this tab in more detail in <a class="xref" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Materials">Chapter 12</a>.)

It’s usually kept scaled down to show just the header, which is its most important part. The header contains various menus, including the File menu, the Help menu, and menus for adding objects and rendering.</p><p>The drop-down menu selectors to the right of these menus let you change the window layout (discussed above) and the current scene (discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#scenes" title="Scenes">Scenes</a>).

From left to right, the scene information includes the vertex count (Verts); face count (Faces); number of objects in the scene (Objects); number of lamps (Lamps); the scene’s memory consumption; and the name of the currently selected object.</p><p>If you drag down the border of the Info editor, you will see that Blender uses the rest of the editor to provide a log of your actions as Python commands. This information provides a glimpse into the behind-the-scenes workings of Blender’s Python API (application programming interface) as you work, and it can be most helpful when creating Python scripts. However, since we won’t need Blender’s scripting features for any of the projects in this book, it can remain hidden most of the time.</p><div class="figure"><a id="info_editor_header"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00011"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538264.png.jpg" alt="The Info editor header"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 1-6. The Info editor header</div></div></div><div class="sect2" title="The Node Editor"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="node_editor">The Node Editor</h3></div></div></div><p><a id="iddle1171" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1177" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1582" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1651" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1779" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1946" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2246" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2248" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2624" class="indexterm"/>The Node editor is a multipurpose editor for anything that is (or can be) constructed with nodes.

By default, this scene contains three objects: a cube, a lamp, and a camera. These objects are all that is required to get a simple render of something more than a blank background. The camera tells Blender what viewpoint it should render, the cube provides something for the camera to view, and the lamp illuminates the cube and makes it appear as more than a simple black silhouette.</p><p>However, a gray cube on a gray background doesn’t make for the most interesting of renders.

Perhaps the simplest way is to use the keyboard shortcuts: <span class="strong"><strong>G</strong></span> to move, <span class="strong"><strong>R</strong></span> to rotate, and <span class="strong"><strong>S</strong></span> to scale. You can also use the manipulator widget (see <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#three_functions_of_the_manipulator_widge" title="Figure 1-10. The three functions of the manipulator widget: translate, rotate, and scale">Figure 1-10</a>) to manipulate objects by clicking and dragging one of its three handles to manipulate one axis or by clicking and dragging the white circle in the middle to manipulate the object on any axis.</p><p>By default, the manipulator appears as three colored arrows. Click and drag on the arrows to move your selected objects in the directions they point (along the global <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>-, <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>-, and <span class="emphasis"><em>z</em></span>-axes by default). Use the icons in the 3D Viewport header to have the manipulator widget let you rotate or scale objects instead of move them (see <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#three_functions_of_the_manipulator_widge" title="Figure 1-10. The three functions of the manipulator widget: translate, rotate, and scale">Figure 1-10</a>).</p><p>By default, when in Object mode, Blender uses the object’s local coordinate origin (see <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#choosing_different_pivot_points_for_the" title="Figure 1-11. Choosing different pivot points for the 3D manipulator widget">Figure 1-11</a>) as the position of the manipulator widget. To change the pivot center of an operator, use the Pivot Center option in the 3D Viewport header. You can switch between using the median point of the selected objects origins (the default), the origin of the active object, the individual origins of each object in your selection, the 3D cursor, and the center of a hypothetical bounding box drawn around all selected objects.

However, objects also have their own individual coordinate systems and their own origins (the latter being indicated by a small orange circle when you have the object selected). These coordinates are called the object’s <span class="emphasis"><em>local coordinates</em></span>, and they may match up with the scene’s global coordinates or they may not (see <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#global_and_local_coordinates" title="Figure 1-12. Global and local coordinates">Figure 1-12</a>). For example, when you move an object in Object mode, you move its local coordinate origin along with it, and when you scale or rotate it, you scale or rotate its local coordinate axes. This may sound confusing, but it has an important purpose. The positions of the vertices of a mesh (that you can edit in Edit mode) are defined relative to the object’s local coordinates. This means that however you move, scale, or rotate an object in <a id="iddle1356" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1357" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1375" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1422" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1424" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1620" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1975" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1998" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle1999" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2000" class="indexterm"/><a id="iddle2015" class="indexterm"/>Object mode, the mesh’s vertices remain unchanged in terms of their local coordinates.

The first has been moved in Object mode so that its origin is no longer at the global origin, but its axes still point in the same directions as the global coordinate axes. The second has been moved and also rotated so that neither its origin nor the directions of its local coordinate axes match up with the global coordinates. With respect to the objects’ meshes, however, the local coordinates still point in the same directions—the <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span>-axis out of the top of the monkey’s head and the <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span>-axis out from its left ear.</p><p>You can view an object’s local coordinates by going to the Object tab of the Properties editor and enabling the Axis setting in the Display panel.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Operators"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="operators">Operators</h3></div></div></div><p>Translation, rotation, and scaling are among the simplest ways to interact with an object.

(We’ll use this technique in later chapters to save time when working on multiple copies of the same object.)</p><p>The same goes for other kinds of datablocks. For example, in the case of materials and textures, you can assign the same material to multiple objects or the same texture to multiple materials, to save time and to avoid having to create unique materials and textures for every object. Of course, this feature also means that we have to keep track of which object is using which datablocks and how many users a datablock has. To see how many users a datablock has, look next to its name in the drop-down menu where it is selected. Datablocks with multiple users will show how many users they have to the right of their name (see <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#examining_object_datadot_herecomma_a_cub" title="Figure 1-14. Examining object data.

To access other modes, click the Modes drop-down menu in the header of the 3D Viewport (see <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#blenderapostrophes_3d_viewport_in_detail" title="Figure 1-5. Blender’s 3D Viewport in detail">Figure 1-5</a>) and select the mode you want.</p><p>In <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Blocking In">Chapter 4</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Modeling the Details">Chapter 5</a>, we’ll use Edit mode extensively for modeling, and in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Sculpting">Chapter 6</a>, we’ll use Sculpt mode. Then in <a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. UV Unwrapping">Chapter 8</a>, we’ll use Particle mode and Weight Paint mode to create and comb particle hair and paint vertex groups for controlling fur. Then, in <a class="xref" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Texture Painting">Chapter 11</a>, we’ll use Texture Paint mode to paint textures on our models.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Saving and Loading"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="saving_and_loading">Saving and Loading</h3></div></div></div><p>Saving and loading in Blender works much the same way that it does in any application. Use <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span>▸<span class="strong"><strong>Save</strong></span> (<span class="smaller">CTRL</span>-S) to save and <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span>▸<span class="strong"><strong>Open</strong></span> (<span class="smaller">CTRL</span>-O) to open a file.</p><p>Blender saves files in a unique <span class="emphasis"><em>.blend</em></span> format. By default, external files, such as images loaded into Blender, are not saved along with the <span class="emphasis"><em>.blend</em></span> file but are referenced relative to the file. Thus, to open a <span class="emphasis"><em>.blend</em></span> file on another computer, you need to copy over the <span class="emphasis"><em>.blend</em></span> file plus all the other files it references and re-create the same directory structure before opening the <span class="emphasis"><em>.blend</em></span> file. Alternatively, you can “pack” your <span class="emphasis"><em>.blend</em></span> file, which saves external data such as images within the <span class="emphasis"><em>.blend</em></span> file, so that you can then open up the <span class="emphasis"><em>.blend</em></span> file on any machine and have all the data it needs.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Appending and Linking"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="appending_and_linking">Appending and Linking</h3></div></div></div><p>Blender lacks the standard copy-and-paste functionality for objects or other kinds of datablocks that you might expect from using more conventional applications. To copy an object, you can either duplicate it or simply reference the same datablock using an existing object. But what if you want to bring something in from an external <span class="emphasis"><em>.blend</em></span> file?</p><p>That’s where the Append and Link features come in. Appending and linking let you bring datablocks from one <span class="emphasis"><em>.blend</em></span> file into another. Append (File▸Append) brings the datablock wholly into the current <span class="emphasis"><em>.blend</em></span> file as an independent copy of the original. Linking (File▸Link) <span class="emphasis"><em>references</em></span> the original datablock in the other file. Linked datablocks cannot be edited in the .<span class="emphasis"><em>blend</em></span> file they are linked into; rather, they must be edited in the original file.</p><p>Appending is useful for quickly bringing an existing resource into your <span class="emphasis"><em>.blend</em></span> file so that you can use and edit it. Linking is useful for combining multiple elements in larger projects when, for example, different people are editing various parts independently. By linking all the elements of a project into one scene, people can work on parts independently in separate <span class="emphasis"><em>.blend</em></span> files, while keeping the final assembly of multiple linked objects up-to-date. (If you link a datablock and wish to edit it locally, make it into a local datablock using the Make Local operator (<span class="strong"><strong>L</strong></span>).)</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="In Review"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="in_review-id00005">In Review</h2></div></div></div><p>This chapter has offered a basic introduction to Blender. You’ve learned the basics of how to work with Blender’s user interface and essential tools. We looked at its UI terminology and its different editor types, explored the basics of adding and manipulating objects, and discussed how objects and datablocks work in Blender. We also looked at how to save and load files and import elements from one <span class="emphasis"><em>.blend</em></span> file into another.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will move on to learning a little about GIMP, a free open source image-editing program that makes an ideal companion to Blender when you’re working on projects.</p></div></section></body></html>

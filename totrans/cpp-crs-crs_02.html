<p class="quote"><em>First we crawl. Later we crawl on broken glass.</em><br/>—<em>Scott Meyers</em>, Effective STL</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><a href="part01.xhtml#part01">Part I</a> teaches you the crucial concepts in the C++ Core Language. <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1</a> sets up a working environment and bootstraps some language constructs, including the basics of objects, the primary abstraction you use to program C++.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The next five chapters examine objects and types—the heart and soul of C++. Unlike some other programming books, you won’t be building web servers or launching rocket ships from the get-go. All the programs in <a href="part01.xhtml#part01">Part I</a> simply print to the command line. The focus is on building your mental model of the language instead of instant gratification.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="ch02.xhtml">Chapter 2</a> takes an extensive look at types, the language construct that defines your objects.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="ch03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a> extends the discussion of <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a> to discuss reference types, which describe objects that refer to other objects.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="ch04.xhtml">Chapter 4</a> describes the object life cycle, one of the most powerful aspects of C++.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">Chapters 5</a> and <a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06">6</a> explore compile-time polymorphism with templates and runtime polymorphism with interfaces, which allow you to write loosely coupled and highly reusable code.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_2"/>Armed with a foundation in C++’s object model, you’ll be ready to dive into <a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07">Chapters 7</a> through <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09">9</a>. These chapters present expressions, statements, and functions, which you use to get work done in the language. It might seem odd that these language constructs appear at the end of <a href="part01.xhtml#part01">Part I</a>, but without a strong knowledge of objects and their life cycles, all but the most basic features of these language constructs would be impossible to understand.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As a comprehensive, ambitious, powerful language, C++ can overwhelm the newcomer. To make it approachable, <a href="part01.xhtml#part01">Part I</a> is sequential, cohesive, and meant to be read like a story.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="part01.xhtml#part01">Part I</a> is an entry fee. All your hard work learning the C++ Core Language buys you admission into the all-you-can-eat buffet of libraries and frameworks in <a href="part02.xhtml#part02">Part II</a>.</p>&#13;

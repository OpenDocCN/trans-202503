<p class="ChapterIntro">Let’s start by setting up the programming environment we’ll use throughout the rest of the book. Python is flexible enough to run across a number of platforms, so I can’t cover all possible installation and configuration options. That said, because some of the problems we’ll be analyzing can be computationally expensive, I’ll assume you’re using a laptop or desktop to do your experimentation, and not a tablet or phone. A multicore CPU will help speed up some of the processing. While it’s not necessary (and I won’t be using them), some libraries can also leverage modern GPUs, so I encourage you to experiment with them. Finally, several operations can be memory intensive. I recommend having at least 4GB of RAM available, but 8GB or more is preferred. With every environment, you have to balance implementation cost against the time it takes to generate solutions. In <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 13"><a href="c13.xhtml">Chapter 13</a></span> we’ll examine distributing the problem across many smaller platforms. </p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_4" title="4"/>I’ll present two setups: one simple, one advanced. If you’re new to Python programming, I recommend you start out with the simple setup, which uses Anaconda for package and environment management and installs an integrated development environment (IDE) named Spyder. The Spyder IDE is specifically tooled toward mathematical and scientific applications, making it an excellent choice for the upcoming projects. </p>
<p>If you’re familiar with the nuances of environment and package management and already have a Python environment configured, the advanced setup covers using a virtual environment to isolate your experimental workspace from the rest of your production tools, as well as manually installing the required packages.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502567c01-0001">Simple Environment Configuration with Anaconda</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">We’ll start by installing Anaconda, a platform designed for managing multiple Python environments painlessly, even for people who don’t have a background in system administration. Anaconda will make it easy to install the packages we need, update them over time, and ensure environment dependencies remain consistent. Anaconda has been specifically designed for data science and machine learning workflows. There are installers available for Linux, Windows, and macOS. Head to the Anaconda distribution page (<a class="LinkURL" href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution">https://www.anaconda.com/distribution</a>) and download the most recent installer version for your platform. </p>
<p>Now let’s walk through the instructions for Linux, Windows, and macOS.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502567c01-0001">Linux </h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">The download you receive from the Anaconda link is actually a shell script to assist in downloading and configuring the necessary packages. You should <em>not</em> run this script as a privileged user (like <code>su</code> on Debian, for instance). Start by opening a terminal in the directory where the install script is located. You can execute the installer with the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>$ <b>chmod +x </b><var class="bold">Anaconda3-202X.0X-Linux-x86_64.sh</var><b>;</b>
$ <var class="bold">./Anaconda3-202X.0X-Linux-x86_64.sh</var><b>;</b></code></pre>
<p>To begin the installation, you need to mark this script as executable using <code>chmod +x</code>. Make sure to change the name of the script to match the version you downloaded. You can then run the installer using the default shell interpreter. During setup you’ll be asked to confirm a few installation options. In most cases, the default options are good enough. If you plan to change any of the defaults, take the time to read the documentation—some options can have unforeseen consequences. After the installation completes, you can verify everything is working using the newly installed conda utility. Open a new terminal and issue this command:</p>
<pre><code>$ <b>conda info </b></code></pre>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_5" title="5"/>You should see output similar to the following:</p>
<pre><code>     active environment : base
    active env location : /home/dreilly/anaconda3
            shell level : 1
       user config file : /home/dreilly/.condarc
 populated config files : 
          conda version : 23.<var>X</var>
    conda-build version : not installed
         python version : 3.<var>X</var>
       virtual packages : __glibc=2.23
       base environment : /home/dreilly/anaconda3  (writable)
           channel URLs : https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main/linux-64
                          https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/main/noarch
          package cache : /home/dreilly/anaconda3/pkgs
                          /home/dreilly/.conda/pkgs
       envs directories : /home/dreilly/anaconda3/envs
                          /home/dreilly/.conda/envs
               platform : linux-64
             user-agent : <var>&lt;platform-user-agent-string&gt;</var>
                UID:GID : 1000:1000
             netrc file : None
           offline mode : False</code></pre>
<p>There’s some good information here. First, there’s <code>user config file</code>, the location of the user configuration file. Editing this file will allow you to personalize Anaconda; it’s worth looking into if you plan to do a lot of work in it. The next two pieces are <code>conda version</code> and <code>python version</code>. Compare <code>conda version</code> against the latest available Anaconda version to ensure you have the most up-to-date tools possible. The <code>python version</code> is the default Python interpreter that Anaconda will use when creating environments. You can set specific Python versions for each environment, but ensuring your default is set to your preferred version can save you some time if you forget to specify a version when you create an environment. </p>
<p>The <code>channel URLs</code> field tells you the remote locations conda will check when trying to install new packages. Be careful when modifying this list. Adding untrusted source repositories poses a security risk if an attacker replaces a legitimate package like pandas with a malicious version. It’s also a good idea to audit this field from time to time to make sure it doesn’t include any unrecognized channels. The <code>package cache</code> field shows you where Anaconda will store package information for the libraries it has installed. Since multiple environments will likely request the same version of packages, Anaconda builds a cache of the known packages to speed up future installations and reduce creation times for similar environments. The final piece to take note of is the <code>envs directories</code> field, which tells you where on the system Anaconda will store the files related to defining each environment, including a copy of the package versions installed for each. Knowing where this information is stored will come in handy if you have to troubleshoot a package conflict in a specific environment (although conda has tools to help with this as well).</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_6" title="6"/>At this point, your base environment is set up and you’re ready to configure your research environment. You can skip to the “<span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Setting Up a Virtual Environment"><a href="#h1-502567c01-0002">Setting Up a Virtual Environment</a></span>” section later in the chapter. </p>
<h3 id="h2-502567c01-0002">Windows</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">When you run the Anaconda install script for a Windows machine, you’ll be greeted with a typical Windows-style install prompt, similar to <a href="#figure1-1" id="figureanchor1-1">Figure 1-1</a>. </p>
<figure>
<img alt="" class="keyline" src="image_fi/502567c01/f01001_NEW.png"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure1-1">Figure 1-1</a>: The Anaconda installer on Windows</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Select the directory where you’d like the base application to reside. If your system has a large secondary drive and a small primary solid-state drive (SSD), make sure you install Anaconda on the larger drive. With multiple environments and interpreters and package versions, it can grow quite big over time.</p>
<p>The rest of the installer will walk you through configuring Anaconda. The defaults are typically fine for most cases. If you plan to change any of the defaults, take the time to read the documentation—some options can have unforeseen consequences. You may need to give the installer permission to make changes (via the User Account Control pop-up). In some instances you may get an error message when the GUI attempts to start. You can often fix this issue by explicitly telling conda where to find the proper executable. Open a run prompt (you can use the key combination <span class="KeyCaps">win-</span>R on most keyboards), type <code class="bold">cmd.exe</code>, and then press <span class="KeyCaps">enter</span>. Navigate to the <em>scripts</em> subdirectory inside the directory where you installed Anaconda. If you used the install directory in <a href="#figure1-1">Figure 1-1</a>, for example, the path to the scripts <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_7" title="7"/>directory would be <em>C:\Users\IEUser\anaconda3\scripts</em>. Move into that folder like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ <b>cd </b><var class="bold">C:\Users\IEUser\anaconda3\scripts</var></code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">Then run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>$ <b>activate root</b>
$ <b>conda update -n root conda</b></code></pre>
<p>The first command tells Anaconda to activate the root environment, which is created during installation and contains the default Python version and some basic packages. The second command tells Anaconda to update the root environment’s version of the conda application. You’ll be asked to confirm the update by pressing Y, and then Anaconda will install the latest version of conda. Finally, you can update all the packages in the root environment using the updated version of conda like so:</p>
<pre><code>$ <b>conda update --all</b></code></pre>
<p>Once again, you’ll be asked to confirm the update by pressing Y. After the setup and updates have completed, you can access an Anaconda Navigator interface similar to the one in <a href="#figure1-2" id="figureanchor1-2">Figure 1-2</a>.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="" class="keyline" src="image_fi/502567c01/f01002.png"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure1-2">Figure 1-2</a>: The Anaconda Navigator interface</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Navigator interface can be used for package management, virtual environment management, and more. It’s the command center for administering your Anaconda installation. Even though Windows installations do have access to the conda utility (it’s what the GUI relies on under the hood, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_8" title="8"/>after all), most never need to use it directly since all the most useful tools have been wrapped in a pleasant interface. One benefit of the Windows install is how easy it is to create virtual environments. Simply click the <b>Environments</b> tab and then click <b>Create</b>. Enter a name for your new environment and pick the appropriate interpreter. That’s it! Now you can skip to the “<span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Setting Up a Virtual Environment"><a href="#h1-502567c01-0002">Setting Up a Virtual Environment</a></span>” section.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502567c01-0003">macOS</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">When you run the <em>.pkg</em> file downloaded from the Anaconda link, you should see something like <a href="#figure1-3" id="figureanchor1-3">Figure 1-3</a>.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="" class="keyline" src="image_fi/502567c01/f01003.png"/>
<figcaption><p><a id="figure1-3">Figure 1-3</a>: The Anaconda installation screen</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The rest of the installer will walk you through configuring Anaconda. The defaults are typically fine for most cases. If you plan to change any of the defaults, take the time to read the documentation—some options can have unforeseen consequences. </p>
<p>Note that the recommended IDE (Spyder, covered shortly) isn’t natively supported under macOS. It’s available using the port package manager, though. If you’re on a macOS system, you can elect to skip the Spyder setup described in this chapter and choose a Python IDE specifically designed for use with your system. None of Spyder’s advanced features are necessary to view or run the code examples, so any modern IDE should suffice.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502567c01-0002"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_9" title="9"/>Setting Up a Virtual Environment</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Anyone who has worked in Python for long enough has seen the inevitable chaos that comes from working on too many projects in one space. Different packages will require different versions of the same dependency. One project requires a different interpreter than another. It can be a real mess, and one you typically won’t notice until it’s too late and you’re spending the weekend resolving your poor choices. </p>
<p>To avoid all the headache and lost time, you can simply break your projects up into separate virtual environments. You can think of a virtual environment as an isolated Python world. Packages in one virtual environment are blissfully unaware of packages in other virtual environments. Interpreters are automatically changed to the proper one for the environment. Life is once again harmonious. In your preferred terminal, enter the following command to have conda create a new environment for your projects.</p>
<pre><code>$ <b>conda create -n </b><var class="bold">env_name</var><code> </code><b>python=3.</b><var class="bold">X</var><b> anaconda</b></code></pre>
<p>Here <var>env_name</var> is the name you want to give your environment; change this to suit your preference. You can specify a Python version using the <code>python=</code><var>version</var> syntax. The example will configure a Python 3.<em>X</em> interpreter as the default for your new environment. Press Y to proceed. Anaconda will make a copy of the Python interpreter and all the associated libraries to the <em>environments</em> subdirectory. The exact path to this directory will depend on your OS and where you installed Anaconda. On my system, the path to this environment becomes <em>/home/dreilly/anaconda3/envs/researchenv/</em>. </p>
<p>Take a moment now to locate this directory and make a note of the full path to the folder. You’ll need this in a few minutes to properly configure the IDE. To activate your new virtual environment and begin working within it, issue the following command in your terminal: </p>
<pre><code>$ <b>conda activate </b><var class="bold">env_name</var></code></pre>
<p>When you activate an Anaconda virtual environment, the management application modifies your operating system’s underlying environment variables to accommodate the separation between projects. The <code>PATH</code>, <code>PYTHONPATH</code>, and other variables are updated to point at the specific isolated Python setup you’ve created. Your terminal prompt should change to tell you which virtual environment you’re currently working in. You may also want to verify the setup by checking the <code>conda info</code> command. </p>
<pre><code>$ <b>conda info -e</b></code></pre>
<p>The result should be a list of all the virtual environments you currently have defined with an asterisk next to the currently active environment.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502567c01-0003"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_10" title="10"/>Installing the IDE with Anaconda</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Spyder (<a class="LinkURL" href="https://www.spyder-ide.org">https://www.spyder-ide.org</a>) is a scientific and mathematics programming environment written in Python, for Python. It’s been designed by a dedicated group of programmers, scientists, engineers, and data analysts to meet the demands of their work. The best part about the Spyder IDE is the fact that it comes available through Anaconda. You can install it from your terminal with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>$ <b>conda install -c anaconda spyder</b></code></pre>
<p>Once the install completes, you can run the IDE from the console with the command <code>spyder</code>.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve set up the virtual and coding environments, you’re almost ready! You can give yourself two cool points and skip to the “<span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Jupyter Notebooks"><a href="#h1-502567c01-0005">Jupyter Notebooks</a></span>” section of this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502567c01-0004">Advanced Setup</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Using the following setup, you can isolate your experimental work from your production workspace using virtual environments. It assumes you’ve already installed Python 3 correctly on your system and you’re familiar with using the pip utility to install packages. A <em>setup.py</em> script is provided in this book’s GitHub repository for your convenience.</p>
<h3 id="h2-502567c01-0004">Setting Up virtualenv</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">The virtualenv is a Python package manager for isolating different projects’ dependencies. Using virtualenv allows you to avoid installing Python packages globally, which could break system tools or lead to inconsistent dependent libraries in other projects. You’ll be installing virtualenv using the pip utility. Enter the following command in your terminal:</p>
<pre><code>$ <b>python -m pip install --user virtualenv</b></code></pre>
<p>Depending on your install, on Windows machines, you may need to change the command to the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ <b>py -m pip install --user virtualenv</b></code></pre>
<p>After installing the virtualenv module, you can create the environment. The details of this process have changed over the years, but the idea remains the same. Since Python 3.9 this is the preferred method to create virtual environments:</p>
<pre><code>$ <b>python -m venv </b><var class="bold">path_to_new_environment</var></code></pre>

<h3 id="h2-502567c01-0005">Installing the IDE without Anaconda</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">You can install the Spyder IDE in many different ways depending on the platform you operate on. Debian Linux users may be interested in installing via apt-get instead of Anaconda. Spyder’s official Debian package is available on the Debian package repository:</p>
<pre><code>$ <b>sudo apt-get install spyder3</b></code></pre>
<p>This will install the spyder3 application to <em>/usr/bin/anaconda3</em>. You can verify this location with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>$ <b>which spyder3</b></code></pre>
<p>It’s possible to install Spyder using pip, but it’s not recommended (it can get quite complex). See the Spyder installation guide (<a class="LinkURL" href="https://docs.spyder-ide.org/installation.html">https://docs.spyder-ide.org/installation.html</a>) for more information.</p>
<p>If you’re on Windows you can get the Spyder IDE, along with a suite of other useful libraries, within the Anaconda Navigator. Under the Home tab you’ll see a sample of applications that integrate with Anaconda. Click <b>Install</b> under the Spyder application to begin the process. Once the installation is complete, the Install button will be replaced with a Launch button that will start the IDE.</p>
<p>WinPython (<a class="LinkURL" href="https://winpython.github.io">https://winpython.github.io</a>) is another scientific Python distribution that is similar to Anaconda in that it includes all the most sought-after scientific packages and utility libraries. One notable difference, though, is the lack of a package management tool like Anaconda’s conda utility. It’s this lack of beginner-friendly tooling that ultimately made me decide to use Anaconda for this book. If you’re already using WinPython you’ll be able to follow along with the projects, but if you’re starting a brand-new environment I highly recommend going the Anaconda route.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502567c01-0005">Jupyter Notebooks</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Congratulations—at this point your development environment is complete! There’s one more tool, however, that you can optionally install to get the most out of this book: the Jupyter notebook server. Several of the projects in this book are accompanied by interactive Jupyter notebooks that include more detail about the mathematical formulas, discussions about creating the graphics used in the text, and pieces of template code you can use to speed up your own application development. If you followed the Anaconda setup on Debian Linux, I have good news: you already have the Jupyter notebook server installed. If you installed Anaconda under Windows, you <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_12" title="12"/>can use the Anaconda Navigator to get the application. Navigate to the <b>Home</b> tab and click <b>Install</b> under the Jupyter Notebook app. Once the Install button changes to a Launch button, you’re ready. </p>
<p>You can also install Jupyter in your virtual environment manually with the following pip commands:</p>
<pre><code>$ <b>pip install --upgrade pip</b>
$ <b>pip install jupyter</b></code></pre>
<p class="BodyContinued">You can then start a notebook server from the terminal using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>$ <b>jupyter notebook</b></code></pre>
<p>Or on Windows you can simply start the notebook server using the Anaconda Navigator GUI as I mentioned before. Either way, Jupyter will open a web browser that displays the contents of the directory where you ran the command. You can use the web interface to create new notebooks or open existing ones. </p>
<p>If you’re new to the concept of interactive notebooks, I urge you to take this opportunity to learn what they’re all about. Jupyter is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, visualizations, and text formatted in HTML or the more compact Markdown syntax. By combining Markdown, code, and output, we can automatically generate beautiful reports, informative analysis, and working proofs of concept all in one place. Code snippets can be run independently, but data persists between code in different blocks (called <em>cells</em>). </p>
<p>I regularly use notebooks while I’m writing and testing individual functions for a project because I can configure the variables once and then repeatedly test the function without needing to rerun any other code. As you’ll see, I also used them extensively when writing these chapters to generate most of the figures and code blocks. Being able to run certain pieces of code independently came in handy when I was tweaking and rendering the figures.</p>
<h2 id="h1-502567c01-0006">Summary</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Planning and building a solid Python environment may not be the most exciting reading topic in the world, but making sure all your tools are in place and ready to work will make jumping into the rest of the book much simpler. Whether you chose to go the simple route with Anaconda or the more advanced route with virtualenv, you should now have an isolated area to follow along with the code in the upcoming projects. In the next chapter, we’ll finish our last bit of housekeeping by clearing up some of the programmatic and mathematical syntax used throughout the rest of the book. If you’re already very comfortable with Python and know your sigmas from your deltas, feel free to skip ahead to <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 3"><a href="c03.xhtml">Chapter 3</a></span>.</p>

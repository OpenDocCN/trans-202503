  zh: 通常，只有系统管理员可以查看日志。通常，系统用户无法修改日志，除非是写入日志。例如，在特定用户上下文下运行的应用程序通常有权限向系统或应用程序日志写入消息。请记住，收集日志而不查看它们是毫无意义的。如果你从不查看日志内容，那么收集它们就等同于没有收集它们。定期检查日志，以便发现其中任何不寻常的内容，是非常重要的。
- en: You may also be asked, in the course of normal security duties, to analyze the
    contents of logs in relation to an incident or situation. In the case of investigations,
    incidents, and compliance checks, these types of activities often fall to security
    personnel. Reviewing logs can be a difficult task if the period in question is
    greater than a few days. Even searching the contents of a relatively simple log,
    such as that generated by a web proxy server, can mean sifting through enormous
    amounts of data. In such cases, custom scripts or even a tool such as grep (a
    UNIX and Linux tool for searching text) can help accomplish the task in a reasonable
    amount of time.

- en: A subset of auditing, *monitoring* is observing information about an environment
    to discover undesirable conditions such as failures, resource shortages, and security
    issues, as well as trends that might signal the arrival of such conditions. Like
    logging, monitoring is largely a reactive activity; it takes action based on gathered
    data, typically from logs generated by various devices. Even when you’re trying
    to predict future events, you’re still relying on past data to do so.

  zh: 审计的一个子集，*监控*是观察环境信息以发现不良情况，如故障、资源短缺和安全问题，以及可能预示这些情况到来的趋势。像日志记录一样，监控在很大程度上是一个反应性活动；它根据收集到的数据采取行动，通常是来自各种设备生成的日志。即使你试图预测未来的事件，你仍然依赖过去的数据来实现这一点。
- en: When monitoring a system, you’re typically watching for specific kinds or patterns
    of data, such as increased resource usage on computers, unusual network latency
    (the time it takes a packet to get from one point to another on a network), certain
    types of attacks occurring repeatedly against servers with network interfaces
    that are exposed to the internet, traffic passing through your physical access
    controls at unusual times of day, and so on.

- en: When you detect unusual levels of such activity, called the *clipping level*,
    your monitoring system might send an alert to a system administrator or physical
    security personnel, or it might trigger a more direct action, such as dropping
    traffic from a particular IP address, switching to a backup system for a critical

- en: 'As mentioned, logging and monitoring are reactive measures. To assess the state
    of your systems more actively, you might use a kind of audit called *assessments*,
    which are tests that find and fix vulnerabilities before any attackers do. If
    you can conduct assessments successfully and on a recurring basis, you will considerably
    increase your security posture and stand a much better chance of resisting attacks.
    You can take two approaches to this: vulnerability assessments and penetration
    testing. While people often use these terms interchangeably, they are two distinct

    tools, such as Qualys,[⁶](notes.xhtml#ch04fn6) shown in [Figure 4-2](#ch4fig2),

    the target systems to discover open ports and then interrogating each open port
    to find out exactly which service is listening on it. Additionally, you may choose
    to provide credentials, if you have them, to allow a vulnerability scanner to
    authenticate to the device in question and collect considerably more detailed

    and the information contained in or regarding files.'

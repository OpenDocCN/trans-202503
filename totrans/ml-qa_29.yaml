- en: We usually use Poisson regression when the target variable represents count
    data (positive integers). As an example of count data, consider the number of
    colds contracted on an airplane or the number of guests visiting a restaurant
    on a given day. Besides the target variable representing counts, the data should
    also be Poisson distributed, which means that the mean and variance are roughly
    the same. (For large means, we can use a normal distribution to approximate a
    Poisson distribution.)

- en: '*Ordinal data* is a subcategory of categorical data where the categories have
    a natural order, such as 1 < 2 < 3, as illustrated in [Figure 24-1](ch24.xhtml#ch24fig1).
    Ordinal data is often represented as positive integers and may look similar to
    count data. For example, consider the star rating on Amazon (1 star, 2 stars,
    3 stars, and so on). However, ordinal regression does not make any assumptions
    about the distance between the ordered categories. Consider the following measure
    of disease severity: *severe > moderate > mild > none*. While we would typically
    map the disease severity variable to an integer representation (4 > 3 > 2 > 1),
    there is no assumption that the distance between 4 and 3 (severe and moderate)
    is the same as the distance between 2 and 1 (mild and none).'

- en: In short, we use Poisson regression for count data. We use ordinal regression
    when we know that certain outcomes are “higher” or “lower” than others, but we
    are not sure how much or if it even matters.

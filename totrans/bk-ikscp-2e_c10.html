			</header>
			<p class="ChapterIntro"><a id="175"/>Gradients are important in vector graphics because they are the cheapest and most universal way to depart
from the lifeless flat look of solid color fills. Designers can create 
amazingly complex and photorealistic art using nothing
but carefully laid out gradients. For all their versatility, gradients are relatively
simple to create and edit, render quickly,
and they are almost universally supported in SVG
software—none of which is quite true, for example, for SVG filters such as blur
(<a href="c17.xhtml#section17.1">17.1</a>).</p>
			<p>
				Basically, a <em>gradient</em> is a smooth transition between two or more colors. <em>Color</em>
also includes a level of opacity; this means that you can, for example, make a gradient
from opaque red to transparent red, with semitransparent red shades in between. SVG
supports two types of gradients: <em>linear</em> (along a line) and <em>elliptic</em>, or<em>radial</em> (away from a center, with possibly unequal <em>axes</em> and a noncentral<em>focus point</em>).</p>
			<p>
				After the plain linear and elliptic gradients, this chapter describes the <em>mesh gradients</em>
that are much more powerful and flexible—even though, unfortunately, they are not supported by
other SVG software at the moment. Finally, I discuss <em>patterns</em> that paint an object with repeated copies
of another object; patterns have many similarities to gradients in the user interface.</p>
			<a id="section10.1"/><h2>
				10.1 <a id="176"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_176" title="176"/>Creating Gradients</h2>
			<p>
				The Gradient tool (G or Ctrl-F1) is where you create new
gradients on objects. It is also the most natural place to <em>edit</em> existing
gradients—although, once created, an object's gradient handles are also visible
(so they can be dragged and colored) in the Node tool (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.5">12.5</a>), all
shape tools (<a href="c11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11</a>), and the
Dropper tool (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.8">8.8</a>).</p>
			<p>
				Creating a new gradient is easy. Just make sure you have the 
object (or objects) selected and start dragging on the canvas—from the selected object
or from any point nearby. You will see an actual gradient appearing and following your mouse as
you drag, and you will also see a system of <em>handles</em> (small on-canvas controls) connected by lines.</p>
			<p>
				You don't need to drag <em>on</em> the selected objects—gradient handles can very
well lie completely outside the object they apply to. You can select any number of objects
and paint them all with the same gradient (more precisely, with multiple but
coinciding gradients) with a single drag. Another way to quickly create a gradient
that spans the entire object is to double-click that object with the Gradient tool.</p>
			<p>To use the most common object selection shortcuts, you don't need to switch
to the Selector tool: click to select, Alt-click to select under, and
Shift-click to add to selection all work in the Gradient tool as
well.</p>
			<p>
				You can apply a gradient to the <em>fill</em> of an object, its <em>stroke</em>, or both
(<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.2">8.2</a>). In Inkscape, a stroke gradient shows a pink connecting
line between the handles, while a fill gradient has a blue line, as shown in <a href="#fig10-1">Figure 10-1</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig10-1"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="11/gradient-fillstroke.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 10-1: Different gradients on the fill and stroke
of an object</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				If you are creating a gradient on an object that had flat color paint before, the
initial gradient will go from the fully opaque to the fully transparent color of
the object <em>on which you started the drag</em>. For example, if you have a yellow
rectangle selected and start your drag on that rectangle, you will fill the object with
a gradient going from opaque yellow to transparent yellow. You can, however, fill it
with an opaque-blue-to-transparent-blue gradient if you have a blue-filled object
somewhere and start dragging from it. To put it another way, the gradient you create
applies to selected objects, but the color it uses may come from any object, selected or
not, from which you start your drag. (If that's not what you wanted, don't worry—it's
very easy to change gradient colors once it's created.)</p>
			<p><a id="177"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_177" title="177"/>Similarly, if the object where you started your drag already had some gradient, the
tool will redraw it for the selected object, preserving the colors of that gradient
(that is, preserving the <em>gradient definition</em>, <a href="#section10.2">10.2</a>).
If you start dragging from an empty space, not from any object, the color or gradient of the <em>topmost
selected</em> object will be used for the new gradient.</p>
			<p>
				Of the many ways to <em>remove</em> gradients from an object, the easiest is to
make sure none of the gradient handles are selected (all are white, not blue; if some are blue, press Escape once) and click
any color on the palette (or Shift-click to remove gradient from stroke). The object will be filled or stroked by the flat color,
replacing any gradient it had before.</p>
			<p>
				When you transform (that is, move, scale, rotate, or skew, <a href="c06.xhtml#ch6">Chapter 6</a>) an
object that uses gradients on fill or stroke, all the gradient handles are transformed along
with the object, so the gradient stays firmly put in place. However, the third <span class="ui">Affect</span> button on the Selector tool controls bar (<a href="c06.xhtml#section6.11">6.11</a>) can change that.
If you uncheck this button (checked by default), gradients will remain fixed <em>relative
to the canvas</em>, no matter how you transform the objects that use them. This can be
useful, for example, if you want to scale an object up or down so that its size matches exactly
the elliptic gradient it uses.</p>

			<p>Let's now look in more detail at the two types of gradients Inkscape can create:
linear and elliptic.</p>
			<a id="section10.1.1"/><h3>10.1.1 Linear Gradients</h3>
			<p>
				A linear gradient goes along a straight line segment, and both ends of the segment (as well as,
possibly, some points in the middle) have certain colors and opacities assigned to
them. The transitions between color areas on the object are always perpendicular to the
gradient line. This is the default kind of gradient that the Gradient tool creates; the
linear gradient mode of the tool corresponds to the first toggle button on the tool's
controls bar (<a href="#fig10-2">Figure 10-2</a>).</p>

			<p>A linear gradient has two freely draggable handles: a square at the start
and a circle at the end of the gradient line. By dragging them around, you can
change the direction and length of the gradient. The gradient repaints itself
in real time as you drag a handle.</p>
			<p>
				With Ctrl pressed, drawing a new gradient or dragging a handle of an
existing one makes the gradient line <em>snap</em> to angle increments, by default every
15 degrees (you can change this value in the <span class="ui">Behavior<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Steps</span>
page of the <span class="ui">Preferences</span> dialog, compare <a href="c06.xhtml#section6.3">6.3</a>).
Double-clicking an object in linear gradient mode creates a horizontal
linear gradient that goes through the center of the object's bounding box.</p>
			<a id="section10.1.2"/><h3>10.1.2 Elliptic Gradients</h3>
			<p>
				To switch the Gradient tool to create <em>elliptic gradients</em> instead of linear,
click the second toggle button in the tool's controls bar (above the canvas). Now, if
you drag on canvas with some objects selected, an elliptic gradient will be created
on those objects, as shown in <a href="#fig10-3">Figure 10-3</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig10-3"/><figure>

			<p>
				An elliptic gradient has at least three draggable handles—the <em>center</em> (square
handle) and the two perpendicular <em>radii</em> (circular handles). These handles let you
move, stretch, squeeze, or rotate the gradient; you can make it into anything from
a circle to a narrow ellipse, rotated at any angle. Moving the center handle moves the
entire gradient (all handles); moving the radii stretches and rotates the gradient
without moving the center. The two radii always remain perpendicular. As with a linear
gradient, dragging a radius with Ctrl pressed <em>snaps</em> it to 15-degree angle increments.</p>
			<p>
				When you start dragging to create a new gradient, you mark its center and are dragging out one of the radii. The
other radius is created to be equal to half of the selected object's height—that is,
if you start dragging from the center of the object and drag horizontally to the right
edge of its bounding box, the ellipse <a id="179"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_179" title="179"/>will be neatly inscribed into the bounding
box. You can achieve the same effect simply by double-clicking an object.</p>

					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>If you need a symmetric "bilinear" gradient with a mountain-like profile, an
easy way to create it is via an elliptic gradient with one radius made very long,
dragged far beyond the boundaries of the object. Then, the central part of the stretched
ellipse will look almost indistinguishable from a couple counter-directed linear
gradients.</p>
					<div class="bottom hr">
						<hr/>
					</div>
				</section>
			</aside>
			<p>
				An elliptic gradient also has a fourth, normally hidden, handle: the<em>focus</em>. This is the point with the color and opacity of the gradient's central
stop. Normally, it is merged together with the central handle and moves with it,
keeping the gradient perfectly symmetric.  To separate the
focus—visualized by an X-shaped handle—from the center, drag away from the central
handle with Shift. This creates an asymmetric, or <em>eccentric</em>, gradient (<a href="#fig10-4">Figure 10-4</a>). To merge
the focus back, just drag it close enough to the central handle and it will snap.</p>

			</figure>
			<a id="section10.2"/>
			<h2>10.2 Gradient Definition</h2>
			<p>
				A gradient has a set of <em>stops</em>, each with its own color and transparency
value. The minimum number of stops is the two <em>end stops</em>:
the ends of the gradient line (linear) or the center and edge of an ellipse
(elliptic). However, a gradient can also have any number of <em>middle stops</em>
positioned somewhere between the end stops. For example, you may have a single middle stop
at 0.5 of the gradient, which means it will always be exactly in the middle between the
end stops. The complete list of a gradient's stops with their colors, transparencies, and
relative positions is called the <em>gradient definition</em>.</p>
			<p>
				Gradient definitions are document-wide resources. This means that any gradient you
create or edit adds its definition to the list of all gradient definitions in your
document. After that, you can assign that definition to any other gradient in this
document, which means that gradient will take the colors and the relative positions
of the middle stops from the definition (but the gradient's end handles will not move).
The same gradient definition can be used by both linear and elliptic gradients.
Use the drop-down list in the controls bar of the Gradient tool to view and select gradient
definitions in the document (<a href="#fig10-5">Figure 10-5</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig10-5"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="11/gradient-definition.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 10-5: Choosing a gradient definition</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The same list of gradient swatches is also available in the <span class="ui">Fill and Stroke</span>
dialog as well as in the <span class="ui">Paint Servers</span> dialog (<a href="#section10.9">10.9</a>).
When you have one or more objects with gradients selected, choosing a definition
from the list assigns it to all selected gradients.</p>
			<p><a id="180"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_180" title="180"/>You can <em>reverse</em> the color definition of the selected object's gradient by
pressing Shift-R or clicking the <span class="ui">Reverse direction</span> button on the controls bar. For example, if you have an elliptic gradient with opaque
blue in the center and transparent yellow at the edge, after pressing Shift-R you will
have transparent yellow in the center and opaque blue at the edge. With a linear
gradient, this is equivalent to rotating the gradient line by 180 degrees, but an
elliptic gradient can't be reversed simply by moving its handles, which makes
Shift-R indispensable.</p>
			<a id="section10.2.1"/><h3>10.2.1 Sharing Gradient Definitions</h3>
			<p>
				When copy-and-pasting or duplicating an object with a gradient, the object's copy
automatically gets a <em>copy of the original gradient</em>, so that modifying it does not
affect the source object's gradient definition. This behavior is controlled by the<span class="ui">Prevent sharing of gradient definitions</span> checkbox on the <span class="ui">Tools<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Gradient</span> page of
the <span class="ui">Preferences</span> dialog. It is checked by default; if you uncheck it, 
copy-and-pasting, duplicating, pasting style, and explicit assignment of an existing
gradient definition to an object will result in a <em>shared</em> gradient definition.
When two objects share a gradient definition,
changing the colors/opacities or middle stop positions of the gradient on one object
affects <em>all</em> the objects that use the same definition.
However, moving the end handles always affects only a single gradient because these
nodes' positions are not part of a gradient definition.</p>
			<p>Another setting that affects sharing of gradient definitions during object duplication is the
lock button on the Gradient tool's controls bar. If it is pressed, the next duplication of an object
with a gradient will result in a shared gradient, so that editing a gradient in one of the objects
affects the other object as well. If you unpress the button, editing one of the shared gradients
immediately breaks the link to the other (and pressing the button again will not restore it).</p>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Clean Up Document</span> command in the <span class="ui">File</span> menu removes, among
other things, any leftover unused gradient definitions that may be lingering in your
document. It's a good way to tidy things up and reduce the document size
(sometimes significantly).</p>
			<a id="section10.3"/><h2>10.3 Gradient Repeat</h2>
			<p>
				As you've seen, gradient handles don't need to coincide with the edges of the object they
apply to; they can be positioned absolutely anywhere on the canvas, and the object will just
display whatever part of the gradient happens to fall <a id="181"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_181" title="181"/>within its limits. But what about
those parts of the object that are not covered by the gradient—those that lie beyond
the ends of a linear gradient or outside the edge of an elliptic one?</p>
			<p>By default, these areas are painted by the flat color and transparency of the first or last
gradient stop. For example, if you have a small elliptic gradient with
semitransparent white at the radii, the rest of the object outside the gradient will be
the same semitransparent white. However, this is not the only possibility.</p>
			<p>
				Select an object with a gradient (but make sure none of the handles are
selected) and in the <span class="ui"><strong>Repeat</strong></span> list in the controls bar of the Gradient tool,
select either <span class="ui"><strong>Reflected</strong></span> or <span class="ui"><strong>Direct</strong></span> instead of the default<span class="ui"><strong>None</strong></span>. These options force the gradient to repeat itself indefinitely, either
unchanged (direct) or with an inversion of every second copy (reflected). This is an easy
way to create various striped patterns on objects, as shown in <a href="#fig10-6">Figure 10-6</a>.</p>

			<a id="section10.4"/>
			<h2>10.4 Gradient Handles</h2>
			<p>
				Handles are the on-canvas controls that correspond to the gradient stops. In the Gradient tool,
they can be not only dragged around but also <em>selected</em> and <em>painted</em>,
much the same as selected objects are painted.</p>
			<a id="section10.4.1"/><h3>10.4.1 Selecting</h3>
			<p>
				Selected handles are blue; unselected ones are white.  The simplest
way to select a handle is by clicking it; you can also
Shift-click to add a handle to selection or remove it from selection, or
Shift-drag around multiple nodes to select them with a rubber band
(compare <a href="c05.xhtml#section5.7">5.7</a>). After you have created a new gradient by
dragging, the handle you've been dragging remains selected.</p>
			<p>
				Similar to the Selector, in the Gradient tool you can also select handles with the keyboard.
Tab and Shift-Tab select the <em>next</em> and <em>previous</em> handle
(or first and last, if none were selected before); Ctrl-A selects <em>all</em>
handles (in all selected objects); and Escape deselects any handles (but leaves the
objects selected; a second Escape deselects objects).</p>

			<h3>
				10.4.2 <a id="182"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_182" title="182"/>Painting Gradient Stops</h3>
			<p>
				You can assign any color or opacity level to the selected gradient handle or
handles using all the same methods you would use to change the style of an object
(<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.1">8.1</a>). When a handle is selected, the palette, the <span class="ui">Fill and Stroke</span> dialog,
the color gestures and commands in the selected style indicator (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.2">8.2</a>), the <span class="ui">Paste
Style</span> command, and even the Dropper tool all work on the selected handle, not the
selected object. <a href="#fig10-7">Figure 10-7</a> shows an example.</p>
			<a id="fig10-7"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="11/gradient-paint.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 10-7: Assigning color to selected gradient
handles</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Unlike an object, a gradient stop does not have fill or stroke (even though
the gradient itself can apply to fill or stroke). Therefore, when you have one or more
stops selected, the style indicator in the status bar shows the color of the stop in<em>both</em> the fill and stroke swatches; this may not be perfectly logical, but it is handy. The
opacity of a gradient stop is indicated by the master opacity control (labeled<span class="ui">O:</span> in the status bar). The displayed stroke <em>width</em>, however, is always that of
the object (if it has stroke), not the stop, since a stop cannot have a stroke.</p>
			<p>It is convenient to use the Dropper tool if you want one end of the
gradient to blend smoothly into other objects; make sure the corresponding handle is
selected, switch to Dropper, and click the area into which you want it to
blend. Note that by switching to the Dropper tool, you leave the Gradient tool, but
this is not a problem; like many other tools, Dropper displays gradient handles and even
preserves handle selection. You cannot select objects in Dropper, but you can 
switch gradient handle selection.</p>
			<p>
				When <em>multiple</em> gradient handles are selected, the selected style indicator
displays the <em>averaged</em> color and opacity of the selected stops, marked with <span class="ui">a</span>
(this is the same behavior as for multiple selected objects, <a href="c08.xhtml#section8.4.1">8.4.1</a>).</p>
			<p>
				When at least one handle is selected, the <span class="ui">Copy</span> command (Ctrl-C)
copies to the clipboard the style (both color and opacity) of the single selected
handle, or the averaged style of several selected handles. This means you can copy and
paste style between gradient stops—select a handle, copy, select some other handle(s),
and paste style (Shift-Ctrl-V). If you select several handles, this allows you
to quickly average their colors and opacities by copying and then pasting their averaged style
back onto them.</p>
			<p>
				By the way, if you want to change the opacity of <em>all</em> stops in a gradient by the same
amount, you don't need to tweak the opacity of each stop separately. Instead, simply adjust the master
opacity of the object that is using the gradient (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.3">8.3</a>).</p>
			<a id="section10.4.3"/><h3>
				10.4.3 <a id="183"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_183" title="183"/>Moving, Merging, and Snapping</h3>
			<p>
				You can <em>move</em> the selected gradient handles by directly dragging them with the
mouse or by using the arrow keys with all the regular modifiers (Shift for
10 times the standard 2 px displacement, Alt for pixel-size displacement,
Shift-Alt for 10 pixels displacement; see <a href="c06.xhtml#section6.5.1">6.5.1</a>). Naturally, the end stop
handles (gradient ends in a linear, center and radii in an elliptic) can be moved
arbitrarily, whereas the middle handles can be moved only along the gradient
line. (Don't confuse the <em>middle</em> handles with the <em>center</em> handle of an elliptic
gradient; the latter, despite being in the center of an ellipse, represents an <em>end
stop</em> of the gradient definition.)</p>
			<p>If you select multiple objects, all of them that have gradients (linear or elliptic, on fill or on stroke)
will display their handles, and you can edit any of them simultaneously. This opens up interesting
possibilities. For example, you can select the ends of all linear gradients and move them
all in parallel. Or you can press Ctrl-A to select all stops in all
gradients and use arrow keys to move the entire ensemble of gradients as a whole.</p>
			<p>
				What's more, any number of end stop handles (but not middle stops) can be<em>merged</em>. Just move one handle close enough to another, and it will snap to it and
merge. (The status bar will report the merged status of such a handle—for example,<span class="ui">Gradient point shared by 2 gradients</span>.)
When you drag such a merged handle, that affects all the gradients to which it belongs.
To separate a merged handle, drag away from it with Shift.</p>
			<p>
				For example, you can merge the centers of two objects' elliptic gradients, merge an
elliptic handle with another object's linear handle, merge all three elliptic handles of
multiple objects, or merge the gradients on fill and stroke of the same object, as shown in <a href="#fig10-8">Figure 10-8</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig10-8"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="11/gradient-merge.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 10-8: Merging gradient handles</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>When you drag to create a new gradient with several objects selected, you get
what looks and acts like a single gradient applied to multiple objects—but it's actually
many gradients with their handles merged together.</p>
			<p>
				If two handles have different colors or opacities, they will remain different
after you merge them. However, if you assign some color or opacity to a merged handle, it
will apply to all the stops merged at this handle, equalizing their styles. If
you want to change the style of one of the merged handles without unmerging it, this is
possible if the merged handles belong to different objects: simply <a id="184"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_184" title="184"/>deselect everything
(both handles and objects) and select only the object whose handle you want to repaint.</p>
			<p>
				When dragged, any handle of an object's gradient <em>snaps</em> obeying
the snap bar toggles (<a href="c07.xhtml#section7.3">7.3</a>). In particular, the gradient handles
as a snappable are controlled by the master toggle of the second family
(<span class="ui">Snap nodes, paths, and handles</span>). The snap targets for gradient handles are controlled
by the individual toggles in the first and second families; you can snap to edges, corners,
centers, or midpoints of the bounding boxes, to paths and path intersections, and to
cusp or smooth nodes on paths. Of course, you can also snap to grid or guides when
they are present and enabled.</p>
			<p>
				Also, when dragging a handle or when creating a gradient, holding

			<h2>10.5 Multistage Gradients</h2>
			<p>
				A gradient that has at least one middle stop between the end stops is called<em>multistage</em> because it contains more than one color transition. In such a
gradient, each middle stop has its own color and transparency, but its position is
limited to somewhere in between the end stops. In Inkscape, a middle stop is
represented by a diamond-shaped handle, as shown in <a id="figref7"/><a href="c15b.xhtml#ill-fig7">Figure 7 in the color insert</a>.</p>
			<a id="section10.5.1"/><h3>10.5.1 Creating Middle Stops</h3>
			<p>To add a middle stop in a gradient, double-click or
Ctrl-Alt-click anywhere on the gradient line. The new stop will automatically
get the color and transparency of the clicked point, so the appearance of the gradient does not change.</p>
			<p>
				You can <em>drag and drop</em> a color from the palette onto the gradient
line. Dropping a color on an existing handle changes the color of that stop; dropping it
anywhere else on the gradient line <em>creates</em> a new stop with that color.</p>
			<p>
				When two or more adjacent handles are selected, pressing Insert adds new stops in the
middles of all selected stop intervals (much the same as it does for nodes in the Node tool,<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.5.3">12.5.3</a>). The "plus" button on the Gradient tool's controls bar has the same effect.
New handles added in this way are included in the <a id="185"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_185" title="185"/>handle selection, so
pressing Insert repeatedly adds more and more handles; if you start with two handles
selected and press Insert <em>n</em> times, you will end up with 2<sup><em>n</em></sup> handles.</p>
			<p>To delete all selected stops, simply press Delete. You can also delete individual stops (selected
or not) by Ctrl-Alt-clicking them. Or select a stop and click the "minus" button on the controls bar.</p>
			<p>Deleting is not limited to middle stops; you can delete an end stop as
well, so that the nearest intermediate stop becomes the new end stop of the gradient. When
you delete an end handle of a linear gradient or a radii handle of an elliptic gradient,
the behavior depends on how you did it; if you Ctrl-Alt-clicked the end node,
the closest remaining handle moves up to its place so the gradient span stays the same,
but if you selected the node and pressed Delete, the gradient shortens. If
you delete the central handle of an elliptic, its nearest handle always moves in to
become the new center. Finally, if you delete an end handle of a two-stop gradient, the
gradient disappears and the object becomes painted with the flat color and opacity of the last
remaining stop.</p>
			<p>
				Pressing Ctrl-L with some intermediate stops selected <em>simplifies</em>
the selected portion of the gradient, removing those stops that can be removed without
too much change in the look of the gradient (compare <a href="c12.xhtml#section12.3">12.3</a>). In particular, new stops created by
double-clicking or pressing Insert initially do not change the appearance of the
gradient, and simplifying will delete all redundant stops that weren't moved or repainted
since creation. You may need to press Ctrl-L repeatedly to delete all
unneeded stops.</p>
			<a id="section10.5.2"/><h3>10.5.2 Moving Middle Stops</h3>
			<p>
				Naturally,
you can move a middle stop's handle along the gradient line (either by dragging or with arrow keys)
no further than its neighboring handles.
Dragging a middle
handle with Ctrl snaps it to 1/10 fractions of the available range—that is,
it will snap to 1/10, 2/10, 3/10, and so on of the span between its neighbors. The <span class="ui">Offset</span>
field on the controls bar displays and lets you edit the position of the selected stop
within the gradient (between 0 and 1).</p>
			<p>
				Two or more middle stops may <em>coincide</em>. If they have different colors,
the gradient in that point will have a sharp color boundary. For example, add two
middle stops, paint one green and the other blue, and then drag the green one all the way
to the blue one to create a sharp green-blue boundary in the gradient.</p>
			<p>
				Dragging multiple selected handles with Alt moves them in a soft
"rubbery" manner. The handle that you grab and drag moves all the way, but all other selected handles lag
behind, the more so the farther they are from the handle you drag. The selected part
of the gradient, instead of moving rigidly as a whole, smoothly reshapes as you drag
(compare the node sculpting feature in the Node tool, <a href="c12.xhtml#section12.5.7.2">12.5.7.2</a>).</p>
			<p>
				Why is this useful? One gradient feature Inkscape (and SVG in general) lacks is<em>profiles</em>, which means any transition between two colors is always linear and cannot
accelerate or decelerate (that is, it cannot shift more toward one of its end stops).
However, Alt-dragging of middle stops makes it easy to <em>approximate</em><a id="186"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_186" title="186"/>such nonlinear profiles. If you have a two-stop gradient that you want to
shape according to a curved profile, select both ends of the gradient, press
Insert several times to add a number of intermediate handles, then
Alt-drag a handle in the middle to smoothly reshape the gradient, as shown in <a href="#fig10-10">Figure 10-10</a>.</p>

			<h2>10.6 Gradient Tips and Examples</h2>
			<p>
				If you want to "fade out" or "feather" the edge of an object, you don't have to
apply a color-to-transparent gradient to it (indeed, often you <em>can't</em>, for example, if it's a bitmap that can have no fill).
You could use a mask (<a href="c18.xhtml#section18.3">18.3</a>); however, if the
background under the object is a solid color, a collection of overlay
objects (<em>shaders</em>) of the same color as the background with an opaque-to-transparent
gradient may often be easier to create and maintain. This method works equally well for multiple objects that need to be
feathered as a group, for different feathering on different sides, for objects that already have
different gradient fills, or for bitmaps or pattern-filled objects.</p>
			<p>
				In <a href="#fig10-11">Figure 10-11</a>, four gradient shaders are put over the edges of a bitmap to feather it
out on a white background.</p>
			<a id="fig10-11"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="11/gradient-feathering.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 10-11: Feathering the edge of a rectangular object with
linear gradient shaders</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				When using shaders, you don't need to move the gradient handles to put the
gradient where you need it. Instead, just transform the entire shader object
with that gradient. In <a href="#fig10-12">Figure 10-12</a>, the Gradient tool was used only twice: to
create opaque-to-transparent elliptic gradients on two ellipses, one white and one
black. Then, a total of 29 clones (linked copies) of these shader ellipses, variously
scaled and rotated, all with various reduced master opacity levels, were used to add
depth to the cartoon face.</p>
			<a id="fig10-12"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="11/gradient-cartoon.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 10-12: Adding depth to a cartoon with elliptic gradient
shaders</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="187"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_187" title="187"/>One problem with black (or any other dark-colored) shaders is that they may not look
soft enough—too blunt at the edges, especially when fully opaque. This is
the result of the default gradient profile being linear. You can try to fix the problem by
adding mid stops and "profiling" them by Alt-dragging (<a href="#section10.5.2">10.5.2</a>). 
Another trick is to blur the shader a bit (<a href="c17.xhtml#section17.1">17.1</a>) so that its edges become less pronounced.</p>
			<p>
				However, perhaps the simplest workaround for this problem is drawing a gradient not from
opaque black to transparent black (which is the default), but from opaque black to
transparent <em>white</em> (or, if you will be using the shader on some other light color,
to the transparent version of that light color), as shown in <a href="#fig10-13">Figure 10-13</a>. This changes the perceived gradient
profile drastically, making its edges a lot smoother and more natural. On the downside,
this may make the center of the elliptic gradient a little too sharp, which you can often 
fix simply by scaling the shader object up somewhat.</p>
			<a id="fig10-13"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="11/gradient-pseudoprofile.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 10-13: A better gradient profile for a dark shader by
using a fully transparent light color at the edge</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Using gradients in design often involves <em>overlaying</em> several objects with
semitransparent gradients. <a id="figref8"/><a href="c15b.xhtml#ill-fig8">Figure 8 in the color insert</a> demonstrates a colored water drop (or a glass
button), which is in fact a group of six objects with various elliptic gradients.</p>
			<p>
				The Tweak tool's color modes (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.9">8.9</a>) can paint or randomize colors not only in flat-color fills or
strokes but in gradients, too. For gradients, the tool takes into account not only the
position of the object with the gradient, but also the position of each gradient
stop relative to the tool's brush.</p>
			<p>
				For example, you can re-color only the blue end of an object with a blue-red
gradient simply by painting over that blue end with a brush small enough not to touch
the red. Color tweaking does not <em>create</em> gradients on objects that used <a id="188"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_188" title="188"/>flat color
before, nor does it add stops, but it paints the stops of the existing gradients in the drawing.</p>
			<p>
				Let's give it a try. Take a simple opaque-black to transparent-black gradient,
add a lot of middle stops by repeatedly pressing Insert, then randomize the lightness of the
stops by stroking over the object with a Tweak brush in Jitter Colors mode, with only the L
channel enabled. Then, repeat the same for two more copies of the smooth original
gradient, and overlay them all on top of each other with a little rotation. The
resulting texture is a quite believable misty seascape, as shown in <a href="#fig10-14">Figure 10-14</a>.</p>

			<h2>
				10.7 Mesh Gradients <span class="NoteHead">[1.1]</span></h2>
			<p>
				Similar to plain old-style gradients, <em>mesh gradients</em>, or simply <em>meshes</em>, also create smooth transitions between two or more colors.
However, in a mesh, the points that carry these colors—analogous to gradient stops of a linear or elliptic gradient—are not
positioned on the same straight line. Instead, the color <em>nodes</em> can be placed anywhere inside or outside the object.
Also, the nodes are connected into a grid-like or conical <em>mesh</em>, whose segments are Bézier curves, similar to those used in paths (<a href="c12.xhtml#ch12">Chapter 12</a>).
The areas delineated by segments are called <em>mesh patches</em>.</p>
			<p>
				Each mesh node has a color/opacity of its own; moving the nodes around, adding new nodes (and therefore multiplying segments and patches),
as well as reshaping the connecting segments, affects how the color transitions between them stretch and bend. All this machinery allows
you, with some skill, to create realistic approximations of various objects and effects quickly and efficiently. When tracing photos, you will
even be able to do this, to an extent, automatically by picking the colors from under the meshed object (<a href="#section10.7.5">10.7.5</a>).</p>

					<h2>Meshes in Adobe Illustrator</h2>

						Inkscape's Mesh Gradient tool works much like the Mesh tool in Adobe Illustrator. However, neither of the two applications can yet natively import each other's meshes. Inkscape imports meshes in AI and PDF files by approximating them with flat-color tiles with adjustable precision (<a href="b02.xhtml#sectionB.5">B.5</a>).</p>

			<p><a id="189"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_189" title="189"/>Mesh gradients are a relatively recent addition to Inkscape. I would be happy to say they are an addition to the SVG standard as well, but alas,
this is not quite the case yet. Mesh gradients were in a draft of SVG 2.0 and extensively developed by the working group of the
standard. Inkscape provided the first and by far the most advanced implementation of this new feature. However, browser vendors were
reluctant to support it at all.</p>
			<p>Understandably, Chrome or Firefox have rather more clout in the tech world than Inkscape; for SVG in particular, browser support is
critical for survival. As a result, in order to speed up its adoption, the SVG working group decided to drop this feature from the upcoming
SVG 2.0 standard. Meshes may be reinstated in a future version of SVG; meanwhile, Inkscape has no plans of discontinuing its support of mesh
gradients even though this feature is currently not standard SVG.</p>
			<a id="section10.7.1"/><h3>10.7.1 When to Use Mesh Gradients?</h3>
			<p>A mesh gradient is a curious hybrid of bitmap and vector graphics. Like a bitmap, it is a grid of colored points—sometimes lots of them.
Like a vector gradient, it allows you significant freedom in placing these points and smoothly interpolates colors between them. A perfect
use case for mesh gradients is therefore something that is too organic, amorphous, or freeform for plain geometric gradients—but
still smooth, without too much texture or fine details.</p>
			<p>This class of mesh-friendly imagery includes all kinds of (mostly) smooth objects with soft, subtle color changes, curvilinear
shades and highlights: clothes and drapery, faces and bodies, fruits and flowers, tree trunks and tree leaves, tableware, cars, ships, and sails.
Also, as you'll see below, meshes are handy when you include a bitmap image in your drawing and need to retouch it to mask out some details.</p>
			<p>While definitely more powerful than plain gradients, meshes in Inkscape are also much more complex and, as of yet, not as convenient to use.
Many of the things that make working with regular gradients much easier (such as coloring with the Tweak tool or Alt-dragging multiple nodes) don't yet work
in the Mesh Gradient tool. Hopefully the UI will keep improving in future versions.</p>
			<p>
				Another thing to keep in mind is that mesh gradients, as of now, are an Inkscape-only feature not supported by other SVG software. If you plan
to export your final artwork as bitmap or PDF, this shouldn't bother you much. If you plan to share your work in SVG format, your best bet is
to convert the mesh to bitmap (<a href="c18.xhtml#section18.6.4">18.6.4</a>) inside the SVG document.</p>

				10.7.2 <a id="190"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_190" title="190"/>Creating a Mesh</h3>
			<p>
				To create a mesh on a path (<a href="c12.xhtml#ch12">Chapter 12</a>), a shape (<a href="c11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11</a>), or even a text object (<a href="c15.xhtml#ch15">Chapter 15</a>), switch to the Mesh Gradient
tool via the toolbar button and double-click the object (<a href="#fig10-15">Figure 10-15</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig10-15"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="11/mesh-create.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 10-15: Creating a mesh gradient on a pear-shaped path</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				By default, the tool creates the simplest possible rectangular mesh with one patch and four nodes in the corners of the object's bounding box.
You can change the initial number of patches using the <span class="ui">Rows</span> and <span class="ui">Columns</span> values on the controls bar (they 
affect only newly created meshes but not those that already exist). The nodes are initially colored, in checkerboard order, with the object's original color
(for example, yellow) and opaque white.</p>
			<p>Just as with linear or elliptic gradients, you can create a mesh gradient on an object's fill or stroke. This is controlled by a switch on the controls bar.</p>
			<a id="section10.7.2.1"/>
			<h4>10.7.2.1 Rectangular or Conical?</h4>
			<p>
				Another switch on the controls bar offers a choice of a <em>rectangular</em> or <em>conical</em> mesh. A conical mesh, with a central point and radial segments, sounds
like a great idea for (roughly) circular or otherwise centrally symmetric objects. In fact, when you create a mesh on a polygon or star (<a href="c11.xhtml#section11.5">11.5</a>),
Inkscape will create a conical mesh, with the corresponding number of radii, regardless of the rectangular/conical switch on the controls bar.</p>
			<p>
				However, a conical mesh is not a different mesh type; under the hood, it is still a rectangular mesh, only bent into a circle,
with all nodes on one of the sides gathered into the same central point. One of the radii of a conical mesh is therefore a seam that can be opened up, as shown in <a href="#fig10-16">Figure 10-16</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig10-16"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="11/mesh-conical.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 10-16: The anatomy of a conical mesh gradient</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				When editing a conical mesh, you will want to avoid disheveling the seam or the central point. That's not hard to do; just remember
to select the nodes on the seam and the central node by dragging around them, not by clicking—so that you select <em>all</em> the overlapped nodes in that location
(a simple click selects only one of the coinciding nodes).</p>
			<p><a id="191"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_191" title="191"/>Note that in the initial conical mesh created by Inkscape, different nodes in the center have different (alternating) colors, which gives this area its
characteristic conical appearance. If you want to edit the colors while keeping them different, you will have to move them apart, apply the colors, and
then merge the nodes back. Otherwise, if you select all the central nodes by dragging around them and apply the color, you will get a plain symmetric
color peak (similar to an elliptic gradient) instead of a cone (<a href="#fig10-17">Figure 10-17</a>).</p>

			<h3>10.7.3 Shaping a Mesh</h3>
			<p>
				Mesh nodes are, in many ways, similar to path nodes (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.1">12.1</a>). The biggest difference is that only the corner nodes of a mesh have two handles
and two segments attached to them (like non-end nodes on a path); the edge nodes of a mesh have three handles/segments, and the inner
nodes have four. This proliferation of controls makes editing complex meshes difficult. You can select and move multiple nodes, but you cannot
elastically Alt-drag them (compare <a href="c12.xhtml#section12.5.7.2">12.5.7.2</a>), which would be the most appropriate for the "mesh cloth," nor does the
Tweak tool (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.6">12.6</a>) work on mesh nodes.</p>
			<p>
				In a mesh, you want the nodes—the carriers of the colors—to be positioned where you have your tinted spots, the peak highlights
and shadows on your object. However, the shape of the segments connecting the nodes is no less important than the position of the nodes, because
the segments form the "force field" that bends and stretches the tints. It is best to minimize mesh node editing by making sure that the new
nodes are <em>created</em> more or less where you will need them and that the newly added segments <em>already</em> stick to the shape of the
object you're modeling with your mesh.</p>
			<p>
				When you are subdividing a mesh, new segments are created by <em>interpolating</em> between the adjacent existing segments.
This gives us an optimal strategy: start <a id="192"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_192" title="192"/>with a minimal four-node single-patch mesh (<a href="#fig10-15">Figure 10-15</a>, left), but
before adding any more nodes, shape this outer frame to match the overall shape of the modeled object (in my case, a pear). Since
the outside of a mesh is always fully transparent (see <a href="#fig10-16">Figure 10-16</a>, left),
you need to place the outer nodes close enough to the object's path but on the outside, as shown in <a href="#fig10-18">Figure 10-18</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig10-18"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="11/mesh-shape.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 10-18: Shaping the outer edge of the mesh before adding any more nodes</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Unlike paths (compare <a href="c12.xhtml#section12.5.5">12.5.5</a>), there is no smooth node type for meshes, so you will need to drag the nodes
and their handles manually to make them smooth and shape the segments. You can select multiple nodes and drag them at once;
note that the handles of a selected node become oriented triangles pointing to their mother node (this makes disentangling a complex
mesh a little easier, since there are no lines connecting a node and its handles). You can also switch a segment (after you select
its end nodes) to a straight line and back to a curve using the two buttons on the controls bar.</p>
			<p>
				Since reshaping even a simple mesh is such a hassle, you may be glad to learn than when you create a mesh on an ellipse
(<a href="c11.xhtml#section11.4">11.4</a>), Inkscape automatically shapes it to match the elliptic shape (<a href="#fig10-19">Figure 10-19</a>, left; 
note that this is a rounded rectangular mesh, not a conical mesh). Thus, if your object is roughly circular or elliptic
(such as a plate or a drop of liquid), it may make sense to create it
as an ellipse first, make a mesh on it, and then, if necessary, convert it to a path and reshape it within its elliptical
mesh. One problem with this approach is that the Node tool shows both path nodes and mesh nodes (that look quite similar) at the same
time; to hide the mesh nodes, uncheck <span class="ui"><strong>Enable gradient editing</strong></span> on the <span class="ui"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> page for the Node tool (this affects
both gradient and mesh nodes).</p>
			<a id="section10.7.4"/><h3>10.7.4 Subdividing a Mesh</h3>
			<p>
				Once you have shaped your object more or less as you want it to be <em>and</em> shaped the default single-patch mesh to cling
to the object (<a href="#fig10-18">Figure 10-18</a>), you may start subdividing the mesh to add more points and patches. Now, the interpolated<a id="193"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_193" title="193"/>segments and points
will follow the mesh's outer shape—like meridians and parallels on a globe—so, in most cases, they will require only minimal
editing. All that remains to do is assign colors to the mesh nodes to create the shading and tints you envision.</p>
			<p>
				Subdividing the mesh is pretty easy. You can do it semi-automatically by selecting two or more nodes and pressing Insert or Shift-I:
this adds a node (and corresponding segments) halfway between (each pair of) selected nodes. For example, if you select all four nodes
(Ctrl-A) of a single-patch mesh and press Insert, you end up with a 2×2 patch mesh with nine nodes in total. Now, if you 
press Ctrl-A again (to add the newly created nodes to selection) and then Insert again, 
each segment will be bisected once more, producing 4×4 patches and 25 nodes (<a href="#fig10-19">Figure 10-19</a>).</p>
			<a id="fig10-19"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="11/mesh-subdivide-ins.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 10-19: Subdividing a shaped mesh using the Insert key</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Such indiscriminate doubling up of the mesh is a decent strategy if you don't have a good idea of the best locations for the nodes
(for example, when creating a bitmap retouching patch, <a href="#section10.7.5.1">10.7.5.1</a>). If you do know where the peak highlights, shadows, and tinted 
spots are going to be, aim for them using manual subdivision. Double-clicking a segment in any point adds a node in that
point and runs a new chain of segments through that point. For example, if you want a highlight in point A, first double-click the
top segment in point B so you have a segment running through A, then double-click in A to create an intersection, as shown in <a href="#fig10-20">Figure 10-20</a>.</p>

				<figcaption>
					<p>Figure 10-20: Subdividing a shaped mesh by manual creation of nodes</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Note that adding nodes (with either method) does not change how the mesh looks: Inkscape interpolates not only positions and segment
shapes but also colors—so that new nodes get exactly the color that the mesh had in this point anyway. It's now up to you to sculpt
the color transitions by applying color to the new nodes.</p>

				10.7.5 <a id="194"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_194" title="194"/>Coloring Mesh Nodes</h3>
			<p>Don't get overexcited with subdividing your mesh before you start actually coloring it; it is better to start minimally and add new
nodes only when you see that you can't get the coloring right without it. Nothing beats seeing how a pretty minimal mesh can
produce an amazingly lifelike interplay of colors and shades.</p>
			<p>
				Before you get to coloring, however, I recommend that you switch the mesh for the default <span class="ui">Coons</span> interpolation to <span class="ui">Bicubic</span> on the controls
bar. The <span class="ui">Coons</span> interpolation is linear, which makes the mesh look unnaturally angular; the <span class="ui">Bicubic</span> interpolation is much smoother.</p>
			<p>
				Actual painting of the mesh nodes works the same as with gradient stops (<a href="#section10.4.2">10.4.2</a>). Select one or mode nodes (click, Shift-click,
rubberband drag) and assign a color from a palette, or adjust the existing color via the <span class="ui">Fill and Stroke</span> dialog (again, I recommend the <span class="ui">Wheel</span> tab
as the most natural). You can also drag-and-drop color from the palette onto a node (selected or not).</p>

						If you select several nodes, all you can do is assign the same color to all of them. There's currently no way to adjust them, for example, by making all selected nodes
darker while keeping them different. The Tweak tool's coloring modes (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.9">8.9</a>) do not yet work on mesh gradient nodes.</p>

			<p>
				From here on, working with a mesh is basically a repeated cycle of:
select a node; adjust its color; deselect the node and the object (to hide the mesh, as it's hard to see how your colors look with the mesh sitting on top);
select the object again; and repeat. Infrequently, you may also
need to add a node by subdividing or move nodes by a little bit. Just invest enough time into this and you will be amazed by how lifelike your object emerges (<a id="figref9"/><a href="c15b.xhtml#ill-fig9">Figure 9 in the color insert</a>).</p>
			<p>
				Several points are worth noting in <a href="#fig10-20">Figure 10-20</a>. Point A retains the original yellow color I assigned to all nodes at first; it is much easier
to start with such an average color and then create slight deviations from it. Points B and C are the two main highlights; they are painted a very light (almost
white) shade of the pear's yellow. Point D adds a green accent, and points E, F, and G contribute some redness. Naturally, the points on the right and bottom of the pear
are painted darker to create the overall shading, but there are local exceptions to this; in particular, the edge nodes from E1 to E2 and from E3 to E4 (note that they
lie outside the actual shape) are made pure white to create the "dissolving edge" effect as when the object is in front of a brightly lit background (such as a window).</p>
			<a id="section10.7.5.1"/><h4>10.7.5.1 Patching a Bitmap with a Mesh</h4>
			<p>
				Meshes are an easy way to create a photo retouching patch—an object that perfectly blends in with a bitmap but covers something on the
bitmap image that you don't need. Let's suppose you want to mask out the craquelure on one of Mona Lisa's cheeks. Start by drawing a rounded object over an area.
Create a rectangular mesh on it and subdivide it a few times with Insert (<a href="#section10.7.4">10.7.4</a>). For best results, the mesh's outer nodes should
be outside the object's area; for this, just select all the nodes of the path (not the mesh) in the Node tool and scale the path down by pressing &lt; a few
times (<a href="c12.xhtml#section12.5.7.3">12.5.7.3</a>), as shown in <a id="figref10"/><a href="c15b.xhtml#ill-fig10">Figure 10 in the color insert</a>.</p>
			<p><a id="195"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_195" title="195"/>Now, all you need to do is select all mesh nodes in the Mesh Gradient tool and click the <span class="ui">Pick colors</span> button on the controls bar. For each selected
node, Inkscape looks up the background (that is, bitmap) color at this point and assigns that color to the node. The patch is still visible in close-up
because its smoothness contrasts with the craquelure texture of the rest of the face—but if you zoom out a little, it blends in perfectly! While it may be
possible to achieve a similar effect with other tools (plain gradients, Dropper tool, blur), only mesh gradients make retouching so delightfully easy.</p>
			<a id="section10.8"/><h2>10.8 Patterns</h2>
			<p>
				A <em>pattern</em> is a paint type (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.2">8.2</a>) where an object's fill or stroke consists of
repeated copies of a <em>tile</em>. The tile can be anything: a single object or a group of objects, using
any style properties or Inkscape techniques (for example, a tile may itself be recursively painted
with a pattern). This universality makes patterns a very rich and flexible feature. In another respect, however,
patterns in SVG are limited: they can tile only in a simple rectangular grid with no rotations or
reflections (compare the clone tiler, <a href="c16.xhtml#section16.6">16.6</a>, which can arrange clones using 17 different planar
symmetry types).</p>
			<p>
				You cannot have both a gradient and a pattern on an object; they are two
alternative paint types. If you want a transparency gradient on an object with a pattern,
read <a href="#section10.6">10.6</a> on shaders or <a href="c18.xhtml#section18.3">18.3</a> on masks.</p>
			<a id="section10.8.1"/><h3>10.8.1 Creating Patterns</h3>
			<p>
				Unlike gradients or meshes, patterns don't have a dedicated creation tool in Inkscape. Instead,
just select the object or objects that you want to turn into a tile and choose <span class="ui"><strong>Object<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Pattern<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Objects 
to Pattern</strong></span> from the menu, or press Alt-I.</p>
			<p>
				The selected objects do not disappear and don't visibly change; however, you'll
notice that instead of the original object(s), you now have a single <em>rectangle</em>
selected.  This rectangle is filled with the pattern made out of your object(s), and it
has exactly the size and position of their bounding box, which means that exactly one
copy of the pattern fits into the rectangle. If you now drag the rectangle sizing handle
(using the Rectangle or Node tool), you will see the other tiles as well, as <a href="#fig10-21">Figure 10-21</a> demonstrates.</p>
			<a id="fig10-21"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="11/gradient-pattern.svg.png"/>

					<p>Figure 10-21: Creating a pattern from objects</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><a id="196"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_196" title="196"/>Now you can easily assign the new pattern to any object by choosing <span class="ui">Copy</span> and <span class="ui">Paste
Style</span> from this rectangle (which you can then delete if no longer needed), or by
choosing it from the pattern list in the <span class="ui">Fill and Stroke</span> dialog, as shown in <a href="#fig10-22">Figure 10-22</a>.</p>
			<a id="fig10-22"/><figure>
				<img alt="" src="11/gradient-pattern-fillstroke.svg.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p>
						Figure 10-22: The pattern paint in the <span class="ui">Fill and Stroke</span>
dialog</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>SVG allows you to set margins around tiles in a pattern to space them
apart. Inkscape does not yet support doing this via the UI, but a simpler approach
is to add to the original objects, before you turn them into a pattern, a transparent rectangle extending beyond the
edges of the other objects and thus adding separation between the pattern's tiles. It is not
possible to make pattern tiles overlap.</p>
			<p>
				If you want to extract the tile objects back from a pattern in order to edit them,
select an object with that pattern and use the <span class="ui"><strong>Object<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Pattern<span class="MenuArrow"> ▶ </span>Pattern to Objects</strong></span> command
(but make a copy of the patterned object first if you don't want to lose it).</p>
			<a id="section10.8.2"/><h3>10.8.2 Editing Patterns</h3>
			<p>
				When you are in the Node tool or a shape tool, each object with a pattern fill displays three editing handles that allow you to move,
scale, and rotate the pattern within the object (<a href="#fig10-21">Figure 10-21</a>). As with gradients, these handles can be
anywhere on the canvas, not necessarily on the object itself. Clicking a scale or rotate handle (but, for some reason, not the move
handle) selects it, and you can then move it with the arrow keys.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>X-shaped handle</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Positioned in the top-left corner of one of the
tiles (the "origin" tile). Dragging this handle <em>moves</em> the pattern in any
direction.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt>Square handle</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Positioned in the bottom-right corner of the origin tile. Dragging
this handle <em>scales</em> the pattern. To make the scaling uniform
(that is, to preserve the width/height ratio
of the tiles), drag with Ctrl.</p>
				</dd>
				<dt><a id="197"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_197" title="197"/>Round handle
				</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Positioned in the top-right corner of the origin
tile. Dragging this handle <em>rotates</em> the pattern around the X-shaped handle as an
axis. Drag with Ctrl to snap the rotation angle to 15-degree steps.</p>
				</dd>
			</dl><a id="section10.8.3"/>
			<h3>10.8.3 Patterns in Art</h3>
			<p>
				Aesthetically, the problem with patterns is the same as their main advantage:<em>repetitiveness</em>. Patterns may be necessary or at least acceptable in technical
illustrations, but artistic drawings are rarely improved by an annoyingly repetitive rectangular
pattern.</p>
			<p>
				If you use a pattern in your artwork but don't want it to look too oppressively regular, you may want to scale the pattern up (so that fewer copies of it fit into the patterned object) and/or rotate it away from horizontal/vertical. A more radical approach is to tile not a single object but a random scattering of several copies (or clones) of it; this way, it may take the viewer some effort to notice any regularity at all (that's how the stock polka dot patterns were made, <a href="#section10.8.4">10.8.4</a>).</p>
				<a id="section10.8.4"/>
				<h3>10.8.4 Stock Patterns</h3>
			<p>
				The <span class="ui">Objects to Pattern</span> command is not the only way to add patterns to your
document. Inkscape comes with a selection of simple <em>stock patterns</em> that you can
reuse in your documents.</p>
			<p>
				Select an object and switch it to pattern paint by clicking the <span class="ui"><strong>Pattern</strong></span> button
on the corresponding tab of the <span class="ui"><strong>Fill and Stroke</strong></span> dialog. You will see a
drop-down list (<a href="#fig10-22">Figure 10-22</a>) that contains your document's custom patterns, if any, at the top,
and then a set of stock Inkscape patterns after a separator. To use any of the patterns,
simply select it from the list.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					There is a selection of plain <span class="ui">Stripes</span> with different ratios of stripe width to gap
width, in the range from 4:1 to 1:64. For example, the <span class="ui">Stripes 1:2</span> pattern has
gaps twice as wide as the stripes. All stripes patterns exist in two versions: with black
stripes and with white stripes (gaps are always transparent).</li>
				<li>
					There are two <span class="ui">Checkerboard</span> patterns with black and white odd squares (even squares
are transparent).</li>
				<li>
					The <span class="ui">Packed Circles</span> option is a dense
hexagonal pattern of black circles with transparent gaps.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Polka Dots</span> is a scattering of dots
randomly but evenly distributed to mask the regularity of the
repeating pattern. This pattern has three size variants
(small, medium, and large dots) and two color variants (black and white
dots).</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Wavy</span> is a pattern of wavy lines with transparent gaps between them.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Camouflage</span> is a green-toned protective pattern such as that used by the
military.</li>
				<li><span class="ui">Ermine</span> is the traditional heraldic pattern, originating from
a stylized representation of stoat furs with black tails.</li>
				<li><a id="198"/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_198" title="198"/>The three bitmap patterns, <span class="ui">Sand</span>, <span class="ui">Cloth</span>, and<span class="ui">Old Paint</span>, are based on seamless photographic tiles and allow you to add
some natural texture to your drawing. All of them are grayscale, so you can make objects
with these textures semitransparent and overlay them on other colored objects to
texturize them.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Stock patterns are stored in the file inkscape/paint/patterns.svg in
Inkscape's data folder that you can look up in <span class="ui">Preferences</span>, <span class="ui">System</span> page. You can add your own patterns
to this file or replace it with any other SVG file containing the stock patterns you need.</p>
			<a id="section10.8.5"/><h3>
				10.8.5 Hatches <span class="NoteHead">[1.1]</span></h3>
			<p>
				Hatches are an alternative mechanism that SVG offers for painting an object with repeated copies of something. Hatches are more limited
than patterns in that they can't use <em>any</em> object as a tile but only a path fragment—which is used to, well, hatch the
object that refers to this hatch as fill or stroke paint.</p>
			<p>
				Hatches are a new feature in SVG 2.0 (still not finalized, as of this writing) and are not universally supported in browsers. Inkscape can
render SVG hatches, but it doesn't offer on-canvas handles and other conveniences for editing them. It's not a feature I would
recommend anyone use; I am mentioning hatches only because Inkscape comes with a number of stock hatches you can browse and
apply from the <span class="ui">Paint Servers</span> dialog (<a href="#section10.9">10.9</a>).</p>
			<a id="section10.9"/><h2>
				10.9 The Paint Servers Dialog <span class="NoteHead">[1.1]</span></h2>
			<p>
				Remember that paint (<a href="c08.xhtml#section8.2">8.2</a>) is anything that is used to draw an object's fill or stroke. Of all the paint types, some
are simple (such as no paint or flat color paint) and some are complex (such as a gradient or pattern). In SVG, complex paints are defined
not in the objects that use them but separately—which is why you can, for example, share gradient definitions between objects (<a href="#section10.2">10.2</a>).
Such complex paints are called <em>paint servers</em> because they provide their paint to any number of users (that is, objects).</p>
			<p>
				Inkscape has a <span class="ui">Paint Servers</span> dialog (from the <span class="ui">Object</span> menu) that lets you review the paint servers and apply them to a selected
object's fill or stroke. It's not something you couldn't do with other tools and dialogs; the primary value of this dialog is that it shows each paint as
a thumbnail, making comparisons easier. You can view the paint servers (gradients, mesh gradients, patterns, and hatches) defined in the<span class="ui">Current document</span>, or you can review the stock <span class="ui">Patterns</span> and <span class="ui">Hatches</span> supplied with the program.</p>

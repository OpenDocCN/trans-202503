    book’s three projects, and you’re wondering what to do now. The good news (or
    the bad news, depending on your outlook) is that the learning never stops. There
    are many different directions in which you can take your programming career. Here
    are some suggestions about possible next steps and tools and resources to explore.

    project at this point, so why not try building something new? One option would
    be to make your own game, using the techniques you learned in this book. Some
    relatively simple arcade games in a similar vein to *Pong* include *Snake*, *Space
    Invaders*, *Tetris*, and *Breakout*. Or you could try something completely different
    and make a word game, like *Wordle* or *Hangman*.

    by making your own musical creation or data visualization. On the music side,
    you might want to experiment with making a drum machine, or perhaps an endless
    music generator. You could also use your knowledge to add sound effects to one
    of your games. On the data visualization side, there are countless other APIs
    you can try out for fetching data from other services. As discussed in [Chapter
    15](chapter15.xhtml), many APIs require some sort of authentication, which isn’t
    feasible for browser-based applications; with Node.js, however, you can experiment
    with building your own backend applications as well.

    to your code and go back to earlier versions. When I first started programming,
    I would often find myself making changes to my code and breaking something, then
    not understanding how I had broken it and not being able to get back to the previous
    state. To avoid that, I started making backups of my code so I could go back to
    an earlier version. Git is a much better way to achieve the same goal. With Git,
    you make *commits* that store the state of your code at a particular point in
    time. Each commit builds on previous ones, while keeping track of what’s changed.

    tests are designed to run against your code regularly, to confirm it does what
    you expect it to do. A common problem when writing code is adding a new feature
    without realizing that the change breaks some other aspect of your program. By
    writing good tests and running them regularly, you can identify the moment something
    breaks, and fix it. You can also work on large refactors of your code with confidence,
    knowing that as long as the tests pass, it’s unlikely that you’ve broken anything.

- en: One of the problems that people have with JavaScript is its weak, dynamic typing,
    which allows values to be implicitly coerced to different data types depending
    on the surrounding code. For example, the + operator will convert a number operand
    to a string if the other operand is a string, while the - operator will convert
    a string operand to a number if the other operand is a number.

- en: The TypeScript language is an attempt to add static typing to JavaScript. *Static
    typing* means that a variable of a certain type can only contain values of that
    type, and conversions between types must be explicit. TypeScript is syntactically
    a superset of JavaScript, which means that a valid JavaScript program is also
    a valid TypeScript program. TypeScript code can be converted to JavaScript using
    the TypeScript compiler.
  id: totrans-49

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using static types makes it impossible to write code with certain bugs. For
    example, in JavaScript you might take a value from a text box, assume that it’s
    a number, and add it to another number. Unfortunately, any value from a text box
    is treated as a string, so the other number will be implicitly converted to a
    string as well, and you’ll end up with the two strings concatenated. TypeScript
    doesn’t allow this. It knows that the value from the text box is a string, and
    it forces you to decide whether you want to convert both operands to strings for
    concatenation or convert both operands to numbers for addition.

    The language takes a “batteries included” approach, meaning that its standard
    library comes fully featured with a wide array of functionality (JavaScript’s
    standard library, by comparison, is very limited). Like JavaScript, Python is
    dynamically typed, so the same variable can hold values of different data types.
    But whereas JavaScript is weakly typed, Python is *strongly typed*, meaning that
    there are no implicit coercions. Syntactically, Python looks very different, using
    indentation (which is required, not optional) rather than braces to define nested
    blocks of code.

    is no longer in use—a process that’s error prone and can often lead to bugs. These
    languages are commonly used in performance-critical environments, and they don’t
    use garbage collection because it can reduce the performance of software. Rust
    avoids this problem with a compile-time *borrow checker*, which keeps track of
    which objects are in use at any given time, and by which parts of the program.

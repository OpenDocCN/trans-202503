- en: This is a book about building the network you need. We’ll dip into the topics
    of firewalls and related functions, starting from a little theory. You’ll see
    plenty of examples of filtering and other ways to direct network traffic. I’ll
    assume that you have a basic to intermediate command of TCP/IP networking concepts
    and Unix administration.

    of the manuscript in book form. With all the work that’s gone into making this
    book a useful one over the years, I am fairly confident you will find it useful,
    and I hope you will find it an enjoyable read, too. But please keep in mind that
    this document is not intended as a precooked recipe for cutting and pasting.

    commented-out suggestions for useful configurations, as well as a few examples
    in the documentation directories such as */usr/share/pf/*. These examples are
    useful as a reference, but we won’t use them directly in this book. Instead, you’ll
    learn how to construct a *pf.conf* from scratch, step by step.

    operating systems. Read this chapter first to get a sense of how to work with

    between separate networks. By the end of [Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Into
    the Real World"), you will have built a configuration that is fairly typical for
    a home or small office network, and have some tricks up your sleeve to make network
    management easier. You’ll also get an early taste of how to handle services with
    odd requirements such as FTP, as well as some tips on how to make your network
    troubleshooting-friendly by catering to some of the frequently less understood
    Internet protocols and services.'

    some security challenges, and by the end of this chapter, you may find yourself

    of the information is likely to be useful in wired environments, too.'

    situation where you introduce servers and services that need to be accessible
    from outside your own network. By the end of this chapter, you may have a network
    with one or several separate subnets and DMZs, and you will have tried your hand
    at a couple of different load-balancing schemes via redirections and `relayd`
    in order to improve service quality for your users.'

    password-guessing attempts and other network flooding, as well as the antispam
    tool `spamd`, the OpenBSD spam deferral daemon. This chapter should make your
    network a more pleasant one for legitimate users and less welcoming to those with

    setups to the new system, as well as information on setting up and maintaining
    ALTQ on operating systems where the newer queueing system is not available. This

- en: For a number of reasons, OpenBSD is my favorite operating system. My main environment
    for writing this book is dominated by OpenBSD systems running either recent snapshots,
    the odd -stable system and every now and then a locally built -current. This means
    that the main perspective in the book is the world as seen from the command line
    in OpenBSD 5.6\. However, I keep enough of the other BSDs around that this book
    should be useful even if your choice of platform is FreeBSD, NetBSD or DragonFly
    BSD. There are areas of network configuration and PF setup where those systems
    are noticeably different from the OpenBSD baseline, and in those cases you will
    find notes on the differences as well as platform-specific advice on how to build
    a useful configuration for your environment.

  zh: 由于种种原因，OpenBSD是我最喜欢的操作系统。我写这本书的主要环境是由运行最近快照、偶尔是稳定版系统以及时不时构建的本地-current版本的OpenBSD系统主导的。这意味着本书的主要视角是基于OpenBSD
    5.6的命令行环境。然而，我保留了足够的其他BSD系统，因此即使你的平台选择是FreeBSD、NetBSD或DragonFly BSD，这本书仍然会对你有用。在一些网络配置和PF设置的领域，这些系统与OpenBSD的基础系统有明显的差异，在这些情况下，你会找到关于差异的说明以及如何为你的环境构建有用配置的具体平台建议。

<h2 class="h2s" id="app01"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_233"/><strong>Troubleshooting Tips for Common Errors</strong></h2>&#13;
<p class="intro"><span class="ash">All the sketches for the projects in this book can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nostarch.com/arduinohandbook2/">https://www.nostarch.com/arduinohandbook2/</a> and have been verified to work correctly. However, when you compile a sketch in the Arduino IDE, there are a number of problems that you may encounter.</span></p>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_234"/>This section will go through three of the most common types of errors, explaining why they occur and how to fix them. When an error occurs, the monitor box at the bottom of the IDE will helpfully highlight the line of code that caused the error, as shown in <a href="app01.xhtml#chAfig1">Figure A-1</a>. This information will be invaluable to you in fixing your code.</p>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="chAfig1"/><strong>FIGURE A-1:</strong> The IDE will highlight the line where the error has occurred.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/a-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec125"><span class="ash"><strong>UPLOAD ERROR</strong></span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">When you upload your code, you get a message like the one in <a href="app01.xhtml#chAfig2">Figure A-2</a>, which says:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs1">avrdude: ser_open(): can't open device "COM1": No such file or<br/>directory</p>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="chAfig2"/><strong>FIGURE A-2:</strong> The error message “Problem uploading to board”</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/a-02.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec126"><span class="black"><strong>Solutions</strong></span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This error generally means that the IDE cannot find your Arduino board. Try one of these solutions</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• Check that your USB connection is securely inserted into your PC’s USB port.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_235"/>• In the IDE, open the <strong>Tools</strong> tab and select <strong>Port</strong>. From the drop-down menu, you should see that one of the COM ports is highlighted. If this is not the port your Arduino is connected to, select the correct one.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• If the correct port is already highlighted, verify that the right board type is selected: open the <strong>Tools</strong> tab, select <strong>Board</strong>, and from the drop-down menu make sure the type of Arduino board you have attached is highlighted. This is set to Arduino Uno by default.</p>&#13;
<p class="bull">• You can also check the Arduino documentation for more possible solutions: <em><a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Troubleshooting#upload">http://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Troubleshooting#upload</a></em>.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec127"><span class="ash"><strong>CODE VERIFICATION ERROR #1</strong></span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">When you verify your code, you receive an error like the one in <a href="app01.xhtml#chAfig3">Figure A-3</a>, which says:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs1">expected '}' at end of input</p>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="chAfig3"/><strong>FIGURE A-3:</strong> The error message “expected <span class="literal">'}'</span> at end of input”</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/a-03.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec128"><span class="black"><strong>Solution</strong></span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Check that each opening curly bracket (<span class="literal">{</span>) has a closing curly bracket (<span class="literal">}</span>) and, if not, add the closing bracket. Curly brackets define the start and end of a block of code, and every open bracket needs a closing bracket to complete a function or loop. In this instance, you would add a closed bracket at the end of your code.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec129"><span class="ash"><strong>CODE VERIFICATION ERROR #2</strong></span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">When verifying your code, you receive the error shown in <a href="app01.xhtml#chAfig4">Figure A-4</a>, which says:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs1"> expected ';' before '}' token</p>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_236"/><a id="chAfig4"/><strong>FIGURE A-4:</strong> The error message “expected <span class="literal">';'</span> before <span class="literal">'}'</span> token”</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/a-04.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec130"><span class="black"><strong>Solution</strong></span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This error, one of the most common you’ll encounter, indicates that you missed a semicolon (<span class="literal">;</span>) at the end of a line. Add a semicolon to the line above the one highlighted in the IDE.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec131"><span class="ash"><strong>MISSING LIBRARY ERROR</strong></span></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">When verifying your code, you receive an error like this:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs1">fatal error: #NewPing.h no such file or directory</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The example shown in <a href="app01.xhtml#chAfig5">Figure A-5</a> is from Project 20, which uses the NewPing library.</p>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="chAfig5"/><strong>FIGURE A-5:</strong> The error message “Error compiling for board Arduino/Genuino Uno”</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="Image" src="../images/a-05.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev1sec132"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_237"/><span class="black"><strong>Solution</strong></span></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This error is also quite common and it means the IDE cannot find the expected library in the library folder. Follow the instructions in “<a href="pref02.xhtml#ch00lev1sec118">Installing Libraries</a>” on <a href="pref02.xhtml#page_8">page 8</a> to make sure you’ve installed any libraries required by your code that are not included by default in the IDE. Remember that it is not enough to just download these libraries—you have to install them too.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Each project in this book lists the required libraries at the start of the chapter. You can download those not included in the IDE from <em><a href="https://www.nostarch.com/arduinohandbook2/">https://www.nostarch.com/arduinohandbook2/</a></em>.</p>&#13;

    Well, yes it does, but there is one really big difference. The new window doesn’t
    have a command prompt (`>>>`) at the beginning of each line.

    the program. Even though you write the program in a separate window, IDLE always

- en: Now that you’ve seen the difference between IDLE’s Python shell and IDLE’s text
    editor, you might be wondering when it’s better to use one over the other. As
    a general rule, I use the Python shell when I only want to test a few lines and
    I don’t intend to reuse them. As you follow along with this book, I recommend
    that you run the short examples using the Python shell.

- en: I use the text editor for programs that have quite a few lines of code or that
    I want to reuse. All of the missions in this book use the text editor so you can
    save your progress, but you can always play around in the shell whenever you want
    to try something out quickly.

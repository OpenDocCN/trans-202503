We considered it a shame that most books published about GIMP contained color prints in a middle section only—or no color at all. We are very grateful to both our publishers for having agreed to print in full color, despite the additional costs.</p><p>Our debt to the GIMP developers is immense: The work they did and are still doing is tremendous. Moreover, we had the opportunity to ask them some questions, using the <code class="literal">gimp-user</code> and <code class="literal">gimp-developer</code> mailing lists and the <code class="literal">#gimp</code> IRC channel. They graciously responded to our questions with invaluable first-hand information about difficult aspects of GIMP. We’d especially like to thank Alexia Death, Michael Hammel, Ramón Miranda, Michael Natterer, Sven Neumann, Martin Nordholts, and Alexandre Prokoudine, but many others have also made a vital contribution to the project. Many thanks to everyone involved!</p><p>Several chapters of this book are based on an undergraduate course taught by Olivier from 2002 to 2008. Thus, many examples are inspired by tutorials or other sources dating from that time. We would like to acknowledge our debt to the many people who created these tutorials (especially in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Logos and Textures">Chapter 4</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Animation">Chapter 6</a>) but whose names we no longer remember.</p><p>We would also like to thank the L<span class="smaller">A</span>TEX developers and especially Frank Mittelbach and Michel Goossens, authors of the <span class="emphasis"><em>L</em></span><span class="smaller"><span class="emphasis"><em>A</em></span></span><span class="emphasis"><em>TEX Companion</em></span>, the bible for all L<span class="smaller">A</span>TEX users. Olivier owes a special debt to Frank, who kindly helped him to discover an old bug in the core of L<span class="smaller">A</span>TEX. He would also like to mention Yannis Haralambous, author of the definitive book about fonts and encoding, for his help in getting the proper quote in programming examples.</p><p>We are very grateful to No Starch Press for enthusiastically accepting our book proposal. It is always a pleasure to correspond with Bill Pollock and Tyler Ortman. We are also very, very grateful to Patricia Moncorgé, from Pearson France, who was the first to accept our book project, including simultaneous publication in French and English. Discussions with her have been long, lively, and very fruitful. Without Patricia, this book would probably not exist.</p><p>Thanks to Sondra Silverhawk, the developmental editor, and to Serena Yang, the production editor, at No Starch Press. Also, thank you to LeeAnn Pickrell, the copy editor of the English edition. The editors of the English edition spent innumerable hours correcting errors and language ambiguities in this thick book and improving its style. Special thanks to the two proofreaders, Paula L. Fleming and Riley Hoffman.</p><p>Karine would like to thank her husband Jean, who helped her stay motivated and clearly define her priorities so Olivier would not be kept in the dark, and Olivier for accepting the change of priorities so gracefully.</p><p>Olivier would like to thank his wife Jacqueline, who accepted the fact that for many years she could see her husband only sideways, facing a computer screen. He’d also like to thank his colleagues of the I3S Laboratory, who read drafts of most of the chapters and encouraged him in this long endeavor.</p></div></body></html>

<p class="CO">Virtually every adversary, whether they’re a malicious actor or part of a commercial red team, will sometimes run into defensive products that compromise their operations. Of these defensive products, endpoint detection and response (EDR) presents the largest risk to the post-exploitation phase of an attack. Generally speaking, <i>EDRs</i> are applications installed on a target’s workstations or servers that are designed to collect data about the security of the environment, called <i>telemetry</i>.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">In this chapter, we discuss the components of EDRs, their methods of detecting malicious activity on a system, and their typical designs. We also provide an overview of the difficulties that EDRs can cause attackers.</p>&#13;

<p class="TNI">Later chapters will explore the nuts and bolts of many EDR sensor components, how they work, and how attackers might evade them. First, though, we’ll consider the EDR as a whole and define some terms that you’ll see frequently throughout the book.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H2" id="sec2"><span id="h-6"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">The Agent</samp></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">The EDR <i>agent</i> is an application that controls and consumes data from sensor components, performs some basic analysis to determine whether a given activity or series of events aligns with attacker behavior, and forwards the telemetry to the main server, which further analyzes events from all agents deployed in an environment.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">If the agent deems some activity to be worthy of its attention, it may take any of the following actions: <i>log</i> that malicious activity in the form of an alert sent to a central logging system, such as the EDR’s dashboard or a security incident and event management (SIEM) solution; <i>block</i> the malicious operation’s execution by returning values indicating failure to the program that is performing the action; or <i>deceive</i> the attacker by returning to the caller invalid values, such as incorrect memory addresses or modified access masks, causing the offensive tooling to believe that the operation completed successfully even though subsequent operations will fail.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec3">&#13;
<h3 class="H2" id="sec3"><span id="h-7"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Telemetry</samp></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Every sensor in an EDR serves a common purpose: the collection of telemetry. Roughly defined, <i>telemetry</i> is the raw data generated by a sensor component or the host itself, and defenders can analyze it to determine whether malicious activity has occurred. Every action on the system, from opening a file to creating a new process, generates some form of telemetry. This information becomes a datapoint in the security product’s internal alerting logic.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX"><a href="#fig1-1">Figure 1-1</a> compares telemetry to the data collected by a radar system. Radars use electromagnetic waves to detect the presence, heading, and velocity of objects within some range.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">When a radio wave bounces off an object and returns to the radar system, it creates a datapoint indicating that there is something there. Using these datapoints, the radar system’s processor can determine things such as the object’s speed, location, and altitude and then handle each case differently. For instance, the system might need to respond to an object flying at a slow speed at lower altitudes differently from one flying at a fast speed at higher altitudes.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">This is very similar to how an EDR handles the telemetry collected by its sensors. On its own, information about how a process was created or a file was accessed rarely provides enough context to make an informed decision regarding actions to be taken. They’re just blips on the radar display. Moreover, a process detected by an EDR can terminate at any point in time. <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_3" aria-label=" Page 3. "/>Therefore, it is important for the telemetry feeding into the EDR to be as complete as possible.</p>&#13;

</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">The EDR then passes the data to its detection logic. This detection logic takes all available telemetry and uses some internal method, such as environmental heuristics or static signature libraries, to attempt to ascertain whether the activity was benign or malicious and whether the activity meets its threshold for logging or prevention.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;

<h3 class="H2" id="sec4"><span id="h-8"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Sensors</samp></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">If telemetry represents the blips on the radar, then <i>sensors</i> are the transmitter, duplexer, and receiver: the components responsible for detecting objects and turning them into blips. Whereas radar systems constantly ping objects to track their movements, EDR sensors work a bit more passively by intercepting data flowing through an internal process, extracting information, and forwarding it to the central agent.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Because these sensors often need to sit inline of some system process, they must also work incredibly fast. Imagine that a sensor monitoring registry queries took 5 ms to perform its work before the registry operation was allowed to continue. That doesn’t sound like much of a problem until you consider that thousands of registry queries can occur per second on some systems. A 5 ms processing penalty applied to 1,000 events would introduce a five-second delay to system operations. Most users would find this unacceptable, driving customers away from using the EDR altogether.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Although Windows has numerous telemetry sources available, EDRs typically focus on only a select few. This is because certain sources may lack data quality or quantity, may not be relevant to host security, or may not be easily accessible. Some sensors are built into the operating system, such as the native event log. EDRs may also introduce their own sensor components to the system, such as drivers, function-hooking DLLs, and minifilters, which we’ll discuss in later chapters.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_4" aria-label=" Page 4. "/>Those of us on the offensive side of things mostly care about preventing, limiting, or normalizing (as in blending in with) the flow of telemetry collected by the sensor. The goal of this tactic is to reduce the number of datapoints that the product could use to create high-fidelity alerts or prevent our operation from executing. Essentially, we’re trying to generate a false negative. By understanding each of an EDR’s sensor components and the telemetry it can collect, we can make informed decisions about the tradecraft to use in certain situations and develop robust evasion strategies backed by data rather than anecdotal evidence.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H2" id="sec5"><span id="h-9"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Detections</samp></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Simply put, <i>detections</i> are the logic that correlates discrete pieces of telemetry with some behavior performed on the system. A detection can check for a singular condition (for example, the presence of a file whose hash matches that of known malware) or a complex sequence of events coming from many different sources (for example, that a child process of <i>chrome.exe</i> was spawned and then communicated over TCP port 88 with the domain controller).</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Typically, a detection engineer writes these rules based on the available sensors. Some detection engineers work for the EDR vendor and so must carefully consider scale, as the detection will likely affect a substantial number of organizations. On the other hand, detection engineers working within an organization can build rules that extend the EDR’s capabilities beyond those that the vendor provides to tailor their detection to the needs of their environment.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">An EDR’s detection logic usually exists in the agent and its subordinate sensors or in the backend collection system (the system to which all agents in the enterprise report). Sometimes it is found in some combination of the two. There are pros and cons to each approach. A detection implemented in the agent or its sensors may allow the EDR to take immediate preventive action but won’t provide it with the ability to analyze a complex situation. By contrast, a detection implemented at the backend collection system can support a huge set of detection rules but introduces delays to any preventive action taken.</p>&#13;

<h2 class="H1" id="sec6"><span id="h-10"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">The Challenges of EDR Evasion</samp></h2>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Many adversaries rely on bypasses described anecdotally or in public proofs of concept to avoid detection on a target’s systems. This approach can be problematic for a number of reasons.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">First, those public bypasses only work if an EDR’s capabilities stay the same over time and across different organizations. This isn’t a huge issue for internal red teams, which likely encounter the same product deployed across their entire environment. For consultants and malicious threat actors, however, the evolution of EDR products poses a significant headache, as each environment’s software has its own configuration, heuristics, <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_5" aria-label=" Page 5. "/>and alert logic. For example, an EDR might not scrutinize the execution of PsExec, a Windows remote-administration tool, in one organization if its use there is commonplace. But another organization might rarely use the tool, so its execution might indicate malicious activity.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Second, these public evasion tools, blog posts, and papers often use the term <i>bypass</i> loosely. In many cases, their authors haven’t determined whether the EDR merely allowed some action to occur or didn’t detect it at all. Sometimes, rather than automatically blocking an action, an EDR triggers alerts that require human interaction, introducing a delay to the response. (Imagine that the alert fired at 3 <small>AM</small> on a Saturday, allowing the attacker to continue moving through the environment.) Most attackers hope to completely evade detection, as a mature security operations center (SOC) can efficiently hunt down the source of any malicious activity once an EDR detects it. This can be catastrophic to an attacker’s mission.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Third, researchers who disclose new techniques typically don’t name the products they tested, for a number of reasons. For instance, they might have signed a nondisclosure agreement with a client or worry that the affected vendor will threaten legal action. Consequentially, those researchers may think that some technique can bypass all EDRs instead of only a certain product and configuration. For example, a technique might evade user-mode function hooking in one product because the product happens not to monitor the targeted function, but another product might implement a hook that would detect the malicious API call.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Finally, researchers might not clarify which component of the EDR their technique evades. Modern EDRs are complex pieces of software with many sensor components, each of which can be bypassed in its own way. For example, an EDR might track suspicious parent–child process relationships by obtaining data from a kernel-mode driver, Event Tracing for Windows (ETW), function hooks, and a number of other sources. If an evasion technique targets an EDR agent that relies on ETW to collect its data, it may not work against a product that leverages its driver for the same purpose.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">To effectively evade EDR, then, adversaries need a detailed understanding of how these tools work. The rest of this chapter dives into their components and structure.</p>&#13;

<h2 class="H1" id="sec7"><span id="h-11"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Identifying Malicious Activity</samp></h2>&#13;
<p class="TNI">To build successful detections, an engineer must understand more than the latest attacker tactics; they must also know how a business operates and what an attacker’s objectives might be. Then they must take the distinct and potentially unrelated datapoints gleaned from an EDR’s sensors and identify clusters of activity that could indicate something malicious happening on the system. This is much easier said than done.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">For example, does the creation of a new service indicate that an adversary has installed malware persistently on the system? Potentially, but it’s more likely that the user installed new software for legitimate reasons. What <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_6" aria-label=" Page 6. "/>if the service was installed at 3 <small>AM</small>? Suspicious, but maybe the user is burning the midnight oil on a big project. How about if <i>rundll32.exe</i>, the native Windows application for executing DLLs, is the process responsible for installing the service? Your gut reaction may be to say, “Aha! We’ve got you now!” Still, the functionality could be part of a legitimate but poorly implemented installer. Deriving intent from actions can be extremely difficult.</p>&#13;

<p class="TX">This contrived example shows the ambiguity involved in determining intent based on the actions taken on a system. Remember that the overwhelming majority of activities on a system are benign, assuming that something horrible hasn’t happened. Engineers must determine how sensitive an EDR’s detections should be (in other words, how much they should skew toward saying something is malicious) based on how many false negatives the customer can tolerate.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">One way that a product can meet its customers’ needs is by using a combination of so-called brittle and robust detections.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec9">&#13;
<h3 class="H2" id="sec9"><span id="h-13"/><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_7" aria-label=" Page 7. "/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Applying Brittle vs. Robust Detections</samp></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI"><i>Brittle</i> detections are those designed to detect a specific artifact, such as a simple string or hash-based signature commonly associated with known malware. <i>Robust</i> detections aim to detect behaviors and could be backed by machine-learning models trained for the environment. Both detection types have a place in modern scanning engines, as they help balance false positives and false negatives.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">For example, a detection built around the hash of a malicious file will very effectively detect a specific version of that one file, but any slight variation to the file will change its hash, causing the detection rule to fail. This is why we call such rules “brittle.” They are extremely specific, often targeting a single artifact. This means that the likelihood of a false positive is almost nonexistent while the likelihood of a false negative is very high.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Despite their flaws, these detections offer distinct benefits to security teams. They are easy to develop and maintain, so engineers can change them rapidly as the organization’s needs evolve. They can also effectively detect some common attacks. For example, a single rule for detecting an unmodified version of the exploitation tool Mimikatz brings tremendous value, as its false-positive rate is nearly zero and the likelihood of the tool being used maliciously is high.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Even so, the detection engineer must carefully consider what data to use when creating their brittle detections. If an attacker can trivially modify the indicator, the detection becomes much easier to evade. For example, say that a detection checks for the filename <i>mimikatz.exe</i>; an adversary could simply change the filename to <i>mimidogz.exe</i> and bypass the detection logic. For this reason, the best brittle detections target attributes that are either immutable or at least difficult to modify.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">On the other end of the spectrum, a robust ruleset backed by a machine-learning model might flag the modified file as suspicious because it is unique to the environment or contains some attribute that the classification algorithm weighted highly. Most robust detections are simply rules that more broadly try to target a technique. These types of detections exchange their specificity for the ability to detect an attack more generally, reducing the likelihood of false negatives by increasing the likelihood of false positives.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">While the industry tends to favor robust detections, they have their own drawbacks. Compared to brittle signatures, these rules can be much harder to develop due to their complexity. Additionally, the detection engineer must consider an organization’s false-positive tolerance. If their detection has a very low false-negative rate but a high false-positive rate, the EDR will behave like the boy who cried wolf. If they go too far in their attempts to reduce false positives, they may also increase the rate of false negatives, allowing an attack to go unnoticed.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Because of this, most EDRs employ a hybrid approach, using brittle signatures to catch obvious threats and robust detections to detect attacker techniques more generally.</p>&#13;

<p class="TNI">One of the only EDR vendors to publicly release its detection rules is Elastic, which publishes its SIEM rules in a GitHub repository. Let’s take a peek behind the curtain, as these rules contain great examples of both brittle and robust detections.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">For example, consider Elastic’s rule for detecting Kerberoasting attempts that use Bifrost, a macOS tool for interacting with Kerberos, shown in <a href="#list1-1">Listing 1-1</a>. <i>Kerberoasting</i> is the technique of retrieving Kerberos tickets and cracking them to uncover service account credentials.</p>&#13;
<pre id="list1-1"><code>query = '''&#13;
  event.category:process and event.type:start and&#13;
 process.args:("-action" and ("-kerberoast" or askhash or asktgs or asktgt or s4u or ("-ticket"&#13;
  and ptt) or (dump and (tickets or keytab))))&#13;
  '''</code></pre>&#13;
<p class="CodeListingCaptionWide"><span class="eSANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11a">Listing 1-1: Elastic’s rule for detecting Kerberoasting based on command line arguments</span></p>&#13;
<p class="TX">This rule checks for the presence of certain command line arguments that Bifrost supports. An attacker could trivially bypass this detection by renaming the arguments in the source code (for example, changing <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">-action</samp> to <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">-dothis</samp>) and then recompiling the tool. Additionally, a false positive could occur if an unrelated tool supports the arguments listed in the rule.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">For these reasons, the rule might seem like a bad detection. But remember that not all adversaries operate at the same level. Many threat groups continue to use off-the-shelf tooling. This detection serves to catch those who are using the basic version of Bifrost and nothing more.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Because of the rule’s narrow focus, Elastic should supplement it with a more robust detection that covers these gaps. Thankfully, the vendor published a complementary rule, shown in <a href="#list1-2">Listing 1-2</a>.</p>&#13;

<p class="CodeListingCaptionWide"><span class="eSANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11a">Listing 1-2: Elastic’s rule for detecting atypical processes communicating over TCP port 88</span></p>&#13;
<p class="TX">This rule targets atypical processes that make outbound connections to TCP port 88, the standard Kerberos port. While this rule contains some gaps to address false positives, it’s generally more robust than the brittle detection for Bifrost. Even if the adversary were to rename parameters and recompile the tool, the network behavior inherent to Kerberoasting would cause this rule to fire.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_9" aria-label=" Page 9. "/>To evade detection, the adversary could take advantage of the exemption list included at the bottom of the rule, perhaps changing Bifrost’s name to match one of those files, such as <i>opera.exe</i>. If the adversary also modified the tool’s command line arguments, they would evade both the brittle and robust detections covered here.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Most EDR agents strive for a balance between brittle and robust detections but do so in an opaque way, so an organization might find it very difficult to ensure coverage, especially in agents that don’t support the introduction of custom rules. For this reason, a team’s detection engineers should test and validate detections using tooling such as Red Canary’s Atomic Test Harnesses.</p>&#13;

<h2 class="H1" id="sec11"><span id="h-15"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Agent Design</samp></h2>&#13;
<p class="TNI">As attackers, we should pay close attention to the EDR agent deployed on the endpoints we’re targeting because this is the component responsible for detecting the activities we’ll use to complete our operation. In this section, we’ll review the parts of an agent and the various design choices they might make.</p>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec12">&#13;
<h3 class="H2" id="sec12"><span id="h-16"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Basic</samp></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Agents are composed of distinct parts, each of which has its own objective and type of telemetry it is able to collect. Most commonly, agents include the following components:</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara"><b>The static scanner</b>   An application, or component of the agent itself, that performs static analysis of images, such as Portable Executable (PE) files or arbitrary ranges of virtual memory, to determine whether the content is malicious. Static scanners commonly form the backbone of antivirus services.</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara"><b>The hooking DLL</b>   A DLL that is responsible for intercepting calls to specific application programming interface (API) functions. <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter2.xhtml">Chapter 2</a></span> covers function hooking in detail.</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara"><b>The kernel driver</b>   A kernel-mode driver responsible for injecting the hooking DLL into target processes and collecting kernel-specific telemetry. <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter3.xhtml">Chapters 3</a> through <a href="chapter7.xhtml">7</a></span> cover its various detection techniques.</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara"><b>The agent service</b>   An application responsible for aggregating telemetry created by the preceding two components. It sometimes correlates data or generates alerts. Then it relays the collected data to a centralized EDR server.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX"><a href="#fig1-2">Figure 1-2</a> shows the most basic agent architecture that commercial products use today.</p>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img id="fig1-2" class="img100" src="../images/Figure1-2.png" alt=""/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 1-2: The basic agent architecture</samp></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">As we can see here, this basic design doesn’t have many sources of telemetry. Its three sensors (a scanner, a driver, and a function-hooking DLL) provide the agent with data about process-creation events, the invocation of functions deemed sensitive (such as <samp class="SANS_TheSansMonoCd_W5Regular_11">kernel32!CreateRemoteThread</samp>), <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_10" aria-label=" Page 10. "/>the signatures of files, and potentially the virtual memory belonging to a process. This may be sufficient coverage for some use cases, but most commercial EDR products today go far beyond these capabilities. For instance, this basic EDR would be incapable of detecting files being created, deleted, or encrypted on the host.</p>&#13;
</section>&#13;
<section epub:type="division" aria-labelledby="sec13">&#13;
<h3 class="H2" id="sec13"><span id="h-17"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Intermediate</samp></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">While a basic agent can collect a large amount of valuable data with which to create detections, this data may not form a complete picture of the activities performed on the host. Usually, the endpoint security products deployed in enterprise environments today have substantially expanded their capabilities to collect additional telemetry.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Most of the agents that attackers encounter fall into the intermediate level of sophistication. These agents not only introduce new sensors but also use telemetry sources native to the operating system. Additions commonly made at this level may include the following:</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara"><b>Network filter drivers</b>   Drivers that perform network traffic analysis to identify indicators of malicious activity, such as beaconing. These will be covered in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter7.xhtml">Chapter 7</a></span>.</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara"><b>Filesystem filter drivers</b>   A special type of driver that can monitor for operations on the host filesystem. They are discussed extensively in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter6.xhtml">Chapter 6</a></span>.</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara"><b>ETW consumers</b>   Components of the agent that can subscribe to events created by the host operating system or third-party applications. ETW is covered in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter8.xhtml">Chapter 8</a></span>.</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_11" aria-label=" Page 11. "/><b>Early Launch Antimalware (ELAM) components</b>   Features that provide a Microsoft-supported mechanism for loading an antimalware driver before other boot-start services to control the initialization of the other boot drivers. These components also grant the ability to receive Secure ETW events, a special type of event generated from a group of protected event providers. These functions of ELAM drivers are covered in <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter11.xhtml">Chapter 11</a></span> and <span class="Xref"><a href="chapter12.xhtml">Chapter 12</a></span>.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">While modern EDRs may not implement all of these components, you’ll commonly see the ELAM driver deployed alongside the primary kernel driver. <a href="#fig1-3">Figure 1-3</a> illustrates what a more modern agent architecture may look like.</p>&#13;
<figure class="IMG"><img id="fig1-3" class="img100" src="../images/Figure1-3.png" alt=""/>&#13;
<figcaption><p class="CAP"><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Book_Oblique_I_11">Figure 1-3: The intermediate agent architecture</samp></p></figcaption>&#13;
</figure>&#13;
<p class="TX">This design builds upon the basic architecture and adds many new sensors from which telemetry can be collected. For instance, this EDR can now monitor filesystem events such as file creation, consume from ETW providers that offer data the agent wouldn’t otherwise be able to collect, and observe network communications on the host through its filter driver, potentially allowing the agent to detect command-and-control beaconing activity. It also adds a layer of redundancy so that if one sensor fails, another might be able to pick up the slack.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="H2" id="sec14"><span id="h-18"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_Condensed_Oblique_BI_11">Advanced</samp></h3>&#13;
<p class="TNI">Some products implement more advanced features to monitor specific areas of the system in which they’re interested. Here are two examples of such features:</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara"><b>Hypervisors</b>   Provide a method for the interception of system calls, the virtualization of certain system components, and the sandboxing of code execution. These also provide the agent with a way to monitor transitions in execution between the guest and host. They’re commonly leveraged as a component of anti-ransomware and anti-exploit functionality.</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara"><span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_12" aria-label=" Page 12. "/><b>Adversary deception</b>   Provides false data to the adversary instead of preventing the malicious code’s execution. This may cause the adversary to focus on debugging their tooling without realizing that the data in use has been tampered with.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Because these are typically product-specific implementations and are not commonplace at the time of this writing, we won’t discuss these advanced features in significant detail. Additionally, many of the components in this category align more closely with prevention strategies rather than detection, pushing them slightly outside the scope of this book. As time goes on, however, some advanced features may become more common, and new ones will likely be invented.</p>&#13;

<h2 class="H1" id="sec15"><span id="h-19"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Types of Bypasses</samp></h2>&#13;
<p class="TNI">In his 2021 blog post “Evadere Classifications,” Jonathan Johnson groups evasions based on the location in the detection pipeline where they occur. Using the Funnel of Fidelity, a concept put forth by Jared Atkinson to describe phases of the detection and response pipeline, Johnson defines areas where an evasion can occur. The following are the ones we’ll discuss in later chapters:</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara"><b>Configuration bypass</b>   Occurs when there is a telemetry source on the endpoint that could identify the malicious activity, but the sensor failed to collect data from it, leading to a gap in coverage. For example, even if the sensor is able to collect events from a specific ETW provider related to Kerberos authentication activity, it might not be configured to do so.</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara"><b>Perceptual bypass</b>   Occurs when the sensor or agent lacks the capability to collect the relevant telemetry. For example, the agent might not monitor filesystem interactions.</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara"><b>Logical bypass</b>   Occurs when the adversary abuses a gap in a detection’s logic. For example, a detection might contain a known gap that no other detection covers.</p>&#13;
<p class="RunInPara"><b>Classification bypass</b>   Occurs when the sensor or agent is unable to identify enough datapoints to classify the attacker’s behavior as malicious, despite observing it. For example, the attacker’s traffic might blend into normal network traffic.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Configuration bypasses are one of the most common techniques. Sometimes they are even used unknowingly, as most mature EDR agents have the ability to collect certain telemetry but fail to do so for one reason or another, such as to reduce event volume. Perceptual bypasses are generally the most valuable because if the data doesn’t exist and no compensating components cover the gap, the EDR has no chance of detecting the attacker’s activities.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Logical bypasses are the trickiest to pull off because they generally require knowledge of the detection’s underlying logic. Lastly, classification bypasses require a bit of forethought and system profiling, but red teams <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_13" aria-label=" Page 13. "/>use them frequently (for example, by beaconing over a slow HTTPS channel to a reputable site for their command-and-control activities). When executed well, classification bypasses can approach the efficacy of a perceptual bypass for less work than that required for a logical bypass.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">On the defense side, these classifications let us discuss blind spots in our detection strategies with greater specificity. For instance, if we require that events be forwarded from the endpoint agent to the central collection server for analysis, our detection is inherently vulnerable to a configuration evasion, as an attacker could potentially change the agent’s configuration in such a way that the agent–server communication channel is interrupted.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Perceptual bypasses are important to understand but are often the hardest to find. If our EDR simply lacks the ability to collect the required data, we have no choice but to find another way to build our detection. Logical bypasses happen due to decisions made when building the detection rules. Because SOCs aren’t staffed with an infinite number of analysts who can review alerts, engineers always seek to reduce false positives. But for every exemption they make in a rule, they inherit the potential for a logical bypass. Consider Elastic’s robust Kerberoasting rule described earlier and how an adversary could simply change the name of their tool to evade it.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Finally, classification evasions can be the trickiest to protect against. To do so, engineers must continue to tune the EDR’s detection threshold until it’s just right. Take command-and-control beaconing as an example. Say we build our detection strategy by assuming that an attacker will connect to a site with an uncategorized reputation at a rate greater than one request per minute. In what way could our adversary fly under the radar? Well, they might beacon through an established domain or slow their callback interval to once every two minutes.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">In response, we could change our rule to look for domains to which the system hasn’t previously connected, or we could increase the beaconing interval. But remember that we’d risk receiving more false positives. Engineers will continue to perform this dance as they strive to optimize their detection strategies to balance the tolerances of their organizations with the capabilities of their adversaries.</p>&#13;

<h2 class="H1" id="sec16"><span id="h-20"/><samp class="SANS_Futura_Std_Bold_B_11">Linking Evasion Techniques: An Example Attack</samp></h2>&#13;
<p class="TNI">There is typically more than one way to collect a piece of telemetry. For example, the EDR could monitor process-creation events using both a driver and an ETW consumer. This means that evasion isn’t a simple matter of finding a silver bullet. Rather, it’s the process of abusing gaps in a sensor to fly under the threshold at which the EDR generates an alert or takes preventive action.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Consider <a href="#tab1-2">Table 1-2</a>, which describes a contrived classification system designed to catch command-and-control agent operations. In this example, any actions occurring within some window of time whose cumulative score is greater than or equal to 500 will cause a high-severity alert. A score higher than 750 will cause the offending process and its children to be terminated.</p>&#13;

<p class="TX">An attacker could bypass each of these activities individually, but when they’re combined, evasion becomes much more difficult. How could we chain evasion techniques to avoid triggering the detection logic?</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Starting with configuration evasions, let’s imagine that the agent lacks a network-inspection sensor, so it can’t correlate outgoing network traffic with a client process. However, a compensating control may be present, such as an ETW consumer for the Microsoft-Windows-WebIO provider. In that case, we might opt to use a browser as a host process or employ another protocol, such as DNS, for command and control. We might also use a logical evasion to subvert the “atypical child process” detection by matching typical parent–child relationships on the system. For a perceptual evasion, let’s say that the agent lacks the ability to scan memory allocations to see if they’re backed by an image. As attackers, we won’t need to worry at all about being detected based on this indicator.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Let’s put this all together to describe how an attack might proceed. First, we could exploit an email client to achieve code execution under the context of that process. Because this mail-client binary is a legitimate product that existed on the system prior to compromise, we can reasonably assume that it is signed or has a signing exclusion. We’ll send and receive command-and-control traffic over HTTP, which triggers the detection for a non-browser process communicating over HTTP, bringing the current risk score up to 100.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">Next, we need to spawn a sacrificial process at some point to perform our post-exploitation actions. Our tooling is written in PowerShell, but rather than spawning <i>powershell.exe</i>, which would be atypical and trigger an alert by bringing our risk score to 500, we instead spawn a new instance of the email client as a child process and use Unmanaged PowerShell to execute our tooling inside it. Our agent allocates a read-write-execute buffer in the child process, however, raising our risk score to 300.</p>&#13;
<p class="TX">We receive the output from our tool and determine that we need to run another tool to perform some action to further our access. At this point, any additional detections will raise our risk score to 500 or greater, potentially burning our operation, so we have some decisions to make. Here are a few options:</p>&#13;
<ul class="BL">&#13;
<li class="BL">Execute the post-exploitation tooling and accept the detection. After the alert, we could move very quickly in an attempt to outpace the response, hope for an ineffective response process that fails to <span role="doc-pagebreak" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pg_15" aria-label=" Page 15. "/>eradicate us, or be okay with burning the operation and starting over again if needed.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Wait for some period of time before executing our tooling. Because the agent correlates only those events that occur within some window of time, we can simply wait until the state recycles, resetting our risk score to zero, and continue the operation from there.</li>&#13;
<li class="BL">Find another method of execution. This could range from simply dropping our script on the target and executing it there, to proxying in the post-exploitation tool’s traffic to reduce most of the host-based indicators it would create.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="TX">Whatever we choose, our goal is clear: stay below the alerting threshold for as long as possible. By calculating the risks of each action that we need to perform, understanding the indicators our activities create, and using a combination of evasion tactics, we can evade an EDR’s complex detection systems. Note that no single evasion worked universally in this example. Rather, a combination of evasions targeted the most relevant detections for the task at hand.</p>&#13;

<p class="TNI">In summary, an EDR agent is composed of any number of sensors that are responsible for collecting telemetry related to activity on the system. The EDR applies its own rules or detection logic across this data to pick out what things might indicate a malicious actor’s presence. Each of these sensors is susceptible to evasion in some way, and it is our job to identify those blind spots and either abuse them or compensate for them.</p>&#13;

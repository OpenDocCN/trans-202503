<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">I</span>n mid-May of 2010, I walked into building 44 on the Google campus for my first day on the Android team. Not far from my desk were at least a half-dozen machines for brewing a wide variety of great, strong coffee. I was surprised at the focus on caffeine, but not for long.</p>
<p>The team was finishing up one release<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnote-4" id="f08-footnoteref-4">1</a></sup> while starting work on the next one<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnote-5" id="f08-footnoteref-5">2</a></sup> in parallel. Both were difficult, time-consuming, and critical as we tried to make Android relevant in the crowded smartphone market at that time. There was a constant feeling of racing furiously toward a goal, doing whatever we could to reach it and not knowing if we would. The pace was frantic, but the work was exhilarating—and not just because of the caffeine. The excitement came from being on a team singularly dedicated to its purpose, no matter how much effort it took. </p>
<p>Working on Android was a stark difference from where my career began.</p>
<p>I started my work life with a nine-to-five job at a conservative old firm in Minnesota. The company relied on people sticking around for their entire careers and beyond, offering retirees a free turkey every Thanksgiving. I was all set; I just needed to clock in my forty hours a week and rise slowly through the ranks until I was ready for my retirement and my turkey.</p>
<p>Within a year, I was bored out of my mind, and within two I’d left for graduate school, to reboot my skills into something I actually enjoyed: computer <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xx" title="xx"/>graphics programming. After grad school, I headed to Silicon Valley, the land of tech opportunity.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnote-6" id="f08-footnoteref-6">3</a></sup> I joined Sun Microsystems, where I thrived for the next couple of years . . . until another interesting job beckoned.</p>
<p>I spent the next several years moving from company to company as other jobs, technologies, and people offered a continually shifting variety in my tech life. I worked at Sun (a few different times), Anyware Fast (a contracting company started by a couple of friends), DimensionX (an early web startup acquired by Microsoft), Intel, Rendition (a 3D chip startup acquired by Micron), and Adobe.</p>
<p>My father, who retired from the US Navy after 21 years, was never comfortable with my frequent job changes. What about a pension? What about job security? What about stability for my family?</p>
<p>What he didn’t see was that this was the way things were, and are, in Silicon Valley, and increasingly in high tech everywhere. For every job I started, I built a new set of skills that contributed to future prospects and products. That same attitude, and reality, applies to all of the engineers shifting between tech firms; we’re building skills that we’ll continue to draw from as we move around creating all kinds of products. It’s exactly these diverse backgrounds that contribute much-needed skills to new projects, to tackle unknown problems and deliver innovative solutions.</p>
<p>In 2010, another opportunity presented itself. Romain Guy, a friend whom I’d worked with (and authored a book with<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnote-7" id="f08-footnoteref-7">4</a></sup>) when he was an intern at Sun in 2005, had a problem. He had joined the Android team in 2007 and was too busy to write the animation system that he knew was needed. But he knew me, and he knew that that’s the kind of project I love. Several interviews and five months later, I joined Android’s UI toolkit team in building 44 on the Google campus in Mountain View and started working harder than I ever had before.</p>
<p>I began by creating the new animation system, then worked on low-level performance and graphics software as we labored to finish the upcoming <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxi" title="xxi"/>release. I continued working on that same team for many years, writing graphics, performance, and user-interface code, and wound up leading the team for several years.</p>
<p>Most of my projects prior to Android were really enjoyable . . . but not very visible. If my family asked what I did, I’d tell them about the software I wrote. And then I’d describe in a hand-wavy way the kinds of applications that might use my software, because the reality was that they’d never see the results of my code. It just wasn’t stuff that real people (consumers) encountered in the real world.</p>
<p>Then I joined the Android team and I was writing software<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnote-8" id="f08-footnoteref-8">5</a></sup> that people across the world would use every single day. Or at least they would if Android managed to survive.</p>

<p class="BodyFirst">The early team at Android consisted of people with lots of experience and very strong opinions. They were confident in what they were trying to build, but they faced an uphill battle to get it to its initial 1.0 release.</p>
<p>The team’s goal was to create the Android operating system (OS). This included everything from the low-level kernel and hardware drivers to the overall platform software. It also entailed creating APIs for applications, tools to help build those applications, several applications to bundle with the platform, and services on the backend for those applications to communicate with. Oh, and they wanted to ship all of this with a new phone as well.</p>
<p>The software would be provided to manufacturers for free to build their own phones. These partners would build the hardware and Android would provide the software. The OS would help phone manufacturers by allowing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxii" title="xxii"/>them to focus on their hardware products, leaving the increasingly complex software problem up to Android. At the same time, Android would help application developers by creating a uniform platform across a variety of phones. Developers would be able to write a single version of their app for all of these devices, instead of requiring different versions for different devices.</p>
<p>The Android team had financial backing from Google, access to an internal pool of engineers experienced at writing software at a very large scale, a rapidly growing smartphone market, and a dedicated team working on the product until it was ready. How could it fail? It might seem, in hindsight, like Android’s success was a given. </p>
<p>But in the early days, the team was living in a very different reality, and Android’s continued existence was far more tenuous.</p>
<p>For one thing, the team might have had Google’s economic backing, but Android was just one of many projects that Google invested in. Google’s bet on Android wasn’t about Google putting its full weight behind it, but about the company sponsoring a team to see what was possible.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnote-9" id="f08-footnoteref-9">6</a></sup> </p>
<p>Also, Android was entering an industry with many entrenched competitors and no clear opening for new players. On the lower end of the market, there were numerous Nokia phones available worldwide. Danger, BlackBerry and Palm all offered interesting smartphone<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnote-10" id="f08-footnoteref-10">7</a></sup> options to their passionate and loyal users. And there were various Microsoft phones available. And anyone who’s worked in the software industry knows that you should always be wary of competing against Microsoft.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnote-11" id="f08-footnoteref-11">8</a></sup> </p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxiii" title="xxiii"/>Then Apple entered the market in 2007, unveiling yet another competitor in an already crowded field. Apple might have been new to mobile phones, but they already had a proven track record with operating systems, consumer computing devices, and their popular iPods.</p>
<p>All of these players were well-established before Android launched even a press release, much less a product.</p>
<p>To attempt to compete in this tough market, the early team focused with a singular drive on reaching 1.0. Everyone fixated on that goal, with most of them working non-stop during insane crunch periods.</p>
<p>But knowing they wanted to build this OS didn’t mean everyone agreed on <em>how</em> to build it, or that it would succeed, or even exactly what they were trying to build. Andy McFadden, an engineer on the team, said, “We had a lot of people with strong feelings about the right and wrong ways of doing things. Sometimes they disagreed, which got colorful at times.”</p>
<p>Even when Android reached 1.0 and the first Android phone shipped, it wasn’t obvious to people on the team that the project would succeed or even continue. Ryan Gibson, a technical program manager (TPM) on the team, said, “In those early years, the atmosphere within Android was that of an underdog, constantly on the brink of failure and having to work incredibly hard to eke out every inch of progress. Success was far from a foregone conclusion. We were a year behind. Had we slipped into the next year, we might have been a historic footnote rather than a viable alternative.”</p>
<p>Over the years since I joined the team, I heard about Android’s early development and difficulties, as everyone struggled to get the platform where it needed to be to compete. And then, during my time on the team, I saw Android achieve some measure of success, which begged the question: how? That is, what were the elements in Android’s development that led to its phenomenal growth since those early, tenuous years?</p>
<p>The idea to write this book began when I realized the story of Android’s development would eventually be lost as the people who built it moved on to other projects<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnote-12" id="f08-footnoteref-12">9</a></sup> and forgot what had happened. In 2017, I started to record conversations with people from the early team, to capture that story. </p>
<h2 id="h1-502680f08-0002"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxiv" title="xxiv"/>Implementation Details<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnote-13" id="f08-footnoteref-13">10</a></sup></h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">This is a long book (much longer than I thought it would be when I started writing it, though much, <em>much</em> shorter than my first draft. You’re welcome). Here are a couple tips for reading it, to make the organization of this large topic a bit clearer.</p>
<p>First, a note on the word <em>Android</em>. One of the things that had my editor tearing her hair out was my frequent use of the word <em>Android</em> to mean anything from the startup company, to the team after it was acquired by Google, to the software platform being built, to the phone product, to the open source code, to someone’s nickname.</p>
<p>The underlying problem here is . . . that’s the way the Android team used the word: It meant the company, it meant the department inside of Google, it meant the software, it meant the phones, it meant the ecosystem, it meant the team. </p>
<p>There’s an episode of <em>Rick and Morty</em><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnote-14" id="f08-footnoteref-14">11</a></sup> where inhabitants of a different planet use the word <em>squanch</em> in various seemingly unrelated ways. Eventually Rick explains, “Squanchy culture is more . . . contextual than literal. You just say what’s in your squanch and people understand.”</p>
<p>Android is like that. You just say what’s in your Android and people understand.</p>
<p>Second, the story is told in chronological order . . . ish. That is, I describe the things that happened and the people who did those things in a time-flows-forward fashion, because time is a helpful way to organize complex, interrelated things. However, it is impossible to actually tell the story in a strictly chronological way because so many things happened in parallel. So you’ll notice that the story may follow what someone worked on through 1.0 or beyond, and then the timeline might rewind to tell the story of someone else on the team.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxv" title="xxv"/>Speaking of time, the book’s story begins with the founding of Android and continues until late 2009. Most of it takes place in the time leading up to the 1.0 launch,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnote-15" id="f08-footnoteref-15">12</a></sup> in late 2008. By 1.0, most of the pieces that enabled Android’s future were already in place. The timeline stretches out another year, to the end of 2009, which is when the first glimpse of Android’s future success was visible, after the launch of the Motorola Droid in the US.</p>
<p>Finally, I want this book to be readable by everyone, not just software and hardware engineers who know (and, let’s face it, might actually care) about the technical details. I try hard to avoid the too-technical weeds, in the interest of not losing people along the way. But it’s impossible to describe how an OS was built without using terms like “OS” that may be unfamiliar to people who don’t happen to write code for a living. I try to define the terms as I go,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnote-16" id="f08-footnoteref-16">13</a></sup> but if you get stuck on a passage wondering what <em>APIs</em> are again, or what I mean by <em>CL</em>, check out the “Jargon” section in the appendix. </p>
<h2 id="h1-502680f08-0003">And So It Began</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">In August of 2017,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnote-17" id="f08-footnoteref-17">14</a></sup> I started having conversations with that early team, starting with a recorded lunchtime chat<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnote-18" id="f08-footnoteref-18">15</a></sup> with Dianne Hackborn and Romain Guy. I continued from there, interviewing (mostly in person, though sometimes over email) most of the people on the early team over the course of the next few years.</p>
<p>For in-person interviews (live or over video chat), I brought a recording microphone,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnote-19" id="f08-footnoteref-19">16</a></sup> realizing quickly that handwritten notes would not suffice. For one thing, people like Dan Sandler and Dianne Hackborn speak faster than <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxvi" title="xxvi"/>I can think, much less write. But also, recording the conversations allowed me to participate more than I could have if I were furiously scribbling notes.</p>
<p>I spent many hours having these conversations. Then, because written text is easier to refer back to and search than audio recordings, I spent many <em>more</em> hours transcribing the conversations into text documents.<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnote-20" id="f08-footnoteref-20">17</a></sup> As I did this, spending a lot of quality time listening to, transcribing, and reading these conversations, I realized a beautiful thing: the conversations weren’t just research for the book; they <em>were</em> the book. I had intended to use the interviews as background to help me understand the big picture, the chronology, and some of the details that I wouldn’t have discovered otherwise. But what I didn’t anticipate was how well everyone was going to tell the story, in their own words.</p>
<p>I use a lot of quotes from these interviews in this book. In fact, I use quotes instead of my description wherever I can, because the story is best told from the point of view of people who were there, each in their own voice and with their own unique take on the events.</p>
<p>Please join me for this journey into the heart of Android for the story of how the team and the OS came to be, through the voices of the people who made it all happen.</p>

<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnoteref-8" id="f08-footnote-8">5.</a></sup>  And bugs. The only code that doesn’t have bugs is code that is not yet written. We test as much as we can, but the complexity of modern software systems means that there will always be bugs. The trick is to make sure the bugs are not critical, and that we fix them when they are found. Then we can get back to writing more code (and more bugs).</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnoteref-9" id="f08-footnote-9">6.</a></sup>  Google was taking similar strategic bets around the same time in web technologies, as it started building its own browser (Chrome), knowing that it needed to at least explore these spaces as a hedge against other companies potentially owning them in the future.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnoteref-10" id="f08-footnote-10">7.</a></sup>  Here I am using a very broad definition of the term “smartphone.” When the term was first used, it meant, essentially, a phone plus data, which allowed for more communication through things like email and instant messaging; basically a richer communication device. Today, a smartphone encompasses much more than these fundamental pieces, including things like apps, games, touchscreens, and the plethora of technologies that have come online since a phone was first married to a data plan.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnoteref-11" id="f08-footnote-11">8.</a></sup>  Bob Borchers, the director of product marketing for the original iPhone, observed: “You never count out Microsoft.

<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnoteref-13" id="f08-footnote-13">10.</a></sup>  “Implementation details” is a phrase heard often in engineering discussions, when someone wants to focus on the larger ideas without getting bogged down in the tedious details of how the thing will actually be written. Of course, the implementation and completion of a software project is actually the difficult and time-consuming part, so it’s like pretending that the tip of the iceberg would be floating just fine on its own without the rest of that thing below the surface.</p></aside>

<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnoteref-16" id="f08-footnote-16">13.</a></sup>  I make generous use of footnotes. You should, too.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnoteref-17" id="f08-footnote-17">14.</a></sup>  As I read through this section again, in February of 2021, nearing the end of another (but not the last) long editing phase, I realized that I have spent longer writing the story of Android than the team spent building the entire operating system and shipping the 1.0 product.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnoteref-18" id="f08-footnote-18">15.</a></sup>  Interviewing pro tip: When recording conversations, don’t do it over lunch or you will end up spending too much time later re-listening to everyone chewing.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnoteref-19" id="f08-footnote-19">16.</a></sup>  I also often brought my friend and colleague Romain Guy, who was one of those early team members and who helped me organize and conduct many of the interviews.</p></aside>
<aside class="FootnoteEntry"><p><sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#f08-footnoteref-20" id="f08-footnote-20">17.</a></sup>  Another interviewing pro tip: If you ever have to do this, get software that lets you play back audio at a speed that’s closer to your typing speed. For me, it was about 40 percent of the real-time speed, depending on the person I was interviewing. The only downside with this approach was that, at that much slower speed, everyone in the conversation sounds drunk.Even better: always wait for technology to catch up. In 2020, when I was recording a final handful of conversations, Google launched an Android app that records audio and creates a transcription automatically. You have to love the pace of technology, except when it’s almost too late to be useful.</p></aside>

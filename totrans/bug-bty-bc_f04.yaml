    know that you’re coming aboard at one of the most exciting times in the industry’s
    history. This community is growing faster than ever before, as governments are
    beginning to require that companies host vulnerability disclosure programs, Fortune
    500 companies are building such policies in droves, and the applications for hacker-powered
    security are expanding every day. The value of a human eye will forever be vital
    in defending against evolving threats, and the world is recognizing *us* as the
    people to provide it.

- en: The beautiful thing about the bug bounty world is that, unlike your typical
    nine-to-five job or consultancy gig, it allows you to participate from wherever
    you want, whenever you want, and on whatever type of asset you like! All you need
    is a decent internet connection, a nice coffee (or your choice of beverage), some
    curiosity, and a passion for breaking things. And not only does it give you the
    freedom to work on your own schedule, but the threats are evolving faster than
    the speed of innovation, providing ample opportunities to learn, build your skills,
    and become an expert in a new area.

- en: If you are interested in gaining real-world hacking experience, the bug bounty
    marketplace makes that possible by providing an endless number of targets owned
    by giant companies such as Facebook, Google, or Apple! I’m not saying that it
    is an easy task to find a vulnerability in these companies; nevertheless, bug
    bounty programs deliver the platform on which to hunt, and the bug bounty community
    pushes you to learn more about new vulnerability types, grow your skill set, and
    keep trying even when it gets tough. Unlike most labs and Capture the Flags (CTFs),
    bug bounty programs do not have solutions or a guaranteed vulnerability to exploit.
    Instead, you’ll always ask yourself whether or not some feature is vulnerable,
    or if it can force the application or its functionalities to do things it’s not
    supposed to. This uncertainty can be daunting, but it makes the thrill of finding
    a bug so much sweeter.

    advance your understanding of web application hacking. She covers the skills that
    will make you a successful bug bounty hunter, including step-by-step analyses
    on how to pick the right program for you, perform proper reconnaissance, and write
    strong reports. She provides explanations for attacks like cross-site scripting,
    SQL injection, template injection, and almost any other you need in your toolkit
    to be successful. Later on, she takes you beyond the basics of web applications
    and introduces topics such as code review, API hacking, automating your workflow,
    and fuzzing.

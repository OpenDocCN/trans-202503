    It costs next to nothing to reach tens of thousands of people, so it doesn’t matter

    example, one popular scam informs the recipient that their computer was “hacked”
    and that sexually explicit photos have been found; a cryptocurrency payment is
    required to prevent the pictures from being distributed to coworkers, family,
    and friends. The story is a fabrication, and in most circumstances, not a convincing
    one. Most of us probably don’t have embarrassing nudes on our computers, or if
    we do, we might not be particularly frightened by the threat. But to a kindergarten
    teacher or a member of the clergy who recalls snapping some naughty selfies a
    while back, this could be a profoundly sickening message to read. And in a moment

    response and should be researched first. You can hang up, close the browser window,

    from other folks who have had similar encounters. If the message purportedly came
    from the bank, it’s best to call them back at the number on the billing statements

    many criminals exploit our instinct to comply with orders and desire to follow
    convention; for example, if they holler at you, you might be compelled to stop
    and let them close the distance—even if objectively, it’d make more sense to bail.
    Not being afraid to make an undignified retreat or raise your voice is a good
    survival strategy; so is maintaining keen situational awareness and avoiding getting
    lost in thought, especially in awkward transitional spaces such as back alleys,
    pedestrian underpasses and overpasses, empty gas stations, and so forth. Finally,
    it can be helpful to have several $10 or $20 bills in your pocket, and keep vital
    documents, credit cards, and keepsakes somewhere else.

    be the option of last resort. To momentarily take control of the situation, it
    may be useful to say or do something that’s nonthreatening but catches the assailant
    off guard. Feigning a panic attack or saying something completely unexpected (“Hey,
    are you a friend of CJ’s? Pretty sure we met last year!”) can give you a second
    or two to pull out a can of pepper spray or start running as fast as you can.

    similar statutes in different parts of the country—or even in different parts
    of the same state. A resident of San Francisco who kills or severely injuries
    an unarmed burglar may spend the night in jail as the prosecutor combs through

    or in a purse. Inner pockets of jackets, and chest- or knee-level pockets of pants
    and shirts, are much harder to muck with. Slim, discreet waist packs or under-the-garment
    neck wallets work even better. They enjoyed popularity in the 1980s and 1990s
    before becoming extremely uncool—but now, retro fashion is all the rage again.

    anyone. But it also must be said that some life choices increase the likelihood
    of being singled out in retaliation for your perceived misdeeds.

    increases the odds of criminal injury, regardless of whether you think your actions
    are defensible in court. One of the wronged people may sooner or later lose it
    and take justice into their own hands. In other words, be kind and considerate
    in your personal life, and judicious in your business pursuits. This isn’t just
    good manners, but a very real survival skill.

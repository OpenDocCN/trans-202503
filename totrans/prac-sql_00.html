<p class="ChapterIntro">Shortly after joining the staff of <em>USA Today</em>, I received a dataset that I would analyze almost every week for the next decade. It was the weekly Best-Selling Books list, which ranked the nation’s top-selling titles based on confidential sales data. Not only did the list produce an endless stream of story ideas to pitch, it also captured the zeitgeist of America in a singular way.</p>&#13;
<p>Did you know that cookbooks sell a bit more during the week of Mother’s Day or that Oprah Winfrey turned many obscure writers into number-one best-selling authors just by having them on her show? Every week, the book list editor and I pored over the sales figures and book genres, ranking the data in search of a new headline. Rarely did we come up empty: we chronicled everything from the rocket-rise of the blockbuster <em>Harry Potter</em> series to the fact that <em>Oh, the Places You’ll Go!</em> by Dr. Seuss had become a perennial gift for new graduates.</p>&#13;
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xxiv" id="Page_xxiv"/>My technical companion in that time was the database programming language <em>SQL</em> (for <em>Structured Query Language</em>). Early on, I convinced <em>USA Today</em>’s IT department to grant me access to the SQL-based database system that powered our book list application. Using SQL, I was able to discover the stories hidden in the database, which contained sales data related to titles, authors, genres, and the codes that defined the publishing world.</p>&#13;
<p>SQL has been useful to me ever since, whether my role was in product development, in content strategy, or, lately, as a data editor for the<em> Wall Street Journal</em>. In each case, SQL has helped me find interesting stories in data—and that’s exactly what you’ll learn to do using this book.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-501065f06-0001">What Is SQL?</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">SQL is a widely used programming language for managing data and database systems. Whether you’re a marketing analyst, a journalist, or a researcher mapping neurons in the brain of a fruit fly, you’ll benefit from using SQL to collect, modify, explore, and summarize data.</p>&#13;
<p>Because SQL is a mature language that’s been around for decades, it’s ingrained in many modern systems. A pair of IBM researchers first outlined the syntax for SQL (then called SEQUEL) in a 1974 paper, building on the theoretical work of the British computer scientist Edgar F. Codd. In 1979, a precursor to the database company Oracle (then called Relational Software) became the first to use the language in a commercial product. Today, SQL still ranks as one of the most-used computer languages in the world, and that’s unlikely to change soon.</p>&#13;
<p>Each database system, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server, implements its own variant of SQL, so you’ll notice subtle—or sometimes significant—differences in syntax if you jump from one system to another. There are several reasons behind this. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) adopted a standard for SQL in 1986, followed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. But the standard doesn’t cover all aspects of SQL that are required for a database implementation—for example, it has no entry for creating indexes. That leaves each database system maker to choose how to implement features the standard doesn’t cover—and no database maker currently claims to conform to the entire standard.</p>&#13;
<p>Meanwhile, business considerations can lead commercial database vendors to create nonstandard SQL features for both competitive advantage and as a way to keep users in their ecosystem. For example, Microsoft’s SQL Server uses the proprietary Transact-SQL (T-SQL) that includes a number of features not in the SQL standard, such as its syntax for declaring local variables. Migrating code written using T-SQL to another database system may not be trivial, therefore.</p>&#13;
<p>In this book, the examples and code use the PostgreSQL database system. PostgreSQL, or simply Postgres, is a robust application that can handle <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xxv" id="Page_xxv"/>large amounts of data. Here are some reasons PostgreSQL is a great choice to use with this book:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li>It’s free.</li>&#13;
<li>It’s available for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.</li>&#13;
<li>Its SQL implementation aims to closely follow the SQL standard.</li>&#13;
<li>It’s widely used, so finding help online is easy.</li>&#13;
<li>Its geospatial extension, PostGIS, lets you analyze geometric data and perform mapping functions and is often used with mapping software such as QGIS.</li>&#13;
<li>It’s available in cloud computing environments such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud.</li>&#13;
<li>It’s a common choice as a data store for web applications, including those powered by the popular web framework Django.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p>The good news is that the fundamental concepts and much of the core SQL syntactical conventions of PostgreSQL will work across databases. So, if you’re using MySQL at work, you can employ much of what you learn here—or easily find parallel code concepts. When syntax is PostgreSQL-specific, I make sure to point that out. If you need to learn the SQL syntax of a system with features that deviate from the standard, such as Microsoft SQL Server’s T-SQL, you may want to further explore a resource focusing on that system.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-501065f06-0002">Why SQL?</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst">SQL certainly isn’t the only option for crunching data. Many people start with Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and their assortment of analytic functions. After working with Excel, they might graduate to Access, the database system built into some versions of Microsoft Office, which has a graphical query interface that makes it easy to get work done. So why learn SQL?</p>&#13;
<p>One reason is that Excel and Access have their limits. Excel currently allows 1,048,576 rows maximum per worksheet. Access limits database size to two gigabytes and limits columns to 255 per table. It’s not uncommon for datasets to surpass those limits. The last obstacle you want to discover while facing a deadline is that your database system doesn’t have the capacity to get the job done.</p>&#13;
<p>Using a robust SQL database system allows you to work with terabytes of data, multiple related tables, and thousands of columns. It gives you fine-grained control over the structure of your data, leading to efficiency, speed, and—most important—accuracy.</p>&#13;
<p>SQL is also an excellent adjunct to programming languages used in the data sciences, such as R and Python. If you use either language, you can connect to SQL databases and, in some cases, even incorporate SQL syntax directly into the language. For people with no background in programming <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xxvi" id="Page_xxvi"/>languages, SQL often serves as an easy-to-understand introduction into concepts related to data structures and programming logic.</p>&#13;
<p>Finally, SQL is useful beyond data analysis. If you delve into building online applications, you’ll find that databases provide the backend power for many common web frameworks, interactive maps, and content management systems. When you need to dig beneath the surface of these applications, the ability to manage data and databases with SQL will come in very handy.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-501065f06-0003">Who Is This Book For?</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Practical SQL</em> is for people who encounter data in their everyday lives and want to learn how to analyze, manage, and transform it. With that in mind, we cover real-world data and scenarios, such as US Census demographics, crime reports, and data about taxi rides in New York City. We aim to understand not only how SQL works but how we can use it to find valuable insights.</p>&#13;
<p>This book was written with people new to programming in mind, so the early chapters cover key basics about databases, data, and SQL syntax. Readers with some SQL experience should benefit from later chapters that cover more advanced topics, such as Geographical Information Systems (GIS). I assume that you know your way around your computer, including how to install programs, navigate your hard drive, and download files from the internet, but I don’t assume you have any experience with programming or data analysis.</p>&#13;
<h2 id="h1-501065f06-0004">What You’ll Learn</h2>&#13;
<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Practical SQL</em> starts with a chapter on setting up your system and getting the code and data examples and then moves through the basics of databases, queries, tables, and data that are common to SQL across many database systems. Chapters 14 to 19 cover topics more specific to PostgreSQL, such as full-text search, functions, and GIS. Although many chapters in this book can stand alone, you should work through the book sequentially to build on the fundamentals. Datasets presented in early chapters often reappear later, so following the book in order will help you stay on track.</p>&#13;

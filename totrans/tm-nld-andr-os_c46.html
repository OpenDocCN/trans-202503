</header>
<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">T</span>here’s general agreement that the launch of Droid is when Android’s growth really started. But even so, Android device sales lagged far behind iOS at the time, and other phone manufacturers still had significant market share at the time.</p>
<p>But in 2010, things really started to change, as other manufacturers came out with their own Android phones. Then it wasn’t just people buying the single Verizon phone, or Android fans buying G1s or Nexus phones—it was people all over the world buying all kinds of different Android phones.</p>
<p>Hiroshi talked about the OEM effect on the ecosystem. “The OEMs need to build devices. So by the time the next year came on, we started getting the Galaxy series, and then it really became sort of this mainstream product. It’s the traditional partnership thing, where there’s a lag. A turbo lag. There’s a little bit of lag in the beginning while things are spooling up. That’s what G1 and Droid were, just the spool-up period for the industry. And then all the partners, OEMs, kicked in, their products started launching, and that’s when the hockey-stick started.”</p>
<p>One of those OEMs was Samsung.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to deny the positive impact that Samsung has had on Android; they are the largest manufacturer of Android-based devices, and their Samsung <em>Galaxy</em> devices are <em>the</em> brand name in Android phones. Even the “exploding phone” problem with the Note 7 batteries,<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c46-footnote-1" id="c46-footnoteref-1">1</a></sup> an issue that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_350" title="350"/>would have decimated smaller companies, didn’t keep people from rushing to buy new devices when they were available.</p>
<p>Tom Moss signed up Samsung as an Android partner while he was living in Japan. Samsung was not the first to market with Android; they took some time to join the ecosystem. But when they did, they were all in.</p>
<p>“My job wasn’t just to cut deals. My job was to help foster an ecosystem. Part of that effort was to make sure that there was a balance in the force. At the time, HTC had this huge advantage over everyone else. The second phone, the third phone was HTC. They were charging a really high price to carriers for Android phones, which was bad because that would translate to a higher price for consumers.</p>
<p>“The point was to try and create this equal. We really needed an active ecosystem of OEMs competing with each other. So a big part of my job was not just signing an OEM—it was helping them to actually do something with it. With Samsung, for example, I had selected them to be our first launch phone for China.” That phone didn’t end up launching, but Samsung phones eventually launched elsewhere.</p>
<p>Tom talked about the changes the company made when they adopted Android, including committing a large marketing budget for these new Android-based devices. “Samsung believed. Back when OEMs weren’t spending anything, they were spending co-marketing to create the Galaxy brand.</p>
<p>“In Japan, I know they licensed Darth Vader from Lucasfilm, they had Ken Watanabe<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c46-footnote-2" id="c46-footnoteref-2">2</a></sup> as their spokesman. They hired thousands of engineers, designers . . . everything. JK Shin<sup class="FootnoteReference"><a href="#c46-footnote-3" id="c46-footnoteref-3">3</a></sup> bet the farm on Android for smartphones. They were the first to really spend on the last mile. They were the first to think about having Samsung sales reps in stores to help promote it, having little areas in the store. They did brilliant execution.</p>
<p>“The technology and the phones caught up later to where the business and sales went. But really, it was led by this strategy of marketing and sales that allowed them to leapfrog, and then their devices got better and better and better.”</p>
<p>Once the technology was there, they took on the smartphone market leader: Apple.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_351" title="351"/>“They did that brilliant marketing campaign of pitting them against the iPhone directly. They were kind of making fun of the iPhone, and people are like ‘Who’s this idiot company putting itself against the iPhone?’ But they changed the conversation from Android vs. iOS to iPhone versus Samsung Galaxy.</p>
<p>“Even on airplanes, you would hear, ‘Please turn off your iPhones and Samsung Galaxies’ instead of your Androids.”</p>

<html><head></head><body><section class="preface" epub:type="preface" id="introduction" title="Introduction"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title">Introduction</h2></div></div></div><p>I decided to write this book because it was the sort of book I wish I had had when I was starting out in information security. Though there are certainly more informative websites out there than when I first started, I still find it’s difficult for a beginner to know what to read first and where to get the expected prerequisite skills. Likewise, there are a lot of books on the market—several great ones on advanced topics, which require some background knowledge, and many good books aimed at beginners, which cover a significant amount of theory. But I haven’t found anything that says everything I want to say to the aspiring pentester who emails me looking for a place to start in information security.</p><p>In my teaching career I’ve always found that my favorite course to teach is Introduction to Pentesting. The students always have a thirst for knowledge that is lots of fun to be around. Thus, when I was approached by No Starch Press to write a book, this was the book I proposed. When I announced it, many people assumed I was writing a mobile security book, but while I considered that, I thought an introduction to pentesting would make the biggest impact on the audience I most wanted to reach.</p><div class="sect1" title="A Note of Thanks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="note_of_thanks" style="clear: both">A Note of Thanks</h2></div></div></div><p>A book like this would not be possible without many years of dedicated work on the part of the information security community. The tools and techniques discussed throughout this book are some of the ones my colleagues and I use regularly on engagements, and they’ve been developed through the combined efforts of pentesters and other security experts all over the world. I’ve contributed to some of these open source projects (such as Mona.py, which we’ll use in the exploit development chapters), and I hope this book will inspire you to do the same.</p><p>I want to take this opportunity to thank Offensive Security for creating and maintaining the Kali Linux pentesting distribution used widely in the field and throughout this book. A huge amount of credit also goes to the core developers of the Metasploit Framework, as well as its numerous community contributors. Thanks too to all the pentesters and researchers who have shared their knowledge, discoveries, and techniques with the community so that we can use them to assess the security posture of our clients more effectively, and so that teachers like me can use them with our students.</p><p>Thanks as well to the creators of the great books, blog posts, courses, and so on that have helped me achieve my goal of becoming a professional pentester. I now hope to share the knowledge I’ve gained with other aspiring pentesters.</p><p>You’ll find a list of additional resources (including courses and blogs) at the end of this book. These are some of the resources that I have found helpful on my own journey in infosec, and I encourage you to use them to learn more about the many penetration testing topics covered in this book. I hope you enjoy your journey as much as I have.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="About This Book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" id="about_this_book" style="clear: both">About This Book</h2></div></div></div><p>To work through this book, you will need to know how to install software on your computer. That’s it. You don’t need to be a Linux expert or know the nitty-gritty of how networking protocols work. When you encounter a topic that is not familiar to you, I encourage you to do some outside research beyond my explanations if you need to—but we will walk step-by-step through all the tools and techniques that may be new to you, starting with the Linux command line. When I started in information security, the closest thing I’d ever done to hacking was making the Windows XP pre-SP2 Start menu say <span class="emphasis"><em>Georgia</em></span> instead of <span class="emphasis"><em>Start</em></span>. And I was pretty proud of myself at the time.</p><p>And then I went to the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition and all the Red Team members were using the command line at rapid speed and making pop-up windows appear on my desktop from across a crowded room. All I knew was that I wanted to be like them. There was a lot of hard work between then and now, and there will be much more hard work as I endeavor to reach the highest level of information security. I only hope that with this book I can inspire more people to follow the same path.</p><div class="sect2" title="Part I: The Basics"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="part_i_the_basics">Part I: The Basics</h3></div></div></div><p>In <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="pr06.xhtml" title="Penetration Testing Primer">Penetration Testing Primer</a></strong></span>, we start out with some basic definitions of the phases of penetration testing. In <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch01.xhtml" title="Chapter 1. Setting Up Your Virtual Lab">Chapter 1</a></strong></span>, we build our small practice laboratory, which we will use to work through the exercises in this book. With many books, it’s possible to just download a few programs onto your existing platform, but to simulate a penetration test, our approach is a bit more involved. I recommend that you take the time to set up your lab and work through the hands-on examples with me. Though this book can serve as a reference and reminder in the field, I believe it is best to first practice your pentesting skills at home.</p><p>In <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch02.xhtml" title="Chapter 2. Using Kali Linux">Chapter 2</a></strong></span>, we start with the basics of using Kali Linux and Linux operating systems in general. Next, <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch03.xhtml" title="Chapter 3. Programming">Chapter 3</a></strong></span> covers the basics of programming. Some readers may already have a working knowledge in these areas and can skip past them. When I first started out, I had some programming experience in C and Java, but I didn’t have a background in scripting, and I had practically no background in Linux—a skillset that was assumed by most of the hacking tutorials I encountered. Thus, I have provided a primer here. If you are new to these areas, please do continue your studies outside of this book. Linux-based operating systems are becoming more and more prevalent as the platforms for mobile devices and web services, so skills in this area will benefit you even if you don’t pursue a career in information security. Likewise, knowing how to script your common tasks can only make your life easier, regardless of your career.</p><p>We look at the basics of using the Metasploit Framework, a tool we will leverage throughout this book, in <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch04.xhtml" title="Chapter 4. Using the Metasploit Framework">Chapter 4</a></strong></span>. Though we will also learn to perform many tasks without Metasploit, it is a go-to tool for many pentesters in the field and is constantly evolving to include the latest threats and techniques.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Part II: Assessments"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="part_ii_assessments">Part II: Assessments</h3></div></div></div><p>Next we start working through a simulated penetration test. In <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch05.xhtml" title="Chapter 5. Information Gathering">Chapter 5</a></strong></span>, we begin by gathering data about our target—both by searching freely available information online and by engaging our target systems. We then start searching for vulnerabilities using a combination of querying the systems and research in <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch06.xhtml" title="Chapter 6. Finding Vulnerabilities">Chapter 6</a></strong></span>. In <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch07.xhtml" title="Chapter 7. Capturing Traffic">Chapter 7</a></strong></span>, we look at techniques to capture traffic that might include sensitive data.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Part III: Attacks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="part_iii_attacks">Part III: Attacks</h3></div></div></div><p>Next, in <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch08.xhtml" title="Chapter 8. Exploitation">Chapter 8</a></strong></span>, we look at exploiting the vulnerabilities we found on the network with a variety of tools and techniques, including Metasploit and purely manual exploitation. We then look at methods for attacking what is often the weakest link in a network’s security—password management—in <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch09.xhtml" title="Chapter 9. Password Attacks">Chapter 9</a></strong></span>.</p><p>We next look at some more advanced exploitation techniques. Not all vulnerabilities are in a service listening on the network. Web browsers, PDF readers, Java, Microsoft Office—they all have been subject to security issues. As clients work harder to secure their networks, attacking client-side software may be the key to getting a foothold in the network. We look at leveraging client-side attacks in <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch10.xhtml" title="Chapter 10. Client-Side Exploitation">Chapter 10</a></strong></span>. In <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch11.xhtml" title="Chapter 11. Social Engineering">Chapter 11</a></strong></span>, we combine client-side attacks with a look at social engineering, or attacking the human element—the part of the environment that cannot be patched. After all, with client-side attacks, the software in question must open a malicious file of some sort, so we must convince the user to help us out. In <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch12.xhtml" title="Chapter 12. Bypassing Antivirus Applications">Chapter 12</a></strong></span>, we look at some methods of bypassing antivirus software, as many of your clients will deploy it. If you have high enough privileges on a system, you may be able to just turn antivirus programs off, but a better solution is to breeze right past antivirus programs undetected, which can be done even if you are saving malicious programs to the hard drive.</p><p>In <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch13.xhtml" title="Chapter 13. Post Exploitation">Chapter 13</a></strong></span>, we pick up with the next phase of our penetration test, post exploitation. Some say the pentest truly begins after exploitation. This is where you leverage your access to find additional systems to attack, sensitive information to steal, and so on. If you continue your penetration testing studies, you will spend a good deal of time working on the latest and greatest post-exploitation techniques.</p><p>After post exploitation, we look at a few additional skills you will need to be a well-rounded penetration tester. We will take a brief look at assessing the security of custom web applications in <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch14.xhtml" title="Chapter 14. Web Application Testing">Chapter 14</a></strong></span>. Everyone has a website these days, so it’s a good skill to cultivate. Next we will look at assessing the security of wireless networks in <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch15.xhtml" title="Chapter 15. Wireless Attacks">Chapter 15</a></strong></span>, looking at methods for cracking commonly deployed cryptographic systems.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Part IV: Exploit Development"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="part_iv_exploit_development">Part IV: Exploit Development</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch16.xhtml" title="Chapter 16. A Stack-Based Buffer Overflow in Linux">Chapter 16</a>, <a class="xref" href="ch17.xhtml" title="Chapter 17. A Stack-Based Buffer Overflow in Windows">Chapter 17</a>, <a class="xref" href="ch18.xhtml" title="Chapter 18. Structured Exception Handler Overwrites">Chapter 18</a>,</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch19.xhtml" title="Chapter 19. Fuzzing, Porting Exploits, and Metasploit Modules">Chapter 19</a></strong></span> discuss the basics of writing your own exploits. We will look at finding vulnerabilities, exploiting them with common techniques, and even writing our own Metasploit module. Up until these chapters, we have relied on tools and publicly available exploits for a lot of our exercises. As you advance in infosec, you may want to find new bugs (called zero-days) and report them to vendors for a possible bounty. You can then release a public exploit and/or Metasploit module to help other pentesters test their customers’ environments for the issue you discovered.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Part V: Mobile Hacking"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="part_v_mobile_hacking">Part V: Mobile Hacking</h3></div></div></div><p>Finally, in <span class="strong"><strong><a class="xref" href="ch20.xhtml" title="Chapter 20. Using the Smartphone Pentest Framework">Chapter 20</a></strong></span>, we close with a relatively new area of penetration testing—assessing the security of mobile devices. We look at my own tool, the Smartphone Pentest Framework. Perhaps after mastering the skills in this book, you will endeavor to develop and release a security tool of your own.</p><p>Of course, this book doesn’t cover every single facet of information security, nor every tool or technique. If it did, this book would have been several times longer and come out a good deal later, and I need to get back to my research. So here you have it: a hands-on introduction to hacking. It is an honor to be with you on this important step on your journey into information security. I hope that you learn a lot from this book and that it inspires you to continue your studies and become an active member of this exciting and rapidly developing field.</p></div></div></section></body></html>

			<p class="BodyFirst">I first want to thank Bill Pollock at No Starch Press for taking a chance on this slightly unusual book and letting me stay true to my artistic vision.</p>
			<p>I’d also like to thank all of the wonderful and hardworking folks at No Starch Press who helped create something of which we can all be proud: Barbara Yien, Dapinder Dosanjh, Jill Franklin, Patrick DiJusto, Bart Reed, Becky Stern, and everyone else who worked to make this book happen.</p>
			<p>Another big thank you goes out to Eric Wilhelm. Without his initial support, this book may have never come about.</p>
			<p>I’d also like to thank my community of peers who never cease to amaze and inspire me.</p>
			<p>Finally, I would like to thank my utterly amazing wife, Jenn. Her endless patience and encouragement helped me see this book through to the end.</p>

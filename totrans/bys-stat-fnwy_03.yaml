    use intuitively to understand how data informs our beliefs. We left a crucial
    issue unresolved: how can we quantify these tools? In probability theory, rather
    than describing beliefs with terms like *very low* and *high*, we need to assign
    real numbers to these beliefs. This allows us to create quantitative models of
    our understanding of the world. With these models, we can see just how much the

    a solid understanding of our current state of knowledge. In this chapter, we will
    apply this concept to quantify the probability of an event.'

- en: The idea of probability is deeply ingrained in our everyday language. Whenever
    you say something such as “That seems unlikely!” or “I would be surprised if that’s
    not the case” or “I’m not sure about that,” you’re making a claim about probability.
    Probability is a measurement of how strongly we believe things about the world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the previous chapter we used abstract, qualitative terms to describe our
    beliefs. To really analyze how we develop and change beliefs, we need to define
    exactly what a probability is by more formally quantifying *P*(*X*)—that is, how
    strongly we believe in *X*.
  prefs: []

- en: We can consider probability an extension of logic. In basic logic we have two
    values, true and false, which correspond to absolute beliefs. When we say something
    is true, it means that we are completely certain it is the case. While logic is
    useful for many problems, very rarely do we believe anything to be absolutely
    true or absolutely false; there is almost always some level of uncertainty in
    every decision we make. Probability allows us to extend logic to work with uncertain
    values between true and false.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Computers commonly represent true as 1 and false as 0, and we can use this model
    with probability as well. *P*(*X*) = 0 is the same as saying that *X* = false,
    and *P*(*X*) = 1 is the same as *X* = true. Between 0 and 1 we have an infinite
    range of possible values. A value closer to 0 means we are more certain that something
    is false, and a value closer to 1 means we’re more certain something is true.
    It’s worth noting that a value of 0.5 means that we are completely unsure whether
    something is true or false.

- en: 'Another important part of logic is *negation*. When we say “not true” we mean
    false. Likewise, saying “not false” means true. We want probability to work the
    same way, so we make sure that the probability of *X* and the negation of the
    probability of *X* sum to 1 (in other words, values are either *X*, or not *X*).
    We can express this using the following equation:'

    it from 1\. So, for example, if *P*(*X*) = 1, then its negation, 1 – *P*(*X*),
    must equal 0, conforming to our basic logic rules. And if *P*(*X*) = 0, then its
    negation 1 – *P*(*X*) = 1.

    pick values: say 0.95 means very certain, and 0.05 means very uncertain. However,

    used before. Instead, we need to use formal methods to calculate our probabilities.'

    flipping a coin and getting heads, catching the flu, or a UFO landing outside

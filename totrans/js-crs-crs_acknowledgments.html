<p class="TNI1">First of all, thank you to my wife, Philly, and our kids, Lyra and Hazel, for making this all worth it. I’m sorry so many of my evenings have been taken up with writing, and I promise I won’t write another book for at least a year!</p>
<p class="TX">Thanks to Bill Pollock for trusting me to write a second JavaScript book, to my editor Nathan Heidelberger for your excellent work in shaping my text (and for putting up with my many delays!), and to everyone else at No Starch for your work in turning this book into reality.</p>
<p class="TX">Thank you to my friend and tech reviewer Angus Croll for everything. Angus referred me to Twitter and later referred me to Bill Pollock—I wouldn’t be here writing this if it weren’t for him.</p>
<p class="TX">Finally, thanks to my parents for giving me the curiosity and optimism that ultimately led me to write this book.</p>

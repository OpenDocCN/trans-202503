<p class="ChapterIntro">There is far too much information about I<sup>2</sup>C controllers and peripheral devices to include in a single book. Even if it were possible, new I<sup>2</sup>C devices will undoubtedly appear during and after the publication of this book. To resolve this issue, this book is paired with several online chapters freely available at <a class="LinkURL" href="https://bookofi2c.randallhyde.com">https://bookofi2c.randallhyde.com</a>.</p>&#13;
<p>The following online chapters are currently planned for inclusion. At the time of printing, some may already be available, while others may be “in the works.” As time permits (and as new devices appear), I will attempt to add additional chapters not listed here. </p>&#13;
<ol class="none">&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 17: A Software Implementation on the Atto84</span>  This chapter contains overflow information from Chapter 3, describing a software implementation of the I<sup>2</sup>C on the Atto84 (ATtiny84) MCU.</li>&#13;
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_394" title="394"/><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 18: Teensy 4.<em>x</em> Low-Level I2C Peripheral Device</span>  This chapter provides a low-level peripheral driver for the Teensy 4.<em>x</em> MCUs.</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 19: The MCP4728 Quad Digital-to-Analog Converter</span>  Chapter 15 described the MCP4725 12-bit DAC. This chapter covers its big brother, the MCP4728 quad DAC.</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 20: The Maxim DS3502 Digital Potentiometer</span>  This chapter describes the DS3502 digital potentiometer, which allows you to implement a 7-bit resistive pot in software.</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 21: The DS3231 Precision RTC</span>  This chapter describes the DS3231 high-precision real-time clock—one of the more popular choices for real-time timekeeping on the I<sup>2</sup>C bus.</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 22: The MCP9600 Thermocouple Amplifier</span>  This chapter describes the MCP9600 I<sup>2</sup>C-based thermocouple amplifier and converter. By connecting a thermocouple to this device, you can measure high temperatures (depending on the thermocouple, well over 1,000°C).</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 23: I<sup>2</sup>C Displays</span>  This chapter discusses various I<sup>2</sup>C-based displays (LED and LCD) and display drivers. This chapter also describes an open source display library capable of controlling various displays.</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 24: The SX1509 GPIO Expander</span>  The SX1509 is another 16-bit GPIO expander (similar to, but less complex than, the MCP23017). This chapter describes programming the GPIO pins on that part.</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 25: The PCA9685 PWM Driver</span>  The PCA9685 is a 16-channel, 12-bit, pulse-width modulation driver. Typically, you would use this for LED dimming and motor speed control (or PWM analog output). This chapter describes programming this part.</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 26: The INA169 and INA218 Current Sensors</span>  The INA169 and INA218 ICs are current sensors that allow you to track the power used in a circuit. This is useful for battery monitoring and other circuits where you need to track the current through the system. This chapter discusses how to program each of these parts.</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 27: The MPR121 Capacitive Touch Sensor</span>  The MPR121 is a 12-channel capacitive touch controller that allows you to turn any marginally conductive item into a switch. This chapter describes how to program the MPR121 to read “button presses” using the capacitive controller.</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 28: The Alchitry FPGA</span>  SparkFun sells a nifty FPGA kit by Alchitry that provides I<sup>2</sup>C in hardware (no CPU required). This chapter provides examples on programming the Alchitry FPGAs to act as a peripheral.</li>&#13;
<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 29: The Raspberry Pi Pico</span>  The Raspberry Pi Pico is a popular microcontroller unit produced by the Raspberry Pi folks. Because of its inexpensive price tag, it has become extremely important. This chapter discusses programming I<sup>2</sup>C on this device.</li>&#13;
<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_395" title="395"/><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 30: The ESP32</span>  The ESP32 (along with the ESP 8266) is probably the most popular IoT controller used by hobbyists and professional embedded programmers. This chapter discusses using I<sup>2</sup>C on this MCU.</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p>In addition to these chapters, <a class="LinkURL" href="https://bookofi2c.randallhyde.com">https://bookofi2c.randallhyde.com</a> contains useful information such as sample builds (pictures and schematics) for many of the examples appearing throughout this book. It will also contain links to useful information concerning programming I<sup>2</sup>C controllers and peripherals. Check the website for the latest updates.</p>&#13;

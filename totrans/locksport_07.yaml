- en: Because of the cost of the tools and availability of the locks, competitions
    rarely have enough for everyone who wants to take part. The only fair way around
    this is a qualifier round using, for example, a single, easy lever lock with a
    short time limit. The fastest openings get through to the next rounds, which are
    head-to-head in the usual way. Generally, a certain number of preliminary rounds
    occur with four competitors each, and then a larger final round.

- en: The time limit, explained beforehand, is between five and nine minutes per lock.
    At the end of each time period, the locks are reset, and the entire field moves
    round-robin-style until all the contestants have picked all the locks. More contestants
    usually means less time per round.

    be in place, and you won’t be able to see the operating parts of the lock. You
    likely won’t be allowed to touch the tools until the time starts, so always check
    beforehand to see whether a qualifier round or test period is scheduled.

    and faster to simply walk from lock to lock, leaving the setup in place. The pace
    can be quite fast; in 2019, the LockCon lever picking contest was a mere five
    minutes a round, on locks with four throws. Granted, you’re not running the 100-meter
    sprint in under 10 seconds, but not partying all night before the competition

    as few as one, to complete the open.

    lever locks are unsuitable for competition. The Chubb 114, for instance, would
    be a terrible choice (see the 3G114 in [Figure 17-2](ch17.xhtml#ch17fig2)).
  id: totrans-21
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the Chubb 114 is new (unpicked), it’s extremely easy to pick. However,
    its knife-edged brass stump wears easily, and its levers rapidly take up the small
    amount of play from the manufacturing imperfections. Therefore, it quickly becomes
    much harder to pick, especially if it’s been subjected to lots of tension. Once
    “bedded in” with this wear, this lock can be nearly impossible to pick. This would
    obviously favor the first competitors, even if the same lock were used in each
    round (as is typically the case).

    creative and advanced ways that lock designers have invented to prevent picking
    and other attacks. Chubb created the Detector, for example, hundreds of years
    ago after an English naval dock was robbed via lockpicking. When the wrong key
    or a picking tool is used and lifts the trigger lever(s) too high, the Detector
    jams in the locked state, indicating that it’s been tampered with. The only way
    to reset it and reallow normal locking is to turn a correct key the *wrong* way.
    Antipressure devices are designed to frustrate picking by, for example, jamming
    all the levers if the lock bolt is tensioned.

    Often mounted on the back side of a door as a rim lock, with the resultant very
    long keys, these locks often also throw bolt work worthy of a safe: in three directions,
    requiring multiple turns of the key to open. Two complete rotations of the key
    will throw the bolt work four times, giving a high level of resistance to physical
    force, and the levers have four sets of gates that engage at different times.'

    In these locks, you use the lower half of the key to prevent the levers from lifting
    too high. The main difference in picking them is that, if you overlift, you can
    simply push the overlifted lever back down by pushing against the bottom of the
    lever.

    move up or down (although a picking arm on a Hobbs pick could push it up or down
    freely). The antipicks are fairly aggressive, but you can skip them if you reduce
    the tension enough, and the lack of individual springs means that the whole lock
    won’t likely reset.
  id: totrans-41
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other difference from single-bitted locks is that because of the absence
    of individual springs, in double-bitted locks the friction between adjacent levers
    tends to move them a little as you move their neighbors. You’ll frequently have
    to push the nonbinding levers back down, as they freely lift with the binding
    lever. You also need less force to move them, and they may or may not fall under
    gravity.

    on doors, but we also have hundreds of years of safe locks, containers, and padlocks,
    so you’re more likely to run into a variety in a competition. The locks could
    be noncurtained locks running from two to seven levers, with a huge difficulty
    range, or they could be curtained lever locks running from three to seven levers
    (though usually five).

    one, you’ll find the kit required differs significantly. Gone is the beautifully
    lathe-turned, precision-fitted 2-in-1 tool; instead, you’ll use bits of bent wire
    and maybe a cut-down key! You might even see something like precision-bent wires
    and CNC wire EDM tensioners.

    its competitions (the organizers obscure the brand and model on the locks they
    use). This is because the cost of swapping those locks for another type would
    be too high. In the MLA lever opening test, you have to tell the examiner what
    the lock is (multiple British Standard five-lever locks are assigned randomly,
    and the locksmith has to identify their lock via the keyhole, then open it, right-facing,
    within one hour). Since the organizers are unlikely to give much away, ask yourself

    of the picking tool must move separately and without binding or grinding, both
    forward and backward under the levers, and in rotation. Don’t confuse this with
    hitting the levers! Organizers usually check the tools between rounds, but if
    something seems wrong, speak up. Also say something if the pick simply spins freely—if
    a part has snapped off, you need to mention it right away.

    usually at the far side of the lock, but can also be in the middle of the lever
    pack, or at the front if the lock is facing the other way (bolt facing right).
    Nearly all current lever locks (bolt facing left) have the levers sitting either
    on both sides of the bolt or in front, nearest to you and the lock cap. The tool
    will be able to reach all the levers by design, even if they’re on both sides
    of the bolt, but you must ensure that you apply the tension *to the bolt*, not
    a random lever.

    [Figure 17-6](ch17.xhtml#ch17fig6)). When you have differently curved lever bellies,
    you’ll hit the bottom of some levers early, and others later. On some locks, this
    is a basis for decoding, but you’ll need free movement underneath the lever pack.
    Either your tool must allow this or you’ll be using a wire curtain pick, not a
    2-in-1, which can be “scooped” under the bellies at certain angles. This takes
    practice to avoid disturbing the levers or overlifting them, possibly over the
    true gate height.

    and a mainspring that resets the levers will be disabled by the tensioner. (At
    the high end, the lock could have antipressure stumps and detector mechanisms,
    but you won’t see those in a regular lock and certainly not in competition.) Also

    First, remember to hold the picking tool perpendicular to the lock case (see [Figure

- en: You might consider differences in approach for the final round(s) as opposed
    to the first round(s), given that you have a more difficult lock and more time.
    However, as a rule of thumb, stick with what’s been working! Bind and nudge, bind
    and nudge. Figure out where the antipicks are, reset and lift higher, and then
    bind and nudge, bind and nudge . . . If you can skip through the antipicks, remember
    how you did it in the earlier rounds—drop the tension off, keep light pressure
    on the target lever, pop it up and past the false gate, and repeat until open!

- en: If you get completely stuck, you can always reset the lock, taking it back to
    a known state. Make certain to reset the lock fully, though. For some locks with
    square antipicks, completely releasing the tension won’t reset the lock from an
    antipick, and in the extreme, you may need to drive the bolt back to fully locked
    to reset it. Likewise, with a single mainspring lock, you may need to turn the
    tension back a fair way to fully reset the lever pack.

    You *absolutely cannot* spin the picking tool to “flip” the lock around, as you
    can with a plug spinner on a pin tumbler lock. The design of the levers is such
    that they’re already blocking the stump’s next movement as they allow the first
    one. You’ll bend or break something and get thrown out. Instead, you’ll need to
    pick the lock again.

- en: Recall and apply what you learned in [Chapter 16](ch16.xhtml). Remember that
    for many double-bitted locks, the key is symmetrical, meaning the low lifts and
    the high lifts are reversed, so this would be your best place to start when picking
    the second throw. This isn’t the case for the best multithrow, double-bitted locks,
    where the two sets of bittings are independent. Even the best double-throw locks,
    however, must have the same first and third, then second and fourth, lever alignments,
    so the first high/low combination will work the same on the third turn, and so
    on.

    also want to throw in a lock that no one beat in the semifinals as a potent test
    of skill differentiation. Don’t go overboard with this idea, though—having no
    openings in the final will likely be boring and frustrating! Aim for the easier
    end of the range. You need to have some openings within the timescale you set.

    though unmodified. These were the identical make and model from several manufacturing
    years by a safe company that used the lock on an internal compartment. These had
    four levers, and the build quality appeared to vary little over the decades. These
    locks were simply held in a vise, with the bolts visible, and the competitors
    were forbidden from touching the lock itself (see [Figure 17-8](ch17.xhtml#ch17fig8)).

    picks himself.

- en: The 2019 LockCon lever lockpicking competition was organized and sponsored by
    Ivo Poletto, founder and owner of Parmakey in Italy. The Italian team running
    the competition used an Italian-made, double-bitted, four-throw safe lock (that
    is, two complete turns move the bolt four times) with an *electronically indicating*
    bolt position switch added, meaning that a light on each lock showed the bolt’s
    current position (see [Figure 17-9](ch17.xhtml#ch17fig9)). The first pick would
    turn the lock 180°, the second 360°, the third 540°, and the final the full 720°,
    and each turn would be tracked by the lights, which allowed the judges and audience
    to see each competitor’s progress and the timekeepers to record accurate times.

    use the locks again in future competitions and don’t want to give a tactical advantage
    to anyone who might buy and study those specific locks. The locks used were modified
    to make them more easily pickable (some levers or antipick features may have been
    removed), and, being relatively high-end, they didn’t observe the usual “high
    becomes low on the next throw” pattern, meaning they’re like two separate locks
    from a picking perspective.

    are over $60 (€50) each. The tools were custom-made to suit the lock and cost
    more than double that. Parmakey made 10 picking tools and brought 10 locks, and
    the electronic mounting block obscured the entire lock. (Seeing a round trio of
    bolts or the faceplate, for instance, would give an advantage to anyone familiar
    with the lock.)

    curtained, five-lever Kibb deadlock (see [Figure 17-10](ch17.xhtml#ch17fig10)).
    Four of the locks were modified such that the bolt couldn’t be fully retracted,
    instead hitting a microswitch, which in turn stopped the electronic timer. This
    prevented issues with the lock ever needing to be reset with a key. Ten sets of
    curtain-picking tools were supplied too.

    The top lever is unmodified, with square gate antipicks. The antipicks in Lever
    A have been filed almost completely away, meaning this lever binds very late in
    the picking order and is easily set correctly. Filing away the bottom edge of
    the square gate in Lever B meant that lifting the lever out of the antipick was
    far easier than having to do a full reset. One lever was also completely gutted
    into nothing more than a fancy spacing washer, which the stump would never touch
    unless the lever was lifted far, far too high.

    time and money is pretty high. The lowest price for tooling would be around the
    $87 (£70) mark, and while the locks might be relatively cheap, they would require
    modifications to ensure opening in a seven-minute round. For example, you’ll need
    a quick way to reset multithrow locks if they’ve only been thrown incompletely.
    You’ll also need to have the standard key modified to work in this scenario that
    the lock was surely designed to prevent; this modification will be easier with
    some models than others.

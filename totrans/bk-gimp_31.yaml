    pupil and is focused by the crystalline lens, and an image is formed in the back
    of the eye on the retina. The lens is flexible, and small muscles around it allow
    it to deform to change its focal length. This allows us to focus on objects at
    various distances. The diameter of the pupil is also variable, which provides
    a way to regulate the amount of light that enters the eye.'

    to brightness but not to differences in wavelength. On the other hand, cones just
    need enough light to work, but they’re really sensitive to wavelength. Cones are
    divided into three categories, depending on the wavelength they’re sensitive to.
    As [Figure A-4](apas01.html#sensitivity_of_the_three_categories_of_c "Figure A-4. Sensitivity
    of the three categories of cones") shows, blue cones are most sensitive to a wavelength
    of around 420 nanometers (nm), which corresponds to the color blue. Green cones
    are most sensitive at around 534 nm, and red cones are most sensitive around 564
    nm (which is actually yellow, not red). Also, blue cones represent only 1/50 of
    the total number; green cones represent approximately 2/5 of the total, and red
    cones represent approximately 3/5\. The black curve in [Figure A-4](apas01.html#sensitivity_of_the_three_categories_of_c

    the brain by cones sensitive to different wavelengths of light. The color range
    we can see is defined by the wavelength range our cones are sensitive to. As you
    will see later, most colors are not defined by a single wavelength; such *monochromatic*
    colors can be generated by artificial devices, but natural colors are generally
    a mixture of various wavelengths. We can only sense monochromatic colors that
    correspond to one of the three cone types. For example, our eyes can’t distinguish
    a monochromatic yellow from a yellow made by combining red and green light. Because
    we don’t have cones specifically sensitive to yellow, the resulting signals from
    our red and green cones are the same regardless of whether the yellow is made
    from red and green light or from pure yellow light.

    tiny subrange of the electromagnetic spectrum, without a blunt beginning or end.
    The visible spectrum has no real indigo color, and the red area is much larger
    than the others. The limits of the visible spectrum are fuzzy because the violet

    image is discretely represented. In the eye and the digital camera, each receptor
    generates a number to represent the intensity of the received signal. (Admittedly,
    this isn’t exactly the case with the retina, but the signal can be measured and
    quantified.) On photo paper, printed documents, and computer screens, the dots
    (or pixels) emit light according to some signal strength, which, in turn, can
    be represented with a number.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    dealing with grayscale images, for example, if we only consider the signal of
    rod cells or if we’re printing in black and white. If we introduce color, we need
    at least three values for each pixel or three types of cones in the retina.

    image or (at least) three numbers per pixel to represent a color image. To keep
    the representation of a pixel from taking up too much space, all representations
    use integer numbers in a limited subrange. The subrange for pixel values is [0
    to 255]. This subrange was chosen because it fits exactly into 1 byte of memory,
    which means a single color pixel will occupy 3 bytes.

    a color image, you have 256 possible values for each color, so you have 256 ×
    256 × 256, or 16, 777, 216 different color values. But professional photographers
    often prefer to use 2 bytes for each pixel, which results in the value subrange
    [0 to 65, 536]. Recall that 1 byte results in 2⁸ × 256 possible values, so 2 bytes
    leads to 2^(16) or 65,536 values. Whether our eyes can even distinguish such an
    enormous range of different values is open to debate.

    a pixel frequently uses 32 bits (or 4 bytes) because that size is more natural

    and it’s a power of 2 (think binary). The extra byte may be used to represent
    other things, such as transparency.

    a cube, as shown in [Figure A-37](apas03.html#rgb_cube "Figure A-37. The RGB cube").
    The corners of this cube are labeled with the fundamental colors, the secondary
    colors, and black and white. The diagonal that links the black corner (coordinates
    0,0,0) to the white corner (coordinates 255,255,255) is the *diagonal of grays*.
    Each point is opposite the point of its *complementary color*.

    get some darker color, not white. Pigment doesn’t follow the additive model.'

    For example, how do we get the color of a pink rose, clean copper, or mahogany
    wood? The answer could be 248,192,236 for the pink rose; 198, 113,76 for copper;
    and 100,0,0 for mahogany. All three of these materials appear to be dominated
    by red, yet pink and copper require a surprising amount of green and blue. (And
    the mahogany requires only a small amount of red.) Clearly, a more intuitive model
    would make image creation easier.

    colors are printed on paper, and their juxtaposition produces the effect of the
    subtractive method. Transparent inks can also be used in overlapping layers to

    colors is difficult, and black ink is relatively cheap, so most printers also
    include black and use the *CMYK model* (*K* stands for black).

    the three signals emitted by the three types of cones to the brain. The *R*, *G*,
    and *B* signals are first combined into *R* + *G*, *R* – *G* and *B* – (*R* +
    *G*). The *R* + *G* signal corresponds to what is called *luminance*. Luminance
    is equivalent to the value dimension in pigment colors, which goes from black
    to white. The blue component doesn’t contribute to the perceived lightness or
    darkness of a given color, possibly because of the very small proportion of blue
    cones present in the retina. The two other values (*R* – *G* and *B* – (*R* +
    *G*)) represent the *chrominance*, or the hue of the color. These concepts contributed

    way to represent colors. Conversions are required to switch between HSV and the
    other two models, but any modern computer can easily handle the computations needed.
    This model is the best one to use when you want to choose a color or build a color
    scheme for a project. The CMYK model is useful only for printing, and, in fact,
    most software tools for printing make the necessary conversion at the last minute,
    using information specific to the printer being used. The RGB model is a very
    important model because all images are internally represented using it. To sum
    up, images are stored as RGB, the HSV model provides an intuitive way to choose
    colors, and printing software usually converts an image to CMYK just before printing
    it.

    You probably didn’t close the app, but just *minimized* it. Minimizing hides the
    app from main view to prevent cluttering your screen, but you can bring it back
    easily! You can minimize an app yourself by clicking the minimize button, highlighted
    here.

    it again through the Start menu, as you did earlier in this lesson.

    your computer, though, it’s important to close any apps that are currently open.
    If you shut down the computer without closing the apps, you could lose the information
    or in-progress work in your open apps. To shut down your computer properly, follow

    for weeks, and then all of a sudden it won’t open, or when it does open, devices
    refuse to start. Feature problems typically occur when creating a new project
    or implementing a new feature in an existing project. Both problem types can be
    frustrating, and if you use GNS3 for any length of time, you’re likely to encounter
    at least one of them.

    indicates that something has changed. Something could have changed on your PC,
    within GNS3, or in the project itself. For GNS3’s part, it could be that you inadvertently
    changed a setting or made changes to a helper application such as Dynamips, QEMU,
    or VirtualBox. It could also mean that you upgraded to a problematic version of
    GNS3\. Whenever a new version of GNS3 is released, it’s always a good idea to
    test it using a spare PC or virtual machine before you upgrade your production
    environment. This section provides tips to help correct a few sudden problems.

    command. Both methods should resolve a permissions issue, but the `chmod`/`chown`
    method is less secure because it gives the Dynamips application the ability to
    run with full root-level permissions. If malicious code were to get into Dynamips,
    your entire Linux security could be compromised. The Linux `setcap` command allows
    you to assign root-like capabilities to a file, without actually giving the file
    root-level permissions. This gives Dynamips the permissions it needs, without
    compromising Linux security by over-subscribing root-level permissions. Therefore,
    it’s the preferred method to fix GNS3 NIO errors.

- en: Backing up your GNS3 projects is important, especially as they grow more complex
    and take more time to create. No one likes to lose the work they’ve spent hours
    creating! You can either back up the entire GNS3 folder, back up your projects
    folder, or back up individual project folders.

- en: Regularly backing up the entire GNS3 folder is the best way to ensure you always
    have a current copy of all projects and images, but it can be time-consuming and
    may require a fair amount of disk space.

- en: If you’re short on time or resources, at least back up individual projects from
    the projects folder. Make sure you still have a backup copy of your entire GNS3
    folder and then update the full GNS3 backup by copying individual projects to
    the backup as needed. The disadvantage to this approach is that it relies on you
    remembering to copy new or updated projects every time you update your backup,
    and you may forget to back up an important project. I know from experience that
    discovering you’ve just lost all the work that you put into a complex project
    can be a sobering revelation.

    as you create them. You could create large projects in phases and test each component
    along the way and, once you have a group of components working properly, back
    up the project. Then, repeat this procedure until the project is fully configured
    and your network is functional. Employing GNS3 snapshots while creating complex
    projects can also be helpful: if you make a mistake, just revert to a working
    state by restoring a snapshot (refer to [Using the GNS3 Toolbar](ch04.html#using_the_gns3_toolbar
    "Using the GNS3 Toolbar")). But no matter which backup strategy you choose, the
    simplest way to store your backup project files is by copying the entire project
    folder to a large thumb drive or external hard disk.'

    to ask for help. The GNS3 website (*[http://www.gns3.com/](http://www.gns3.com/)*)
    provides a plethora of information and houses a dedicated forum, called the *GNS3
    Jungle*. Here you can report problems, ask questions, and help other users with
    their questions. To access the GNS3 Jungle, go to the GNS3 site and select **Community**.

- en: Before posting a question, search the site to see whether your question has
    already been asked and answered. The GNS3 Jungle has an extremely active member
    base, so questions generally receive quick responses. If you do post a question
    and it doesn’t receive an answer as quickly as you’d like, please don’t repost
    it or reply to your own post to bump it up the list. Posting the same question
    multiple times will only confuse the people trying to help. Usually when a question
    goes unanswered, it’s because no one currently viewing the forum has the answer.
    Be patient, and someone should respond in due time.

    this appendix, you looked at some common problems and basic troubleshooting strategies
    for correcting those problems.

    application can wreak havoc on GNS3\. When in doubt, disable your firewall, disable
    your antivirus software, and close any unnecessary programs before launching GNS3.

    the project from a backup. You should always keep a current backup copy of the
    entire GNS3 folder and your GNS3 settings file. Restoring data from a backup is
    the surest way to get up and running after a disaster.

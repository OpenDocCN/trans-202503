    when a target visits a website and that website sends their browser to a different
    URL, potentially on a separate domain. Open redirects exploit the trust of a given
    domain to lure targets to a malicious website. A phishing attack can also accompany
    a redirect to trick users into believing they’re submitting information to a trusted
    site when, in reality, their information is being sent to a malicious site. When
    combined with other attacks, open redirects can also enable attackers to distribute
    malware from the malicious site or to steal OAuth tokens (a topic we’ll explore
    in [Chapter 17](ch17.xhtml#ch17)).

    typically considers open redirects too low risk to reward. The Open Web Application
    Security Project (OWASP), which is a community that focuses on application security
    and curates a list of the most critical security flaws in web applications, also
    removed open redirects from its 2017 list of top 10 vulnerabilities.

    and uses the `redirect_to` parameter’s value to determine where to redirect your
    browser. After doing so, Google servers return an HTTP response with a status
    code instructing the browser to redirect the user. Typically, the status code
    is 302, but in some cases it could be 301, 303, 307, or 308\. These HTTP response
    codes tell your browser that a page has been found; however, the code also informs
    the browser to make a `GET` request to the `redirect_to` parameter’s value, *[https://www.gmail.com/](https://www.gmail.com/)*,
    which is denoted in the HTTP response’s `Location` header. The `Location` header
    specifies where to redirect `GET` requests.

    First, the `content` attribute defines how long the browser waits before making

    attribute specifies the URL parameter in the website the browser makes the `GET`
    request to; in this case, `https://www.google.com`. Attackers can use this redirect
    behavior in situations where they have the ability to control the `content` attribute

    except in this case, Shopify’s parameter isn’t redirecting the user to the domain
    specified by the URL parameter; instead, the open redirect tacks the parameter’s
    value onto the end of a Shopify subdomain. Normally, this functionality would
    be used to redirect a user to a specific page on a given store. However, attackers
    can still manipulate these URLs into redirecting the browser away from Shopify’s
    subdomain and to an attacker’s website by adding characters to change the meaning
    of the URL.

    *interstitial web pages*, which display before the expected content. Any time
    you redirect a user to a URL, you can show an interstitial web page with a message
    explaining to the user that they’re leaving the domain they’re on. As a result,
    if the redirect page shows a fake login or tries to pretend to be the trusted
    domain, the user will know that they’re being redirected. This is the approach
    HackerOne takes when following most URLs off its site; for example, when following
    links in submitted reports.

    complications in the way sites interact with one another can lead to compromised
    links. HackerOne uses Zendesk, a customer service support ticketing system, for
    its *[https://support.hackerone.com/](https://support.hackerone.com/)* subdomain.
    Previously, when you followed *[hackerone.com](http://hackerone.com)* with */zendesk_session*,
    the browser redirected from HackerOne’s platform to HackerOne’s Zendesk platform
    without an interstitial page because URLs containing the *[hackerone.com](http://hackerone.com)*
    domain were trusted links. (HackerOne now redirects *[https://support.hackerone.com](https://support.hackerone.com)*
    to *[docs.hackerone.com](http://docs.hackerone.com)* unless you are submitting
    a support request via the URL */hc/en-us/requests/new*.) However, anyone could
    create custom Zendesk accounts and pass them to the `/redirect_to_account?state=`
    parameter. The custom Zendesk account could then redirect to another website not
    owned by Zendesk or HackerOne. Because Zendesk allowed for redirecting between
    accounts without interstitial pages, the user could be taken to the untrusted
    site without warning. As a solution, HackerOne identified links containing `zendesk_session`
    as external links, thereby rendering an interstitial warning page when clicked.

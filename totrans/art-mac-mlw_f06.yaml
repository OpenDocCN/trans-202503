    I’m pretty sure I’m not a computer, yet I too feel composed of unique individuals
    and communities. Even though there is a single name on the cover of this book,
    you would not be holding it in your hands today without them.

    the complexities of raising a child, deftly sublimating my rebellious tendencies
    into a creative and independent love of learning that has benefited me ever since.

    challenged and inspired me. Nothing like a never-ending sibling rivalry to bring
    out the best in us . . . right?

    larger the infosec community, whose guidance and support have been invaluable
    over the years. Though there are far too many to name in this short section, a
    few, namely my close friends and colleagues Kasey, Tom, Josh, and Jon, have had
    a profoundly positive influence on both my personal life and career. Others, such
    as the brilliant Jonathan Levin and Arnaud Abbati, have always selflessly provided
    indispensable technical insights and mentorship, giving me both the confidence
    and expertise to write this book. I am lucky to count both as close friends.

    on the book. These delightful (and, yes, sometimes strict) humans kept me roughly
    on schedule to bring this book to fruition. First, a big mahalo to Runa Sandvik
    for her invaluable input and editing skills on the initial draft of this book.
    Also, my good friend Tom McGuire (Tmac), who put countless hours into the rather
    thankless job of technical editor. Finally, a big thank you to the incredibly
    professional and hardworking crew at No Starch Press, including founder Bill Pollock
    and the book’s main editor, Frances Saux.

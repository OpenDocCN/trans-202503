- en: In the simplest terms, Bitcoin is just another currency. The term *Bitcoin*
    refers to the entire currency system, whereas *bitcoins* are the basic units of
    the currency.^([1](../Text/footnote.html#footnote1)) As with dollars, euros, yen,
    and gold coins, you can save bitcoins, spend them on goods and services, and exchange
    them for other currencies. However, Bitcoin is the world’s first currency that
    is both digital and decentralized.

- en: A *digital currency* is one that can be easily stored and used on a computer.
    By this definition, even dollars can be considered a digital currency, since they
    can be easily sent to others or used to shop online, but their supply is controlled
    by a centralized bank organization. In contrast, gold coins are *decentralized*,
    meaning that no central authority controls the supply of gold in the world. In
    fact, anyone can dig for gold, create new coins, and distribute them. However,
    unlike digital currencies, it’s not easy to use gold coins to pay for goods (at
    least not with exact change!), and it’s impossible to transfer gold coins over
    the Internet. Because Bitcoin combines these two properties, it is somewhat like
    digital gold. Never before has there been a currency with both these two properties,
    and its impact on our increasingly digital, globalized world may turn out to be
    significant.

    However, you should not consider Bitcoin to be in the same category as *private*
    currencies, hundreds of which have existed in various forms in the past.^([2](../Text/footnote.html#footnote2))
    Private currencies, whether issued by a person, a company, or a nonstate organization,
    are centrally controlled and run the risk of collapse due to bankruptcy or other
    economic failure. Bitcoin is not a company, nor does a single person or organization
    issue or control bitcoins; therefore, it has no central point of failure. For
    this reason, nobody can inflate the currency supply and create hyperinflation
    crises, such as those that occurred in post–World War I Germany and more recently
    in Zimbabwe.^([3](../Text/footnote.html#footnote3))

- en: Until recently, people could not send *digital cash* back and forth to each
    other in a reliable way without a central mediator. A trusted central mediator
    such as PayPal can track payments and money transfers in a privately held account
    ledger, but it wasn’t clear how a group of strangers who *do not* trust each other
    could accomplish the same transactions dependably.^([4](../Text/footnote.html#footnote4))
    Sometimes referred to as the Byzantine Generals’ Problem, this fundamental conundrum
    also emerges in computer science, specifically in how to achieve consensus on
    a distributed network.

- en: 'In 2008, the problem was elegantly solved by Bitcoin’s inventor, known pseudonymously
    as Satoshi Nakamoto. Satoshi’s significant breakthrough made it possible for a
    digital currency to exist without relying on a central authority. Satoshi described
    the solution to the Byzantine Generals’ Problem and the invention of Bitcoin in
    a white paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” But the
    creation of the software that demonstrated the concept in practice was released
    a year later.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although the first version of the software was written by Satoshi, it quickly
    became a community project as the software was improved and maintained by hundreds
    of volunteers. Currently, the software is open source, and anyone can read and
    contribute to it. In January of 2009, the first bitcoins were distributed using
    the early Bitcoin software, and since then transactions have been running smoothly.
    Slowly but surely, an increasing number of people have started using Bitcoin,
    and what began as an experiment is now a multibillion dollar economy that processes
    hundreds of thousands of transactions per day (and is growing quickly).

- en: Bitcoin is an inherently international currency; anyone can send bitcoins to
    anyone else in the world, in any amount, almost instantly. In addition, it is
    becoming increasingly possible to travel the world and spend bitcoins without
    having to change them into the local currency. Because no middleman is involved,
    transaction fees are negligible. Unlike with credit cards, which require giving
    online merchants your personal information, you can use bitcoins to shop online
    while maintaining your privacy. There is no risk of losing your savings due to
    runaway inflation because bitcoins were designed to have a fixed supply. Bitcoins
    are also fundamentally impossible to counterfeit.

- en: As a merchant, you can start accepting bitcoins as payment immediately without
    filling out tedious paperwork (compared to setting up the credit card transaction
    process). You can also own bitcoins without anyone else knowing, and no third
    party or government can seize your money. (The privacy this feature entails may
    protect the security and freedom of political dissidents living under repressive
    regimes, for example.)

    however, anyone familiar with Bitcoin will agree the technology behind it is difficult
    to explain and understand. At first blush, it’s hard to grasp how bitcoins are
    stored, how they are used, or even where they come from.

- en: Bitcoin can be compared to the advent of paper currency years ago when everyone
    was using gold and silver coins. Then, it must have seemed strange and confusing
    to attribute value to little pieces of paper instead of precious metals. Today,
    paper currency feels fairly safe, and trading paper for a purely digital asset
    like bitcoins seems odd. Furthermore, the economic and social consequences of
    switching to a decentralized digital currency are still unclear. Even Satoshi
    and the early volunteers who helped develop the concept could not have imagined
    precisely how Bitcoin would be used and valued by society, much as the creators
    of the Internet in the 1980s could not have predicted how transformative it would
    become.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Confusion also stems from the fact that Bitcoin is a truly complex technology.
    It relies not only on Satoshi’s breakthrough to achieving consensus on a distributed
    network but also on modern cryptographic techniques, such as digital signatures,
    public/private key pairs, and secure hashing. (These cryptographic concepts are
    covered in detail in [Chapter 7](../Text/ch07.html#ch07).) The issuing of new
    currency occurs through a cryptographic lottery called mining that anyone can
    participate in. Mining simultaneously processes transactions made by Bitcoin users.
    To resist abuse from those who might want to destroy the network, Bitcoin’s design
    uses game theory to align the incentives of those who maintain the network and
    those who want to act in their own selfish interest. (Bitcoin mining and game
    theory is explained in detail in [Chapter 8](../Text/ch08.html#ch08).)

    is an adventure story told from the perspective of Crowley the cryptographer.
    Crowley gets stranded on an island and needs to figure out how to efficiently
    exchange goods with inhabitants of other distant islands. Crowley knows about
    Bitcoin from a chance encounter with Satoshi but has significant doubts about
    the currency. In the story, he works through his doubts (which may be similar
    to yours) by giving Bitcoin a chance.

    For fields like particle physics, Egyptian history, or constitutional law, we

    to studying those subjects; by comparison nobody is really an expert on Bitcoin.
    Just as there were no electricians before the discovery of electricity or programming
    gurus before computers were invented, arguably no Bitcoin experts exist today.
    We are all Bitcoin beginners, and no one can predict with any clarity how Bitcoin
    will evolve, even a year or two into the future.

    this wonderful technology in years to come.

- en: You’ve come a long way in developing your iOS coding skills, which means you
    now have what it takes to make your own apps from scratch. The best way to get
    better at making apps is by making more apps. Think about an app that you’d love
    to make, and then make it! Choosing something that excites you will make it easy
    to stay motivated. With every app you work on, there will be something new you
    haven’t had to do before, and thus a new learning opportunity. Once you’ve explored
    some app ideas and have written a lot of code, you’ll have a better idea of what
    areas to focus on.

    navigator (⌘ -4), you can view the current list of errors and warnings. Warnings
    are in yellow and usually don’t have to be fixed (though it is strongly suggested
    you *do* fix them because they often turn into errors later). Errors are in red,
    and they must be fixed before the project will build. Sometimes the error message
    will tell you how to fix the issue, so make sure to read it and to also try to
    understand what’s causing the issue.

- en: • If the cause of the issue isn’t clear, it’s often helpful to tell Xcode to
    clean things up and try again. When you build a project in Xcode, it creates temporary
    files that are used to make future builds faster. Sometimes these files need to
    be removed so that the build process can create them again from scratch. There
    are two ways to “clean” in Xcode. You can clean the project with ⌘ -SHIFT -K,
    or you can clean the build folder with ⌘ -OPTION -SHIFT -K. Both methods do the
    same thing, but cleaning the build folder is more thorough. Try one or both of
    these, and then build the project again and see if the error goes away.

    will often take you to a website called Stack Overflow ( [*http://www.stackoverflow.com/*](http://www.stackoverflow.com)

    clean things up and try again. When you build a project in Xcode, it creates temporary
    files that are used to make future builds faster. Sometimes these files need to
    be removed so that the build process can create them again from scratch. There
    are two ways to “clean” in Xcode. You can clean the project with ⌘ -SHIFT -K,
    or you can clean the build folder with ⌘ -OPTION -SHIFT -K. Both methods do the

    these, and then build the project again and see if the error goes away.

    navigator (⌘ -4), you can view the current list of errors and warnings. Warnings
    are in yellow and usually don’t have to be fixed (though it is strongly suggested
    you *do* fix them because they often turn into errors later). Errors are in red,
    and they must be fixed before the project will build. Sometimes the error message
    will tell you how to fix the issue, so make sure to read it and to also try to
    understand what’s causing the issue.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: • If the cause of the issue isn’t clear, it’s often helpful to tell Xcode to
    clean things up and try again. When you build a project in Xcode, it creates temporary
    files that are used to make future builds faster. Sometimes these files need to
    be removed so that the build process can create them again from scratch. There
    are two ways to “clean” in Xcode. You can clean the project with ⌘ -SHIFT -K,
    or you can clean the build folder with ⌘ -OPTION -SHIFT -K. Both methods do the
    same thing, but cleaning the build folder is more thorough. Try one or both of
    these, and then build the project again and see if the error goes away.
  prefs: []

    the exact error message that Xcode is giving you so you can find other people

    will often take you to a website called Stack Overflow ( [*http://www.stackoverflow.com/*](http://www.stackoverflow.com)

    clean things up and try again. When you build a project in Xcode, it creates temporary
    files that are used to make future builds faster. Sometimes these files need to
    be removed so that the build process can create them again from scratch. There
    are two ways to “clean” in Xcode. You can clean the project with ⌘ -SHIFT -K,
    or you can clean the build folder with ⌘ -OPTION -SHIFT -K. Both methods do the
    same thing, but cleaning the build folder is more thorough. Try one or both of
    these, and then build the project again and see if the error goes away.

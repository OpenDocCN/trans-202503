<p class="ChapterIntro"><span class="dropCap">I</span>n the beginning, Android was building a digital camera platform called FotoFarm.</p>
<p>Digital camera technology in 2003 was becoming interesting; digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLRs) combined high-quality lenses with increasingly large sensors to capture more and more detail in digital image files. But the software for these cameras was . . . not great.</p>
<p>Andy Rubin, who had founded and recently left the mobile phone manufacturer Danger, was looking for a new project. Along with Chris White, a former colleague at WebTV, he started a new company to make better camera software. With Andy as CEO and Chris as CTO, they founded FotoFarm in late 2003 to provide an operating system for digital cameras. The software they envisioned would enable better UIs and networking, along with the ability <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_4" title="4"/>to run apps. Combined with superior camera hardware, they would push the boundaries of photographic and imaging functionality and experience. </p>
<p>Chris told Andy he thought they could come up with a better name than “FotoFarm.” Andy already had the URL android.com, so they changed the name to Android and hired the design firm Character to help create their corporate identity, including their logo and business cards.</p>
<p>All they needed was for investors to buy into their vision of an Android camera platform. But nobody else cared about cameras; everyone wanted to talk about phones.</p>
<p>Andy invited Nick Sears to meet with him at Android’s offices in Palo Alto to pitch the camera OS. The two had worked closely together on Danger’s phone, the T-Mobile Sidekick. Nick had decided to leave T-Mobile, but to continue working on mobile phones. He wanted to build a consumer smartphone that went beyond what they had been able to build at Danger. Nick felt that one of the reasons Danger hadn’t succeeded as much as they’d hoped was the interface and form factor of the device itself. “Everybody looked at it as this iconic device, but we knew that the form factor wasn’t small enough yet that people wanted to carry it in their hands. It was still a thick device and had to have the screen as a separate thing.”</p>
<p>Android’s vision didn’t appeal to Nick; he wasn’t interested in cameras. Phones were where his experience and his interests were. He told Andy, “If you change your mind and end up doing phones, give me a call.”</p>
<p>Soon after that conversation, Andy spoke with another colleague from the Danger days: Rich Miner. Rich, on behalf of his employer, the mobile carrier Orange, was an early investor in Danger. After getting to know Andy through that experience, Rich kept in touch to see what else he’d do in the future.</p>
<p>Rich, like Nick, suggested that Andy’s startup should consider building mobile phones instead of cameras. Rich had a long history with the mobile phone market and saw an opportunity for Android to make a difference there. Chris was also talking to Andy about that possibility. But Andy was still resistant.</p>
<p>Andy didn’t <em>want</em> to do phones again. He was ultimately frustrated by his experiences at Danger, which hadn’t turned out as well as he had hoped. But at the same time, he was pitching the camera idea to venture capitalists (VCs) and not getting any interest. Also, he was looking at the realities of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_5" title="5"/>camera market and saw that sales at the time were going down, as manufacturers started to put cameras in mobile phones.</p>
<p>In November of 2004, Andy was at another meeting with VCs. His pitch for the camera OS met with the same lack of interest. So he mentioned phones as a possibility and saw ears in the room perk up.</p>
<p>Andy gave up. He got back in touch with both Nick and Rich and told them that he was now ready to do a phone OS.</p>
<p>That was all that Rich and Nick needed. They both started working with Andy to pull together a business plan and a pitch deck around a phone OS. And in early 2005, they joined Android as co-founders.</p>
<p>Andy didn’t get to build his camera OS. But given how critical the camera is on phones today, you could argue that he created the most widely used camera OS ever; he just did it in a roundabout way.</p>

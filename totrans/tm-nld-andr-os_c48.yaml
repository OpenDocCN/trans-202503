    were fast. The speed of this team was nothing I’ve ever seen anywhere. Before
    or after.

- en: The Android team consisted, from the beginning, of people with the right skills
    and drive to build what was needed. Creating an entire platform, along with the
    applications, services, and infrastructure that Android needed, was a huge effort,
    and demanded strenuous effort by people who could dive in quickly to make things
    work.

- en: Most of the team came in with exactly the right experience, which allowed them
    to hit the ground running. Having worked on related platform and mobile projects
    at companies like Be, Danger, PalmSource, WebTV, and Microsoft, gave them the
    technical grounding in exactly the right domains to know how to approach similar
    problems that Android presented.

- en: The Android team grew as it approached 1.0, but only to a size of about 100
    people by the time of that first release. This meant that everyone had more than
    enough work to do to ship the product. But people did what they needed to do to
    move the work forward, including individuals owning large areas of functionality
    as well as working across multiple areas, wherever help was needed. Coupled with
    the startup environment that pushed everyone to work insanely hard in those early
    years, the team was able to write Android from scratch and deliver a robust platform
    and device in time to become relevant in the nascent smartphone industry.

    finish the project, but it also meant that they were much more efficient.

    years after 1.0: “He asked how big my team was. I told him 300 people. His eyes
    popped out, ‘With 300 people you could do a new Android!’'

- en: “I said ‘No. With 300 people, you couldn’t—you need 20 people.’ That larger
    team is riding on the code and practices built by the individuals that had consensus
    by default. In the early days, with all of the communication and coordination.
    . . . If you start with a big team, you spend all of your time debating.”

- en: Great teams benefit from great leadership to help everyone gel and drive forward
    together. One aspect of that leadership was sheltering Android and running it
    like a startup inside the big mothership of Google. Another aspect was having
    decisions being made by a single person, not by a group of people.

    type. The one person. Not a committee. Not five people. One person that was like,
    ‘This is the way I want it, and that’s the way it’s going to be and I don’t care.’

- en: “Having a single person at the top making these decisions resulted in the team
    and the product continuing to move toward the goal. It was making a decision,
    even if it’s not the right one, but just a decision to move the ball forward.
    You can’t steer if you’re not moving.”

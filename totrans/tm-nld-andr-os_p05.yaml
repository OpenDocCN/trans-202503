    We never would have reached the scale and the success that Android reached without
    that approach of partnership.'

    Here I pull it all together to answer the question: How did Android succeed? Given
    all the factors that could have led to its failure, and did just that for so many
    other companies and platforms trying to compete in the smartphone space in that
    same time period, why Android? As with any successful project, there were many
    contributing factors, but it all started with the team.'

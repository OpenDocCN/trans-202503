This is what retopology allows us to do. <span class="emphasis"><em>Retopology</em></span> is the process of creating new geometry over an existing mesh while maintaining the object’s basic shape and rebuilding its topology. Retopology allows us to split the tasks of creating the right shape and creating helpful topology, making it easier to produce the model we want.</p><p>In this chapter, you’ll learn how to use Blender’s Snapping tools and other retopology techniques to model new geometry over the surface of highpoly, sculpted meshes, like the ones we sculpted in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Sculpting">Chapter 6</a>. The result will be a final mesh that captures the details of the sculpts with fewer polygons and produces topology that subdivides well and is suitable for rigging and animation.</p><div class="sect1" title="The Basics"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both" id="basics">The Basics</h2></div></div></div><p>There are several ways to retopologize, but the most direct is to use Blender’s projection Snapping tools to create geometry directly on the surface of the mesh you want to retopologize.

The first is to use the Shrinkwrap modifier to project simple topology over the surface of a mesh. With this method, you first model a basic cage around the outside of your original model (as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#quick_retopology_with_the_shrinkwrap_mod" title="Figure 7-1. Quick retopology with the Shrinkwrap modifier. First, create a simple mesh around your high-poly original. Next, add a Shrinkwrap modifier to project the new mesh onto the original. Here, an arm is retopologized just by extruding a circle along its length, roughly scaling and rotating it into place, and then adding Subsurf and Shrinkwrap modifiers to fit the new mesh to the sculpt.">Figure 7-1</a>), extruding areas to create the topology you want. The cage needs to match the original shape only roughly because the next step is to add a Subsurf (or Multires) modifier and a Shrinkwrap modifier to the mesh, setting your original model as the target for the Shrinkwrap modifier. The Shrinkwrap modifier then automatically conforms the new mesh to the surface of the old one.</p><p>Shrinkwrap has a few methods for doing this, and it’s best to experiment to see what works best for your model. I’ve generally found the most useful methods to be the Nearest Surface Point and Project modes. Note that there are some extra options for Project mode and that you’ll need to turn on both Negative and Positive in the direction checkboxes in order for your mesh to project in both directions to conform to the target (unless the surface of the new mesh is always above or below the surface of the target).</p><div class="figure"><a id="quick_retopology_with_the_shrinkwrap_mod"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00138"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538518.png.jpg" alt="Quick retopology with the Shrinkwrap modifier.

Here, an arm is retopologized just by extruding a circle along its length, roughly scaling and rotating it into place, and then adding Subsurf and Shrinkwrap modifiers to fit the new mesh to the sculpt.</div></div><p>This method of retopologizing works well when you want to quickly retopologize a sculpt that needs a better base mesh—for example, if you started a head or even a whole body from a cube and then wanted a base mesh with topology that does a better job of supporting the basic forms.</p><p>The Shrinkwrap method is also useful for combining models composed of multiple pieces into a single mesh. For example, to create a one-piece version of the Mayan glyphs discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Sculpting">Chapter 6</a>, you could project a simple grid mesh onto the glyphs, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#projecting_a_grid_mesh_onto_the_glyphs_f" title="Figure 7-2. Projecting a grid mesh onto the glyphs from the Jungle Temple project results in a single mesh that captures all the details. This technique would make UV unwrapping and texturing very simple, but it would produce a much higher poly count. Top: The original glyphs. Bottom: The grid, projected onto the glyphs. Right: The modifier stack. The Shrinkwrap modifiers are repeated with a Subdivision Surface modifier and a Smooth modifier in between to help the second shrinkwrap get into all the tight corners.">Figure 7-2</a>. Notice that I’ve repeated the Shrinkwrap and Subsurf modifiers to capture all the details. This repeating of modifiers is a useful trick, especially when you are projecting onto a mesh with a lot of sharp corners or deep creases and folds, because the first shrinkwrap will miss details that aren’t visible when looking straight at the surface of the target mesh. The resulting mesh can then be easily sculpted or unwrapped and textured without having to work with multiple part meshes.</p><p>Another method for retopology uses Blender’s Bsurfaces add-on, which has some neat tools for retopology that allow you to draw lines with the grease pencil and have them automatically converted to a mesh, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#retopologizing_with_bsurfaces_by_drawing" title="Figure 7-3. Retopologizing with Bsurfaces by drawing polygons with the grease pencil. First, draw your desired mesh with the grease pencil, crossing strokes where you want a vertex to be created. Then, use the Add Surface button (in Edit mode) to create a mesh from your strokes.

Of course, this was the reason for retopologizing it, but still, it would be good to have a stand-in mesh that captures the details with a lower polygon count for me to draw my new topology over. The answer is decimation.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Decimation</em></span> is a process whereby a high-poly mesh is automatically simplified by collapsing small edges and polygons to reduce the model’s complexity while losing as little detail as possible. Blender has a Decimate modifier, but it’s a little slow and not always effective, so I often use another open source application called MeshLab (<span class="emphasis"><em><a class="ulink" href="http://www.meshlab.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">http://www.meshlab.sourceforge.net/</a></em></span>). To use MeshLab on a Blender sculpt, take the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Export your object as a wavefront object (<span class="emphasis"><em>.obj</em></span>) file (<span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span>▸<span class="strong"><strong>Export</strong></span>), making sure that the <span class="strong"><strong>Selected Only</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Apply Modifiers</strong></span> options are checked so that all modifiers are applied (including Multires) and that the details of your sculpt are preserved.

I began by adding a new plane in Object mode and applying a Mirror modifier to it. Then, I turned on Projection in the Snapping tools buttons. Next, I grabbed my plane in Edit mode and scaled and positioned it where I wanted to start my retopology from (the torso, in this case).</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title"><a id="ch07note01"/>Note</h3><p><span class="emphasis"><em>At this point, I thought carefully about what density of polygons I wanted in the final model. Scaling the first plane up or down and working to this scale made a big difference in the final poly count of the retopologized mesh. I generally tried to work at a similar scale to most of the important details of the original mesh.</em></span></p></div><p>With a starting point set, I began extruding (<span class="strong"><strong>E</strong></span>) from one edge of my original quad along the forms of the model (see <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#begin_by_creating_a_single_important_fac" title="Figure 7-6. Begin by creating a single important face loop quad by quad. Then, move on to others and fill in the areas in between.">Figure 7-6</a>), following the outline of the ribcage and torso muscles. This created a face loop that ran along an important form within the model. By filling in the surrounding areas and creating further face loops along other forms, we can work toward completely retopologizing our sculpt with topology that supports the forms we have sculpted. This creates a more efficient mesh for capturing the fine details when we subdivide it and makes it easy to unwrap and rig if we desire to later.</p><p>As I progressed over the model, many of the same general positions for face loops that I used in the base mesh were useful again. While overall the topology was more complex, creating face loops that ran around the armpit and shoulder and around the arms, legs, and neck resulted in clean, easy-to-modify topology (see <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#important_face_loopsdot_a_good_tip_when" title="Figure 7-7. Important face loops. A good tip when doing retopology is to view your new mesh on its own by pressing/(forward slash) to view just the selected objects. This will let you see how your retopologized mesh is progressing before pressing/to return to global view and continue modeling.">Figure 7-7</a>). Also, because the mesh was still broadly symmetrical, I only needed to retopologize half the body and use a Mirror modifier to fill in the other half.</p><p>For some areas, like the face, I began to shrink the polygons in order to pack more into the area’s smaller, more detailed forms. I created loops that ran around the eyes, nose, mouth, and outside of the ears (see <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#retopologizing_a_face_to_create_new_topo" title="Figure 7-8. Retopologizing a face to create new topology that follows the sculpted forms">Figure 7-8</a>). These loops both supported the forms of the face so that they weren’t lost or softened too much when subdivided and added extra density to these areas to allow for the addition of more details with the Multires modifier. (For specific tips on face topology, see <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#head_topology" title="Head Topology">Head Topology</a>.)</p><p>To create a mouth cavity, I extruded back from the edge loop surrounding the mouth and filled in the hole (see <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#adding_a_cavity_for_the_mouth" title="Figure 7-9. Adding a cavity for the mouth">Figure 7-9</a>). When we return to sculpt on this retopologized mesh, we’ll need to resculpt this area, but the mouth will now be able to be opened and posed.</p><p>For objects like the wings, where it can be difficult to see into tight areas, it can be handy to switch to perspective view (<span class="strong"><strong>5</strong></span>), which allows the camera to be moved in and around tight spaces. It can also be useful to restrict the view with <span class="smaller">ALT</span>-B.

To do this, I simply added a primitive, such as a cube or cylinder with approximately the right shape, and moved it into place. For example, in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#replacing_some_areas_of_the_sculpt_with" title="Figure 7-13. Replacing some areas of the sculpt with new, cleaner geometry.

Then, by extruding the new part to give it some thickness and adding some support loops around the edges, I created a raised area on the surface of the model.

While there is no one topology for every conceivable head, there are some important principles to consider. Mainly, when retopologizing a head, you should concentrate on creating face loops around the key features of the face, particularly the mouth and eyes, which will make it easy to deform the face into familiar shapes (see <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#headcomma_with_the_major_face_loops_high" title="Figure 7-19. The head, with the major face loops highlighted">Figure 7-19</a>). These principles apply whether you are retopologizing a sculpted head or modeling one from scratch.</p><p>By constructing the important areas of the face with nice topology first, it’s easier to join the rest of the head together. In general, I begin with the eyes and work down from the nose into the mouth. Then, I work backward through the cheeks, forehead, and ears. Lastly, I cover the rest of the head and on down the neck. By first building outward from the most important and complex parts of the head, you’ll have to sort out fewer problems with the topology in the areas that matter most.</p><div class="figure"><a id="headcomma_with_the_major_face_loops_high"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00156"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538554.png.jpg" alt="The head, with the major face loops highlighted"/></div></div><div class="figure-title">Figure 7-19. The head, with the major face loops highlighted</div></div><div class="sect2" title="Eyes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title" id="eyes-id00013">Eyes</h3></div></div></div><p>When creating or retopologizing a head, there should almost always be a clean ring of face loops around the eyes (see <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#eyesdot_adding_edge_loops_around_the_eye" title="Figure 7-20. The eyes.

These face loops should extend out from the outline of the eyelid to encompass the brows, the outer area of the bridge of the nose, and the upper surface of the cheekbones. This ring will make it easy to close the eyes or raise the eyebrows or cheeks, and it mirrors the underlying anatomy of the face: The <span class="emphasis"><em>orbicularis oculi</em></span> muscle surrounding the eye circles the eye in exactly the same fashion as this ring of face loops.</p><div class="figure"><a id="eyesdot_adding_edge_loops_around_the_eye"/><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><a id="med_id00157"/><img src="httpatomoreillycomsourcenostarchimages1538556.png.jpg" alt="The eyes.

Because the ear is mainly cartilage with no musculature or articulation, it is a pretty static feature of the head and thus a good place to hide awkward triangles if necessary. By defining the helix and antihelix (the outer and inner curved parts of the ear, shown in blue and green respectively in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#ear" title="Figure 7-23. The ear">Figure 7-23</a>) with edge loops that run down into the earlobe, we can make it easy to define the ear’s overall structure. The other main feature of the ear is the ear canal. In addition, it is sometimes handy when constructing the ear to try to have a single edge loop encircling the ear to make it easier to attach the ear to the head.

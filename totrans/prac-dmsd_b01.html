			<p class="BodyFirst">When I set out to write this book, I envisioned it as what you might call <em>an optimist’s guide to doomsday</em>: a merry stroll through the world of disaster preparedness. It would be a sharp rebuke to the endless apocalyptic mirages that slowly suffocate those glued to 24-hour cable news, but also a heartfelt suggestion to keep some cash and food on hand, just in case.</p>
			<p>My optimism stems from a simple truth: I am here because my ancestors, generation after generation, bet that things would get better. In the face of some of the darkest moments in human history, they worked hard, raised children, and took care of each other. They persevered through unimaginable terrors and periods of uncertainty far greater than what I stand to experience today. They didn’t always live happy lives, and sometimes their own anger or fear led them astray. But they never gave up. They bet on the future—and in doing so, they helped build a better world for all of us. I feel that I owe my children and grandchildren the same.</p>
			<p>
				Of course, the universe is a harsh mistress; optimism may be wise, but recklessness is not. The philosophy I try to preach is the ethos of joyful resiliency: the art of looking at the world around us, in all its chaotic glory, and resolutely asking what can go wrong—but never assuming that it <em>must</em> go wrong. It’s the art of not making bitter demands of others, but of reinventing ourselves to cleverly and confidently dispel the anxieties and frustrations of everyday life.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_222" title="222"/>The method isn’t bulletproof. Things don’t always go as anticipated, no matter how hard we may try to prepare for them. But then, whatever the misfortune, the ride can be less bumpy when we have a solid backup plan—and a few extra gallons of water, too.</p>

    MySQL Community Server is sufficient. We’ll discuss how to install it for your

    The website should detect the operating system you’re using, so you just need
    to download the latest version of the appropriate installer for your system. For
    macOS, I recommend one of the DMG Archive files: either the ARM installer for
    an M-series machine or the x86 installer for an Intel-based machine. For Windows,
    I suggest the Microsoft Software Installer (MSI).'

    that are offered. The only part of the installation you need to take special care
    with is when you’re asked to enter a password for the root user of the MySQL server.
    Choose a password you can remember, since you’ll need to provide this password
    in your PHP scripts that communicate with the database server.

- en: Once you’ve completed the installation process, the MySQL server should be ready
    to use with your PHP applications. The default installation will configure the
    server to start up and run in the background each time you restart your system,
    so you shouldn’t need to manually start the MySQL server before using it.

    *index.php* script that calls the phpinfo() function. As discussed in [Chapter
    1](chapter1.xhtml), this function prints out a detailed report about your PHP
    installation. [Listing B-1](#lisB-1) shows the *index.php* file you need.

    that both MySQL and SQLite are enabled.

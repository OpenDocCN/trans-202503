    for the lowest-level hardware development, who know every script in their toolchains
    by heart, and who can squeeze the last bit of performance out of a microcontroller’s
    firmware. However, when it comes to the security of embedded systems, I regularly
    discover a lack of knowledge in two fundamental areas.

    necessary to establish a secure development process. Second, even if they know
    some cryptographic algorithms by name, they may not fully understand their properties,
    parameters, and limits as well as the reasoning behind them. With that in mind,
    the first part of this book describes the foundational concepts required for developing
    secure products.

<p class="PCO">In <a href="chapter1.xhtml">Chapters 1</a> through <a href="chapter5.xhtml">5</a>, we will guide you through the tabletop exercise development process. This includes exploring the importance of tabletop exercises, the planning and development process, facilitation strategies, evaluation techniques, and steps to perform after the conclusion of your successful tabletop exercise. While every effort has been made to provide universally applicable guidance, you may need to provide minor alterations in order to align with your organizationâ€™s processes and cultural norms.</p>&#13;
